1,"Don't mind me, just crying my eyes out. This was WAY better than I remember it being, and I remember it being pretty darn good. J.K. Rowling is a writing goddess and I can't believe how much foresight and planning went into this series. She already hints at the horcruxes and many other things in this book that don't show up until much later. Definitely one of my favorites in the series (but I say that about all of them)!"
2,"Um. Wow. Yeah. That was freaking FANTASTIC!!!! Probably my favorite so far, just wow oh my gosh......WHAT EVEN!! I feel empowered and sad at the same time (sad because...you know). 5/5 stars of course! "
3,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: After a steady build, the series hits its stride. Deep and layered, it goes down smooth, never seeming overly complex."
4,One of my favorites in the series.The ending always gets to me and breaks my heart.
5,This series has taken a damn TURN!Watch my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEqu8...
6,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma."
7,"*To read more reviews by me visit Views & Reviews *I seriously have no idea why I still review these books when I have nothing new to say. I mean... J.K. Rowling is perfect. This series is perfect. And I dream day & night of going to Hogwarts. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to show you how I felt about this book:When I started the book:During the book:At the end: Umm.. Mam Rowling..All in allSorry for the lame review, readers. I just really don't know what to say.."
8,"I know what you think: Don’t I have anything to do instead of rereading 750 paged long book on my weekend. Of course I am: I could try to cook breads, cakes, muffins or any other carbs involved project and share at my social media account to risk myself turn into Thor’s big bellied image at last Avengers movie for consuming them incessantly like my most friends do till the quarantine ends (it will end eventually, right?) Wait a minute, I cannot do that! I can only pose with burned or overcooked things if I insist to cook. I can also resume home soccer matches with my husband dearest but there is nothing left called glass at our place and I am still stressed walking barefoot because there may be still a tiny threatening glass piece hid somewhere waiting for me! And of course: After Ozark, La Casa Da Papel, Tiger King and Unorthodox, I couldn’t find any appropriate content match with my taste. I’m already working on three books but on weekends: I’m suffering from melancholy and I prefer to do something make me happy in the past. ( Like keep watching Shaun of the Dead, Big Lebowski and Fight Club. Interestingly at your each rewatching séance, you’re catching another detail!) I already told third book is my favorite because it was the last piece that my three musketeers keep their innocence till they take their first steps to the dark side.And this book is the beginning of the dark side. This is the middle part of long installment. A big death will shake them to the cores and everything about their life will change forever. This is one of the darkest, more action packed, gripping, thrilling but also heartbreaking book of the series. When I first read it nearly 20 years ago, I didn’t get intimidated when I see the page numbers. On contrary I felt blessed because normally I have been finishing a Harry Potter novel in a day (At least I finished the first three books in one day! Correction: First book took me only half day. Thanks to my fast reading technique I improved at college years!)Book’s longevity was great news. I could spend more time in Harry Potter’s world!After reading the whirlwind Quidditch Cup competition parts, I adored blooming creativity and visionary scenes written by JKR. I went back to my younger, dumber self and remembered the times how I cherished the chapters, how I thrilled when Harry succeeded and how I flabbergasted after reading the shocking ending.I adored it again and I promised myself to read it another 20 years later. ( I hope I won’t be at quarantine next time)I recommend you to read the books give you time travel to your happy times at the past so you can handle the daily terrors and find the strength to carry hope into your near future. That’s why JKR is one of my all time favorite authors!"
9,"There is an incredibly somber mood that descends on me every time I finish this book in the series, and reading it with the illustrations did nothing to change that. I felt the drawings were impeccable, and I loved how some of the characters were reimagined to look a different way than portrayed in the movies, my favorite being Mad Eye Moody. Now, the long wait for the remainder of the illustrated editions. :("
10,Here's some pics from the new Illustrated Edition! I have no idea why this didn't show as being read but who cares. It's Harry Potter and I can reread and listen to them forever!! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
11," 4th read: October 2019 - April 2020 (Physical & Stephen Fry audiobook)  ★★★★★read for the 24 hour harry potter readathon 3rd read: June 2018 (Stephen Fry audiobook)  ★★★★★ 2nd read: June - July 2017  ★★★★★SOOO many good scenes they should have included in the movie! Like  SPEW, Moody confiscating the map, Hermione discovering Rita Skeeter as an unregistered animagus, etc.  AHHHH I wish they could have made a 10 hour movie to include everything lol."
12,"""I is a good elf""It's been proven three times now, that I always get ahead of myself when reviewing Harry Potter, incorrectly concluding the last one (out of the ones I've read so far) to be the best, but it cannot be helped. The standards are moved up - again. It's like Rowling just had a look at the first books, found them to be way too short, and came up with this one, which is much longer than the previous ones - combined! And the writing style keeps on improving, while plot getting more and more thrilling, making it oh so delightful to read.""Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?""It's great to have that feeling of 'how easy it is to read everything is' still being part of the author's narration. Though the events are being described in much more detail, it does not take away anything in terms of interest. On the contrary, the reader is kept well in suspense, with a number of twists, without making anything too unreal (relative to the world of magic that is). I don't recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one (again, I'm probably getting ahead of myself).""Alf-giant? Moi? I'ave - I'ave big bone!""As far as the environs go, I think it's safe to say that we've arrived at darker times, toward which the third book made way for. Though I loved the first three 'relatively-trouble-free' years, this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening, while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters. And the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much.I don't think I'll be able to rest well until I'm done with the series. I kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years, who had to wait year after year for the next book. Must've felt being under 'Crucio'.""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."""
13,Ahhh uwielbiam ten tom.
14,"“Differences of habit, language and gender are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”- Not J.K. Rowling, I'm afraid.I love Harry Potter as much as anyone, which is why I urge everyone who spends money on these books to also support the trans community.To say it with the author's words: “If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” Well.Here’s a list of organisations that support trans lives (feel free to reach out and recommend more). Every penny counts:Mermaids UKThe Trevor ProjectBlack Visions Collective because Black trans lives matter.Find more of my books on Instagram"
15,"This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called ""experts"" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don’t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn’t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already ""been there done that"" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn’t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling’s breezy, “ear friendly” prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It’s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

True fans of the book series will never be 100% satisfied and this is the case here as well. They pointed out that Sirius is all but missing from the movie, which is really too bad- cause the book really built that relationship and showed how much Sirius cares for Harry.This concludes my reading/listening/watching of book 4. Thanks for riding along with me!"
17,"“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”So this quote kind of sums up what “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” was really about and I think it was cleverly done. ;-) As always there’s so much to talk about and I decided to continue with another of my “My thoughts about this book” reviews. For HP this seems to be the best solution because otherwise I’d end up writing 5.000 words essays and we all know that 1.) Goodreads won’t let me post them and 2.) No one would even want to read so much! *lol* So random thoughts it is! 1.) ”Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill.I found it really odd that the term “Death Eaters” was mentioned and explained for the very first time in here. I mean Voldemort and his Death Eaters are one of the first things that come to mind when you think about HP. I thought it would have been mentioned in one of the earlier books already, but nope, it really was the first mention. Knowing the Death Eaters will accompany us for the rest of the series this was kind of shocking. XD2.) ”I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough O.W.Ls? Oh, Fred... George...”Mrs. Weasley is legit one of the best moms ever and you can feel her love for all of her kids including Hermione and Harry. So yes, this a Molly Weasley appreciation moment and I still think that she is one of the most underrated characters in the entire series! I love that woman! <33.) ”Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily. Hermione clearly found her self-confidence and poise after “The Prisoner of Azkaban”. XD I loved how she always retorted comments that were thrown at her. She’s so smart it was a pleasure to see her stand up for herself! (and others) And yes, I admit it, just like Ron I wanted to hold the memory of Malfoy the bouncing little ferret in my mind. *lol*4.) ”How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared.”Ahh Mad-Eye Moody! As much as I agreed with a lot of the things he said, I also disagreed with a lot of the things he did. Does that even make sense? XD For me Mad-Eye is one of those super morally grey characters because he sometimes does bad things for “the greater good”. Then again his character is consistent too because as an Auror he saw what dark wizards are capable of and he’s totally right when he says that they won’t play nice and fair. Guess I’ll always feel conflicted about him. 5.) ”Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh, yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner – I mean lesson – what’s for eating?”Neville will always break my heart. That poor boy deserved so much better than he got and I’ve such a soft spot for him. He’s another of those Hogwarts characters I really would have loved to read more about and no matter what people think: He is brave and a true Gryffindor! <36.) Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”And here we have another reason why Snape can’t be redeemed. He’s just nasty and mean to his students and a real bully. No matter what happened in his past, he should know better than to let his students suffer for it. I still think that movie Snape is way nicer than book Snape and if you only know book Snape you know why I don’t like him. I might understand his reasons, but I still hate him. >_<7.) ”Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.I love Dobby so much! <333 He’s such an adorable and sweet guy and it was so good to see him so happy! He’s probably the only house elf that appreciates his freedom but considering his former masters it’s no wonder he’s happy to do what he wants. *lol* Guess you’ve to experience the Malfoy’s as your masters to truly appreciate freedom. ;-P8.) ”Oh, I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?”“Er – yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.*sighs* I usually like Ron but I never liked his “Goblet of Fire” version and I still don’t. I mean yes, he’s a teenage boy who’s going through puberty but that doesn’t excuse the many horrible things he does and says in this one. To say it plainly he’s a total dumbass in GoF and I really don’t like him. At least in this book. First he doesn’t believe Harry and then he’s hurting Hermione whenever he opens his mouth, just because his teenage hormones apparently make it hard to think before he says something. We could blame it on puberty but I think there’s so much more going on... Luckily Hermione is clever enough to see through it. 9.) ”Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.”And here’s another breadcrumb that will be relevant in the next book. XD You gotta love how Rowling scatters them in the earlier books and makes use of them later on. ;-)10.) ”If you really want to know, he – he said he’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage!”So after three books we dive right into the teenage drama and angst. Which is kind of suitable for their age but boy, did it impact their friendship in this one. I think from now on there’s no book in which they don’t have a conflict of some sort. No matter if it’s Ron/Harry or Hermione/Ron. There always seems to be something brewing between the trio. And bless Victor Krum for realizing how beautiful Hermione is! If none of the two boys at her side can see it, at least Victor can! I think he knows her value way more than her closest friends and I really appreciate him for it. =)11.) ”Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.Harry giving Rita Skeeter a piece of his mind is one of the best things in this book. That woman is horrible and she’ll only get even worse as the series proceeds. Harry’s got guts to confront her directly and I just love him for it. 12.) But Sirius shook his head and said. “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”And here’s another character I’d love to see more of! Sirius Black is one of the best and I loved how protective he’s of Harry! He’s like a lion protecting his pup and I lived and breathed for it. After everything Harry went through he deserves someone who loves him and stands up for him. Even if it’s against Dumbledore because he wants Harry to rest and feel better instead of recounting events. Sirius placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder and defending him against Dumbledore’s questions really made my day! Best guardian ever!13.) ”Yes,” said Harry. “Professor – I was in Divination just now, and – er – I fell asleep.”He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.”Haha! As much as I disliked Dumbledore forcing Harry to relive that horrible night I still can’t help but love him for his attitude. He’s one of the best teachers ever and the fact he didn’t even bat an eye when Harry told him that he fell asleep in Divination. Priceless! *lol*14.)  ”And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason – he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible...”I LOVE Harry so damn much, I can’t even! He’s one hell of a brave boy and I can’t even imagine how terrified he must have been. Yet he still refused to back down and didn’t give Voldemort the satisfaction of seeing him cower in front of him. This moment shows the true Gryffindor in him and why he got sorted into the house. When push comes to shove Harry always does the right and noble thing! <3 My precious boy! 15.)  ”Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered – it seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents...”“That’s right, Harry... just let go, now...”This moment always makes me cry! Cedric Diggory’s death is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in this series and it will always break my heart. No matter how often I read it, it’s still devastating. And Harry’s reaction to it, knowing that he could have been alive if he would have touched that portkey without him... It’s the first time that he has to live with the death of someone he knew and liked and it’s even worse because he feels guilty. What if he would have done the egoistic thing and won the tournament? What if he wouldn’t have offered Cedric to win together? For the first time ever his sense of fairness and his honour brought death to someone and his feelings are so complex I could cry. He did the right thing but it ended badly and left him devastated. If that’s not the symbolical embodiment of growing up then I don’t know.16.)  Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. “Come along... hospital wing...”To see McGonagall show so much emotion about broke me. This woman is always so composed and knows exactly what she’s doing but for the first time ever she can’t seem to be able to ignore her own feelings. She cares about Harry deeply and it never showed as much as after Cedric’s death. Such a great and beautiful scene! 17.)  ”Fail to act – and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” Well, and that’s about exactly what happens. Fudge didn’t take Harry’s story seriously and the wizarding world had to pay the price for his ignorance. It’s kind of eerie how Rowling captured politics and how the fact that they work so slowly is standing in their own way. At first Fudge didn’t react and once he did, it was too slow to make a difference. He kind of dug his own grave with his actions at the end of GoF and history will indeed remember him as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort to take a second shot at power.  “The Order of the Phoenix” is up next and it’s the last book I have to borrow from the library because I actually have book 6 and 7 in English at home. =) So let’s hope I’ll be able to borrow book 5 soon. ____________________________________I always forget how serious those books become.“The Prisoner of Azkaban” was already very dark but I think “The Goblet of Fire” stepped it up a notch. The ending will always get me, no matter how old I am. >_<Full RTC soon! Stay tuned!P.S: I borrowed this twice from my library. *lol* That’s how I was able to continue. Thankfully they have a lot of copies of HP! XD____________________________________I just borrowed this from my library but of course someone else already preordered it again. >_<So I guess that means I’ll have to be fast and start now!617 pages with a super tiny font. I CAN DO THIS!!!Or well, at least I hope I can. *lol*Regardless of everything I just said “The Goblet of Fire” has always been one of my favourite HP books. I’m curious if I’ll feel the same way after rereading it now. Which HP book is your favourite and why? =)"
18,"Complete 5 Golden Starsone of my favouritesall the thrills, mysteries, the competition, more lovely characters. (some more jerks too that I wanted to hit their heads at the wall)THAT ENDING!Now I'm writing this, after many times re-read, I exactly remembered my first reaction after finishing this book, after that horror in the end of the book, I was awestruck; ""WHY THIS BOOK IS OVER!? give me more!"" & then there was no book 5, you see the pain? after the biggest plot twists of the series (which I was looking forward to it so much) I had to wait!Harry Potter series was my first in many things; my first novel, my first fantasy, my first book crush, & one of them was my first Cliffhanger!this book is the point that the world started to getting Darker & a little out of mere-middle-grade-ish part. not that previous books were childish, but they're fun & cute & the protagonists are younger; suitable for both kids & young readers, but now things getting more serious & dark.I love how Rowling's slowly revealing the wizarding world's secrets to us, each book has something new about the world. we have time to process the interesting new info & remember it later. (the complete opposite of info-dump) & I believe it's a talent.& here it's about the first war & You know who's followers & rituals.We're also about to see the Quidditch World Cup (Fudge was so funny here!) & getting more information about the magical educations around the world.the plot; we knew something were off, but we can't exactly pinpointed it until the end when the truth revealed. Rowling knows how to reveal a plot twist in the most shocking way. (she actually proved it a few times in book 1, 2 & 3! but still surprising how brilliant it is.)Harry's suddenly in trouble & he doesn't know how.I like Krum.& all the predicaments the Trio should struggle through made by Rita Skeeter, bullies & the mean students, but they didn't cower or hide, they held their head high & ignoring them.I always loved villains in disguises, they are interesting & cunning & we can't tell until they revealed their secrets. the feel of bewildered betrayal the hero going through.the writing style is fun as always, comparing to book one, it has improved a lot, now it's graceful & rich.the villain's chapter was the best villain-ish/not-Harry-related POV in the whole series; intriguing & spooky.the movie was good, but didn't do the justice toward the book, it felt so rushed & deleted many parts of the book.I would've liked to see the Quidditch World cup Final match on the screen, the real ""interesting"" 3rd task & the Sphinx, the hilarious scenes by Ludo, Dobby, Winky & her story or showing the stubborn stupid refusal of that gargoyle to accept the truth & the cleavage in the society in the end.& while fans are angry about ""Dumbledore asked calmly"" part that turned out the total opposite in the movie (& I totally LAUGHED at that part everytime I reach that moment in either the book or the movie), I'm MAD at how movie Harry acted out-of-character in one scene in the movie (just because increasing the thrills I suppose) when he did exactly the opposite in the book."

“He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.”
* My heart broke for Harry several times. The childhood traumas he’s suffered are too much, too unfair. * Dumbledore will always remain the baddest son of a bitch. The end of these books remain pure gold because of him. * Cornelius Fudge represents Trump nicely in this book. * Am I the only one that still doesn’t hate Snape? My guy has been living a double life his whole life. Still a dick, but you know, a redeemable one. * Hermoine figuring out Rita Skeeter’s secret was a proud moment. * I love that Harry gave the Weasley Twins his winnings! My love for this series just knows no bounds. 5 glorious stars. Always."
21,"English (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) / Italiano«The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the Riddle House”, even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there»Maybe this time I was out of line with the bedtime reading to my daughter, not so much for the size of the book, but for its darker content compared to the previous ones. Towards the end of this fourth book in the Harry Potter series, my little girl had difficulty falling asleep. I had to defuse the situation.The Quidditch World Cup is coming, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have the chance to watch the final round, before the start of the new school year. This time problems start even earlier than the end of the summer vacation, far from the walls of Hogwarts... Many pages, many events, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the Triwizard Tournament, the tasks to face. There is always something to understand, some mystery to unveil. Great food for our ""potterian"" curiosity. But be warned, Dumbledore warns us:«Curiosity is not a sin. But we should exercise caution with our curiosity...»Caution... easy to say!Vote: 9«Gli abitanti di Little Hangleton la chiamavano ancora Casa Riddle, anche se erano passati tanti anni da quando i Riddle ci abitavano»Forse stavolta ho esagerato con la lettura serale per mia figlia. Non tanto per la mole, quanto per il contenuto, più cupo dei precedenti. Verso la fine di questo quarto libro della serie, la mia bambina aveva difficoltà ad addormentarsi. Ho dovuto sdrammatizzare non poco.La Coppa del Mondo di Quidditch è alle porte, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione hanno la possibilità di vedere dal vivo la finale, prima dell'inizio del nuovo anno scolastico. Questa volta i problemi si presentano ancor prima della fine delle vacanze estive, lontano dalle mura di Hogwarts... Pagine dense di eventi e di nuove conoscenze, tra cui il nuovo insegnante di Difesa dalle Arti Oscure. E poi il Torneo Tremaghi, e le prove da affrontare. C'è sempre qualcosa da capire, qualche mistero da svelare. Ottimo cibo per la nostra ""potteriana"" curiosità. Attenzione però, Silente ci avverte:«La curiosità non è un peccato. Ma dovremmo andarci cauti, con la curiosità...»Cauti... è una parola!Voto: 9"
22,"“The truth is generally preferable to lies.”-Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireJK Rowling knows how to write highly readable text. She specializes in short, highly digestible paragraphs. The pages flow pretty quickly.She also elevates the problems of Harry Potter from just one boy to good versus evil.However, this book was too long. I wish that Rowling shortened the book, cutting out Rita Skeeter, Quidditch, and The Yule Ball. She could have easily sold these bits of Harry Potter as short stories.

23,"It might take me 2 more years to finally make it through this series, but whatever...it's called savoring, people lol..."
24,"Best one so far!
""Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to the boy who was good, was kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.""

26,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4), J.K. RowlingHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series, written by British author J. K. Rowling. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete. Definitely one of my favorites in the series.The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive!تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست ماه آگوست سال2001میلادیعنوان: هری پاتر و جام آتش؛ نویسنده: جی کی رولینگ؛ برگردان، ویدا اسلامیه؛ تهران، تندیس؛ سال1382؛ چاپ اول و دوم سال1379؛ چاپ بیست و هفت، سال1396؛ چاپ سی و سوم سال1399؛ در414ص؛ شابک9789645757050 موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 21معنوان: «هری پاتر و جام آتش» را با برگردان: مهدی قراچه داغی، و شیرین لارودی (افراشی)، نشر ذهن آویز در سال1379هجری خورشیدی در567ص؛ چاپ دوم سال1380؛ شابک964920691؛ عنوان: ه‍ری‌ پ‍ات‍ر و ج‍ام‌ آت‍ش؛ نویسنده: ج‌.ک رول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ ت‍رج‍م‍ه‌ پ‍رت‍و اش‍راق‌؛ تهران، ناهید، جار؛ سال1380؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره دو جلدی9646205291؛ چاپ دوم سال1380؛ چاپ سوم سال1381؛ چاپ چهارم سال1382؛ چاپ پنجم سال1386؛ شابک9789646205307؛ عنوان: ه‍ری‌ پ‍ات‍ر و ج‍ام‌ آت‍ش‌؛ ن‍وش‍ت‍ه‌ ج‍ی‌.ک‍ی رول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌‏‫؛ مت‍رج‍م‌ م‍ح‍م‍د ق‍ص‍اع‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌: م‍وس‍س‍ه‌ ف‍ره‍ن‍گ‍ی‌ و ه‍ن‍ری‌ آی‍ن‍ده‌‌ن‍گ‍ار، سال1380؛ در820ص؛ شابک649270736؛عنوان: ه‍ری‌ پ‍ات‍ر و ج‍ام‌ آت‍ش؛ ج‍ی‌.ک‍ی‌ رول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ مت‍رج‍م‌ ف‍ری‍دون‌ ق‍اض‍ی‌ن‍ژاد‏‫؛ وی‍رای‍ش‌ ن‍س‍ی‍م‌ ع‍زی‍زی‌؛ تهران، روزگار، جوان، سال1381؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9649306196؛عنوان: ه‍ری‌ پ‍ات‍ر و ج‍ام‌ آت‍ش‌؛ ن‍وی‍س‍ن‍ده‌ ج‌.ک رول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌؛ م‍ت‍رج‍م‌ م‍رت‍ض‍ی‌ م‍دن‍ی‌ن‍ژاد‏‫؛ وی‍راس‍ت‍ار م‍ل‍ک‌س‍ی‍م‍ا طاه‍ری‌؛ تهران، هیرمند، سال1381؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9646974546؛عنوان: ه‍ری‌ پ‍ات‍ر و ج‍ام‌ آت‍ش‌؛ ج‍ی‌ ک‍ی‌ رول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌‏‫؛ ت‍رج‍م‍ه‌ ام‍ی‍رش‍ه‍ری‍ار ام‍ی‍ن‍ی‍ان‌؛ تهران، مهرآرمین، سال1382؛ در560ص؛ شابک9649434615؛ چاپ دیگر ت‍ه‍ران‌: م‍وس‍س‍ه‌ ف‍ره‍ن‍گ‍ی‌، ان‍ت‍ش‍ارات‍ی‌ آف‍ری‍ن‍ه‌، سال1379؛ در650ص؛ شابک9646191592؛عنوان: ه‍ری ‌‌پ‍ات‍ر و ج��ام‌ آت‍ش‌؛ ن‍ویسنده‌ ج‍ی‌ک‍ی‌ اول‍ی‍ن‍گ‌‏‫؛ م‍ت‍رج‍م‌ ای‍رن‌ ع‍ل‍ی‍پ‍ور؛ تهران، عقیل، سال1382؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9647679776؛ چاپ دوم سال1383؛فهرست: «خانه ریدل»، «زخم»، «دعوت»، «بازگشت به نقب»، «شوخی جادوگرانه ویسلی ها»، «پورتکی»، «بگمن و کروچ»، «جام جهانی کیدیش»، «دارک مارک»، «اغتشاش در وزارتخانه»، «سوار بر قطار هاگوارتز»، «مسابقه سه جادوگر»، «مد - آی مودی»، «طلسم های نابخشودنی»، و ...؛ این داستان «هری پاتر»، در سال چهارم مدرسه‌ است، که پسر «بارتی کراوچ»، نام او را در «جام آتش» می‌اندازد، و در نتیجه، در مسابقات سه جادوگر، شرکت می‌کند، و در آن مسابقه هم، تا بردن در مرحله آخر، موفق می‌شود، ولی، به گورستانی منتقل شده، و موجب بازگشت «لرد ولدمورت» می‌گردد؛ البته پسر «بارتی کراوچ»، با استفاده از معجون مرکب، خود را، به صورت چشم بابا قوری، یکی از دوستان «دامبلدور»، درمی‌آورد، پسر «بارتی کرواچ»، یک مرگ‌خوار بود، و به دستور «لرد ولدمرت»، اسم «هری» را داخل «جام آتش» ریخته بود، تا با استفاده از خون «هری»، «لرد سیاهی»، دوباره توانایی خودش را، بدست آوردتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/11/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 05/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
27,"I remember the first time I read this……I’d just started a real crappy job that I came to hate. I’d dropped out of university after my first year because my degree in psychology was a terrible choice, I seemed to be making more enemies than friends through life, but none of that mattered because I was reading a great series of books. I had something to look forward to every day when I really needed it. The point is books are escapism and fantasy books particularly so. As I got my shit together, this book helped me move on and get through life as so many other books have since. As Harry, Ron and Hermione entered their fourth year of Hogwarts, arguably their most challenging and intense year yet, I checked my mail box to see if my invite had finally arrived. It hadn’t. It still hasn't.Maybe one day. "

“We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.”
The summer is dragging and Harry can't wait to join the Weasleys and Hermione at The Burrow and go with them to the International Quidditch Cup final. It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament, a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. “If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”The introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. “It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”Our trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls 😂. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet. I always associate this book with magical Christmas-sy vibes. It just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series.

29,"4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this.  I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and Cedric Diggory's death. The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner."
30,"Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend’s Ron’s house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore’s age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore’s advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George’s determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine’s growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort’s supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville’s family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn’t resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry’s godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius’ presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry’s journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry’s world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars "
