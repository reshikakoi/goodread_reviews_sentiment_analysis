1,"Don't mind me, just crying my eyes out. This was WAY better than I remember it being, and I remember it being pretty darn good. J.K. Rowling is a writing goddess and I can't believe how much foresight and planning went into this series. She already hints at the horcruxes and many other things in this book that don't show up until much later. Definitely one of my favorites in the series (but I say that about all of them)!"
2,"Um. Wow. Yeah. That was freaking FANTASTIC!!!! Probably my favorite so far, just wow oh my gosh......WHAT EVEN!! I feel empowered and sad at the same time (sad because...you know). 5/5 stars of course! "
3,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: After a steady build, the series hits its stride. Deep and layered, it goes down smooth, never seeming overly complex."
4,One of my favorites in the series.The ending always gets to me and breaks my heart.
5,This series has taken a damn TURN!Watch my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEqu8...
6,"(A) 86% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A tone transfiguration, it's so the boy-girl drama, bright to start, but breaks your heart, and ends in tears and trauma."
7,"*To read more reviews by me visit Views & Reviews *I seriously have no idea why I still review these books when I have nothing new to say. I mean... J.K. Rowling is perfect. This series is perfect. And I dream day & night of going to Hogwarts. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to show you how I felt about this book:When I started the book:During the book:At the end: Umm.. Mam Rowling..All in allSorry for the lame review, readers. I just really don't know what to say.."
8,"I know what you think: Don‚Äôt I have anything to do instead of rereading 750 paged long book on my weekend. Of course I am: I could try to cook breads, cakes, muffins or any other carbs involved project and share at my social media account to risk myself turn into Thor‚Äôs big bellied image at last Avengers movie for consuming them incessantly like my most friends do till the quarantine ends (it will end eventually, right?) Wait a minute, I cannot do that! I can only pose with burned or overcooked things if I insist to cook. I can also resume home soccer matches with my husband dearest but there is nothing left called glass at our place and I am still stressed walking barefoot because there may be still a tiny threatening glass piece hid somewhere waiting for me! And of course: After Ozark, La Casa Da Papel, Tiger King and Unorthodox, I couldn‚Äôt find any appropriate content match with my taste. I‚Äôm already working on three books but on weekends: I‚Äôm suffering from melancholy and I prefer to do something make me happy in the past. ( Like keep watching Shaun of the Dead, Big Lebowski and Fight Club. Interestingly at your each rewatching s√©ance, you‚Äôre catching another detail!) I already told third book is my favorite because it was the last piece that my three musketeers keep their innocence till they take their first steps to the dark side.And this book is the beginning of the dark side. This is the middle part of long installment. A big death will shake them to the cores and everything about their life will change forever. This is one of the darkest, more action packed, gripping, thrilling but also heartbreaking book of the series. When I first read it nearly 20 years ago, I didn‚Äôt get intimidated when I see the page numbers. On contrary I felt blessed because normally I have been finishing a Harry Potter novel in a day (At least I finished the first three books in one day! Correction: First book took me only half day. Thanks to my fast reading technique I improved at college years!)Book‚Äôs longevity was great news. I could spend more time in Harry Potter‚Äôs world!After reading the whirlwind Quidditch Cup competition parts, I adored blooming creativity and visionary scenes written by JKR. I went back to my younger, dumber self and remembered the times how I cherished the chapters, how I thrilled when Harry succeeded and how I flabbergasted after reading the shocking ending.I adored it again and I promised myself to read it another 20 years later. ( I hope I won‚Äôt be at quarantine next time)I recommend you to read the books give you time travel to your happy times at the past so you can handle the daily terrors and find the strength to carry hope into your near future. That‚Äôs why JKR is one of my all time favorite authors!"
9,"There is an incredibly somber mood that descends on me every time I finish this book in the series, and reading it with the illustrations did nothing to change that. I felt the drawings were impeccable, and I loved how some of the characters were reimagined to look a different way than portrayed in the movies, my favorite being Mad Eye Moody. Now, the long wait for the remainder of the illustrated editions. :("
10,Here's some pics from the new Illustrated Edition! I have no idea why this didn't show as being read but who cares. It's Harry Potter and I can reread and listen to them forever!! Mel üñ§üêæüê∫

12,"""I is a good elf""It's been proven three times now, that I always get ahead of myself when reviewing Harry Potter, incorrectly concluding the last one (out of the ones I've read so far) to be the best, but it cannot be helped. The standards are moved up - again. It's like Rowling just had a look at the first books, found them to be way too short, and came up with this one, which is much longer than the previous ones - combined! And the writing style keeps on improving, while plot getting more and more thrilling, making it oh so delightful to read.""Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?""It's great to have that feeling of 'how easy it is to read everything is' still being part of the author's narration. Though the events are being described in much more detail, it does not take away anything in terms of interest. On the contrary, the reader is kept well in suspense, with a number of twists, without making anything too unreal (relative to the world of magic that is). I don't recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one (again, I'm probably getting ahead of myself).""Alf-giant? Moi? I'ave - I'ave big bone!""As far as the environs go, I think it's safe to say that we've arrived at darker times, toward which the third book made way for. Though I loved the first three 'relatively-trouble-free' years, this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening, while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters. And the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much.I don't think I'll be able to rest well until I'm done with the series. I kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years, who had to wait year after year for the next book. Must've felt being under 'Crucio'.""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals."""
13,Ahhh uwielbiam ten tom.
14,"‚ÄúDifferences of habit, language and gender are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.‚Äù- Not J.K.

15,"This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called ""experts"" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don‚Äôt listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn‚Äôt know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already ""been there done that"" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn‚Äôt hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling‚Äôs breezy, ‚Äúear friendly‚Äù prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It‚Äôs high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

Thanks for riding along with me!"
17,"‚ÄúDifferences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.‚ÄùSo this quote kind of sums up what ‚ÄúHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire‚Äù was really about and I think it was cleverly done. ;-) As always there‚Äôs so much to talk about and I decided to continue with another of my ‚ÄúMy thoughts about this book‚Äù reviews. For HP this seems to be the best solution because otherwise I‚Äôd end up writing 5.000 words essays and we all know that 1.) Goodreads won‚Äôt let me post them and 2.) No one would even want to read so much! *lol* So random thoughts it is! 1.) ‚ÄùDeath Eaters?‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúWhat are Death Eaters?‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what You-Know-Who‚Äôs supporters called themselves,‚Äù said Bill.I found it really odd that the term ‚ÄúDeath Eaters‚Äù was mentioned and explained for the very first time in here. I mean Voldemort and his Death Eaters are one of the first things that come to mind when you think about HP. I thought it would have been mentioned in one of the earlier books already, but nope, it really was the first mention. Knowing the Death Eaters will accompany us for the rest of the series this was kind of shocking. XD2.) ‚ÄùI shouted at you before you left!‚Äù Mrs Weasley said, starting to sob. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn‚Äôt get enough O.W.Ls? Oh, Fred... George...‚ÄùMrs. Weasley is legit one of the best moms ever and you can feel her love for all of her kids including Hermione and Harry. So yes, this a Molly Weasley appreciation moment and I still think that she is one of the most underrated characters in the entire series! I love that woman! <33.) ‚ÄùTwitchy little ferret, aren‚Äôt you, Malfoy?‚Äù said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily. Hermione clearly found her self-confidence and poise after ‚ÄúThe Prisoner of Azkaban‚Äù. XD I loved how she always retorted comments that were thrown at her. She‚Äôs so smart it was a pleasure to see her stand up for herself! (and others) And yes, I admit it, just like Ron I wanted to hold the memory of Malfoy the bouncing little ferret in my mind. *lol*4.) ‚ÄùHow are you supposed to defend yourself against something you‚Äôve never seen? A wizard who‚Äôs about to put an illegal curse on you isn‚Äôt going to tell you what he‚Äôs about to do. He‚Äôs not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared.‚ÄùAhh Mad-Eye Moody! As much as I agreed with a lot of the things he said, I also disagreed with a lot of the things he did. Does that even make sense? XD For me Mad-Eye is one of those super morally grey characters because he sometimes does bad things for ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù. Then again his character is consistent too because as an Auror he saw what dark wizards are capable of and he‚Äôs totally right when he says that they won‚Äôt play nice and fair. Guess I‚Äôll always feel conflicted about him. 5.) ‚ÄùNeville, are you all right?‚Äù said Hermione.‚ÄúOh, yes, I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. ‚ÄúVery interesting dinner ‚Äì I mean lesson ‚Äì what‚Äôs for eating?‚ÄùNeville will always break my heart. That poor boy deserved so much better than he got and I‚Äôve such a soft spot for him. He‚Äôs another of those Hogwarts characters I really would have loved to read more about and no matter what people think: He is brave and a true Gryffindor! <36.) Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, ‚ÄúI see no difference.‚ÄùAnd here we have another reason why Snape can‚Äôt be redeemed. He‚Äôs just nasty and mean to his students and a real bully. No matter what happened in his past, he should know better than to let his students suffer for it. I still think that movie Snape is way nicer than book Snape and if you only know book Snape you know why I don‚Äôt like him. I might understand his reasons, but I still hate him. >_<7.) ‚ÄùNext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.‚ÄúD-Dobby?‚Äù Harry gasped.I love Dobby so much! <333 He‚Äôs such an adorable and sweet guy and it was so good to see him so happy! He‚Äôs probably the only house elf that appreciates his freedom but considering his former masters it‚Äôs no wonder he‚Äôs happy to do what he wants. *lol* Guess you‚Äôve to experience the Malfoy‚Äôs as your masters to truly appreciate freedom. ;-P8.) ‚ÄùOh, I see,‚Äù Hermione said, bristling. ‚ÄúSo basically, you‚Äôre going to take the best-looking girl who‚Äôll have you, even if she‚Äôs completely horrible?‚Äù‚ÄúEr ‚Äì yeah, that sounds about right,‚Äù said Ron.*sighs* I usually like Ron but I never liked his ‚ÄúGoblet of Fire‚Äù version and I still don‚Äôt. I mean yes, he‚Äôs a teenage boy who‚Äôs going through puberty but that doesn‚Äôt excuse the many horrible things he does and says in this one. To say it plainly he‚Äôs a total dumbass in GoF and I really don‚Äôt like him. At least in this book. First he doesn‚Äôt believe Harry and then he‚Äôs hurting Hermione whenever he opens his mouth, just because his teenage hormones apparently make it hard to think before he says something. We could blame it on puberty but I think there‚Äôs so much more going on... Luckily Hermione is clever enough to see through it. 9.) ‚ÄùOnly this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.‚ÄùAnd here‚Äôs another breadcrumb that will be relevant in the next book. XD You gotta love how Rowling scatters them in the earlier books and makes use of them later on. ;-)10.) ‚ÄùIf you really want to know, he ‚Äì he said he‚Äôd been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn‚Äôt been able to pluck up the courage!‚ÄùSo after three books we dive right into the teenage drama and angst. Which is kind of suitable for their age but boy, did it impact their friendship in this one. I think from now on there‚Äôs no book in which they don‚Äôt have a conflict of some sort. No matter if it‚Äôs Ron/Harry or Hermione/Ron. There always seems to be something brewing between the trio. And bless Victor Krum for realizing how beautiful Hermione is! If none of the two boys at her side can see it, at least Victor can! I think he knows her value way more than her closest friends and I really appreciate him for it. =)11.) ‚ÄùTrying to ruin someone else‚Äôs life?‚Äù said Harry loudly.Harry giving Rita Skeeter a piece of his mind is one of the best things in this book. That woman is horrible and she‚Äôll only get even worse as the series proceeds. Harry‚Äôs got guts to confront her directly and I just love him for it. 12.) But Sirius shook his head and said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man‚Äôs like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.‚ÄùAnd here‚Äôs another character I‚Äôd love to see more of! Sirius Black is one of the best and I loved how protective he‚Äôs of Harry! He‚Äôs like a lion protecting his pup and I lived and breathed for it. After everything Harry went through he deserves someone who loves him and stands up for him. Even if it‚Äôs against Dumbledore because he wants Harry to rest and feel better instead of recounting events. Sirius placing his hand on Harry‚Äôs shoulder and defending him against Dumbledore‚Äôs questions really made my day! Best guardian ever!13.) ‚ÄùYes,‚Äù said Harry. ‚ÄúProfessor ‚Äì I was in Divination just now, and ‚Äì er ‚Äì I fell asleep.‚ÄùHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, ‚ÄúQuite understandable. Continue.‚ÄùHaha! As much as I disliked Dumbledore forcing Harry to relive that horrible night I still can‚Äôt help but love him for his attitude. He‚Äôs one of the best teachers ever and the fact he didn‚Äôt even bat an eye when Harry told him that he fell asleep in Divination. Priceless! *lol*14.)  ‚ÄùAnd as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason ‚Äì he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort‚Äôs feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible...‚ÄùI LOVE Harry so damn much, I can‚Äôt even! He‚Äôs one hell of a brave boy and I can‚Äôt even imagine how terrified he must have been. Yet he still refused to back down and didn‚Äôt give Voldemort the satisfaction of seeing him cower in front of him. This moment shows the true Gryffindor in him and why he got sorted into the house. When push comes to shove Harry always does the right and noble thing! <3 My precious boy! 15.)  ‚ÄùHarry, you can‚Äôt help him now. It‚Äôs over. Let go.‚Äù‚ÄúHe wanted me to bring him back,‚Äù Harry muttered ‚Äì it seemed important to explain this. ‚ÄúHe wanted me to bring him back to his parents...‚Äù‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, Harry... just let go, now...‚ÄùThis moment always makes me cry! Cedric Diggory‚Äôs death is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in this series and it will always break my heart. No matter how often I read it, it‚Äôs still devastating. And Harry‚Äôs reaction to it, knowing that he could have been alive if he would have touched that portkey without him... It‚Äôs the first time that he has to live with the death of someone he knew and liked and it‚Äôs even worse because he feels guilty. What if he would have done the egoistic thing and won the tournament? What if he wouldn‚Äôt have offered Cedric to win together? For the first time ever his sense of fairness and his honour brought death to someone and his feelings are so complex I could cry. He did the right thing but it ended badly and left him devastated. If that‚Äôs not the symbolical embodiment of growing up then I don‚Äôt know.16.)  Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.‚ÄúCome along, Potter,‚Äù she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. ‚ÄúCome along... hospital wing...‚ÄùTo see McGonagall show so much emotion about broke me. This woman is always so composed and knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing but for the first time ever she can‚Äôt seem to be able to ignore her own feelings. She cares about Harry deeply and it never showed as much as after Cedric‚Äôs death. Such a great and beautiful scene! 17.)  ‚ÄùFail to act ‚Äì and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!‚Äù Well, and that‚Äôs about exactly what happens. Fudge didn‚Äôt take Harry‚Äôs story seriously and the wizarding world had to pay the price for his ignorance. It‚Äôs kind of eerie how Rowling captured politics and how the fact that they work so slowly is standing in their own way. At first Fudge didn‚Äôt react and once he did, it was too slow to make a difference. He kind of dug his own grave with his actions at the end of GoF and history will indeed remember him as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort to take a second shot at power.  ‚ÄúThe Order of the Phoenix‚Äù is up next and it‚Äôs the last book I have to borrow from the library because I actually have book 6 and 7 in English at home. =) So let‚Äôs hope I‚Äôll be able to borrow book 5 soon. ____________________________________I always forget how serious those books become.‚ÄúThe Prisoner of Azkaban‚Äù was already very dark but I think ‚ÄúThe Goblet of Fire‚Äù stepped it up a notch. The ending will always get me, no matter how old I am. >_<Full RTC soon! Stay tuned!P.S: I borrowed this twice from my library. *lol* That‚Äôs how I was able to continue. Thankfully they have a lot of copies of HP! XD____________________________________I just borrowed this from my library but of course someone else already preordered it again. >_<So I guess that means I‚Äôll have to be fast and start now!617 pages with a super tiny font. I CAN DO THIS!!!Or well, at least I hope I can. *lol*Regardless of everything I just said ‚ÄúThe Goblet of Fire‚Äù has always been one of my favourite HP books. I‚Äôm curious if I‚Äôll feel the same way after rereading it now. Which HP book is your favourite and why? =)"
18,"Complete 5 Golden Starsone of my favouritesall the thrills, mysteries, the competition, more lovely characters. (some more jerks too that I wanted to hit their heads at the wall)THAT ENDING!Now I'm writing this, after many times re-read, I exactly remembered my first reaction after finishing this book, after that horror in the end of the book, I was awestruck; ""WHY THIS BOOK IS OVER!? give me more!"" & then there was no book 5, you see the pain? after the biggest plot twists of the series (which I was looking forward to it so much) I had to wait!Harry Potter series was my first in many things; my first novel, my first fantasy, my first book crush, & one of them was my first Cliffhanger!this book is the point that the world started to getting Darker & a little out of mere-middle-grade-ish part. not that previous books were childish, but they're fun & cute & the protagonists are younger; suitable for both kids & young readers, but now things getting more serious & dark.I love how Rowling's slowly revealing the wizarding world's secrets to us, each book has something new about the world. we have time to process the interesting new info & remember it later. (the complete opposite of info-dump) & I believe it's a talent.& here it's about the first war & You know who's followers & rituals.We're also about to see the Quidditch World Cup (Fudge was so funny here!) & getting more information about the magical educations around the world.the plot; we knew something were off, but we can't exactly pinpointed it until the end when the truth revealed. Rowling knows how to reveal a plot twist in the most shocking way. (she actually proved it a few times in book 1, 2 & 3! but still surprising how brilliant it is.)Harry's suddenly in trouble & he doesn't know how.I like Krum.& all the predicaments the Trio should struggle through made by Rita Skeeter, bullies & the mean students, but they didn't cower or hide, they held their head high & ignoring them.I always loved villains in disguises, they are interesting & cunning & we can't tell until they revealed their secrets. the feel of bewildered betrayal the hero going through.the writing style is fun as always, comparing to book one, it has improved a lot, now it's graceful & rich.the villain's chapter was the best villain-ish/not-Harry-related POV in the whole series; intriguing & spooky.the movie was good, but didn't do the justice toward the book, it felt so rushed & deleted many parts of the book.I would've liked to see the Quidditch World cup Final match on the screen, the real ""interesting"" 3rd task & the Sphinx, the hilarious scenes by Ludo, Dobby, Winky & her story or showing the stubborn stupid refusal of that gargoyle to accept the truth & the cleavage in the society in the end.& while fans are angry about ""Dumbledore asked calmly"" part that turned out the total opposite in the movie (& I totally LAUGHED at that part everytime I reach that moment in either the book or the movie), I'm MAD at how movie Harry acted out-of-character in one scene in the movie (just because increasing the thrills I suppose) when he did exactly the opposite in the book."

‚ÄúHe had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs Weasley held him to her. His mother‚Äôs face, his father‚Äôs voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground, all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.‚Äù
* My heart broke for Harry several times. The childhood traumas he‚Äôs suffered are too much, too unfair. * Dumbledore will always remain the baddest son of a bitch. The end of these books remain pure gold because of him. * Cornelius Fudge represents Trump nicely in this book. * Am I the only one that still doesn‚Äôt hate Snape? My guy has been living a double life his whole life. Still a dick, but you know, a redeemable one. * Hermoine figuring out Rita Skeeter‚Äôs secret was a proud moment. * I love that Harry gave the Weasley Twins his winnings!

22,"‚ÄúThe truth is generally preferable to lies.‚Äù-Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireJK Rowling knows how to write highly readable text. She specializes in short, highly digestible paragraphs. The pages flow pretty quickly.She also elevates the problems of Harry Potter from just one boy to good versus evil.However, this book was too long. I wish that Rowling shortened the book, cutting out Rita Skeeter, Quidditch, and The Yule Ball. She could have easily sold these bits of Harry Potter as short stories.

25,My long time favourite. And the long mistreatment of Fleur in this series just begun.
26,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter #4), J.K. RowlingHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series, written by British author J. K. Rowling. It follows Harry Potter, a wizard in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the mystery surrounding the entry of Harry's name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete. Definitely one of my favorites in the series.The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive!ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™€åŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥: ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™ ŸÖÿßŸá ÿ¢⁄ØŸàÿ≥ÿ™ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ2001ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿáÿ±€å Ÿæÿßÿ™ÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ¥ÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿ¨€å ⁄©€å ÿ±ŸàŸÑ€åŸÜ⁄Øÿõ ÿ®ÿ±⁄Øÿ±ÿØÿßŸÜÿå Ÿà€åÿØÿß ÿßÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ€åŸáÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ™ŸÜÿØ€åÿ≥ÿõ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1382ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿßŸàŸÑ Ÿà ÿØŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1379ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ®€åÿ≥ÿ™ Ÿà ŸáŸÅÿ™ÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1396ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ≥€å Ÿà ÿ≥ŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1399ÿõ ÿØÿ±414ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©9789645757050 ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±€åÿ™ÿßŸÜ€åÿß - ÿ≥ÿØŸá 21ŸÖÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: ¬´Ÿáÿ±€å Ÿæÿßÿ™ÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ¥¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿ®ÿß ÿ®ÿ±⁄Øÿ±ÿØÿßŸÜ: ŸÖŸáÿØ€å ŸÇÿ±ÿß⁄ÜŸá ÿØÿßÿ∫€åÿå Ÿà ÿ¥€åÿ±€åŸÜ ŸÑÿßÿ±ŸàÿØ€å (ÿßŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ¥€å)ÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ∞ŸáŸÜ ÿ¢Ÿà€åÿ≤ ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1379Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€å ÿØÿ±567ÿµÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1380ÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©964920691ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨‚ÄçÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥ÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ÿ¨‚Äå.⁄© ÿ±ŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äåÿõ ÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚ÄçŸá‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿ±ÿ™‚ÄçŸà ÿßÿ¥‚Äçÿ±ÿßŸÇ‚Äåÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÜÿßŸá€åÿØÿå ÿ¨ÿßÿ±ÿõ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1380ÿõ ÿØÿ± ÿØŸà ÿ¨ŸÑÿØÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá ÿØŸà ÿ¨ŸÑÿØ€å9646205291ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1380ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ≥ŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1381ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ⁄ÜŸáÿßÿ±ŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1382ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ŸæŸÜÿ¨ŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1386ÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©9789646205307ÿõ ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨‚ÄçÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥‚Äåÿõ ŸÜ‚ÄçŸàÿ¥‚Äçÿ™‚ÄçŸá‚Äå ÿ¨‚Äç€å‚Äå.⁄©‚Äç€å ÿ±ŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äå‚Äè‚Ä´ÿõ ŸÖÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äå ŸÖ‚Äçÿ≠‚ÄçŸÖ‚ÄçÿØ ŸÇ‚Äçÿµ‚Äçÿßÿπ‚Äåÿõ ÿ™‚ÄçŸá‚Äçÿ±ÿßŸÜ‚Äå: ŸÖ‚ÄçŸàÿ≥‚Äçÿ≥‚ÄçŸá‚Äå ŸÅ‚Äçÿ±Ÿá‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äç€å‚Äå Ÿà Ÿá‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå ÿ¢€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚ÄçÿØŸá‚Äå‚ÄåŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äçÿßÿ±ÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1380ÿõ ÿØÿ±820ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©649270736ÿõÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨‚ÄçÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥ÿõ ÿ¨‚Äç€å‚Äå.⁄©‚Äç€å‚Äå ÿ±ŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äåÿõ ŸÖÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äå ŸÅ‚Äçÿ±€å‚ÄçÿØŸàŸÜ‚Äå ŸÇ‚Äçÿßÿ∂‚Äç€å‚ÄåŸÜ‚Äç⁄òÿßÿØ‚Äè‚Ä´ÿõ Ÿà€å‚Äçÿ±ÿß€å‚Äçÿ¥‚Äå ŸÜ‚Äçÿ≥‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äå ÿπ‚Äçÿ≤€å‚Äçÿ≤€å‚Äåÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤⁄Øÿßÿ±ÿå ÿ¨ŸàÿßŸÜÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1381ÿõ ÿØÿ± ÿØŸà ÿ¨ŸÑÿØÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá9649306196ÿõÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨‚ÄçÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥‚Äåÿõ ŸÜ‚ÄçŸà€å‚Äçÿ≥‚ÄçŸÜ‚ÄçÿØŸá‚Äå ÿ¨‚Äå.⁄© ÿ±ŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äåÿõ ŸÖ‚Äçÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äå ŸÖ‚Äçÿ±ÿ™‚Äçÿ∂‚Äç€å‚Äå ŸÖ‚ÄçÿØŸÜ‚Äç€å‚ÄåŸÜ‚Äç⁄òÿßÿØ‚Äè‚Ä´ÿõ Ÿà€å‚Äçÿ±ÿßÿ≥‚Äçÿ™‚Äçÿßÿ± ŸÖ‚ÄçŸÑ‚Äç⁄©‚Äåÿ≥‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äçÿß ÿ∑ÿßŸá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äåÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå Ÿá€åÿ±ŸÖŸÜÿØÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1381ÿõ ÿØÿ± ÿØŸà ÿ¨ŸÑÿØÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá9646974546ÿõÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äå Ÿæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨‚ÄçÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥‚Äåÿõ ÿ¨‚Äç€å‚Äå ⁄©‚Äç€å‚Äå ÿ±ŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äå‚Äè‚Ä´ÿõ ÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚ÄçŸá‚Äå ÿßŸÖ‚Äç€å‚Äçÿ±ÿ¥‚ÄçŸá‚Äçÿ±€å‚Äçÿßÿ± ÿßŸÖ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç€å‚ÄçÿßŸÜ‚Äåÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÖŸáÿ±ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÖ€åŸÜÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1382ÿõ ÿØÿ±560ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©9649434615ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿ™‚ÄçŸá‚Äçÿ±ÿßŸÜ‚Äå: ŸÖ‚ÄçŸàÿ≥‚Äçÿ≥‚ÄçŸá‚Äå ŸÅ‚Äçÿ±Ÿá‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äç€å‚Äåÿå ÿßŸÜ‚Äçÿ™‚Äçÿ¥‚Äçÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™‚Äç€å‚Äå ÿ¢ŸÅ‚Äçÿ±€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚ÄçŸá‚Äåÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1379ÿõ ÿØÿ±650ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©9646191592ÿõÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: Ÿá‚Äçÿ±€å ‚Äå‚ÄåŸæ‚Äçÿßÿ™‚Äçÿ± Ÿà ÿ¨ÔøΩÔøΩÿßŸÖ‚Äå ÿ¢ÿ™‚Äçÿ¥‚Äåÿõ ŸÜ‚ÄçŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá‚Äå ÿ¨‚Äç€å‚Äå⁄©‚Äç€å‚Äå ÿßŸàŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸÜ‚Äç⁄Ø‚Äå‚Äè‚Ä´ÿõ ŸÖ‚Äçÿ™‚Äçÿ±ÿ¨‚ÄçŸÖ‚Äå ÿß€å‚Äçÿ±ŸÜ‚Äå ÿπ‚ÄçŸÑ‚Äç€å‚ÄçŸæ‚ÄçŸàÿ±ÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ÿπŸÇ€åŸÑÿå ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1382ÿõ ÿØÿ± ÿØŸà ÿ¨ŸÑÿØÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄© ÿØŸàÿ±Ÿá9647679776ÿõ ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿØŸàŸÖ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ1383ÿõŸÅŸáÿ±ÿ≥ÿ™: ¬´ÿÆÿßŸÜŸá ÿ±€åÿØŸÑ¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ≤ÿÆŸÖ¬ªÿå ¬´ÿØÿπŸàÿ™¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ®ÿßÿ≤⁄Øÿ¥ÿ™ ÿ®Ÿá ŸÜŸÇÿ®¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ¥ŸàÿÆ€å ÿ¨ÿßÿØŸà⁄Øÿ±ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿà€åÿ≥ŸÑ€å Ÿáÿß¬ªÿå ¬´ŸæŸàÿ±ÿ™⁄©€å¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ®⁄ØŸÖŸÜ Ÿà ⁄©ÿ±Ÿà⁄Ü¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ÿ¨ŸáÿßŸÜ€å ⁄©€åÿØ€åÿ¥¬ªÿå ¬´ÿØÿßÿ±⁄© ŸÖÿßÿ±⁄©¬ªÿå ¬´ÿßÿ∫ÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ¥ ÿØÿ± Ÿàÿ≤ÿßÿ±ÿ™ÿÆÿßŸÜŸá¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ≥Ÿàÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿ± ŸÇÿ∑ÿßÿ± Ÿáÿß⁄ØŸàÿßÿ±ÿ™ÿ≤¬ªÿå ¬´ŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ®ŸÇŸá ÿ≥Ÿá ÿ¨ÿßÿØŸà⁄Øÿ±¬ªÿå ¬´ŸÖÿØ - ÿ¢€å ŸÖŸàÿØ€å¬ªÿå ¬´ÿ∑ŸÑÿ≥ŸÖ Ÿáÿß€å ŸÜÿßÿ®ÿÆÿ¥ŸàÿØŸÜ€å¬ªÿå Ÿà ...ÿõ ÿß€åŸÜ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ¬´Ÿáÿ±€å Ÿæÿßÿ™ÿ±¬ªÿå ÿØÿ± ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ ⁄ÜŸáÿßÿ±ŸÖ ŸÖÿØÿ±ÿ≥Ÿá‚Äå ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿå ⁄©Ÿá Ÿæÿ≥ÿ± ¬´ÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿ™€å ⁄©ÿ±ÿßŸà⁄Ü¬ªÿå ŸÜÿßŸÖ ÿßŸà ÿ±ÿß ÿØÿ± ¬´ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ¥¬ª ŸÖ€å‚ÄåÿßŸÜÿØÿßÿ≤ÿØÿå Ÿà ÿØÿ± ŸÜÿ™€åÿ¨Ÿáÿå ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ®ŸÇÿßÿ™ ÿ≥Ÿá ÿ¨ÿßÿØŸà⁄Øÿ±ÿå ÿ¥ÿ±⁄©ÿ™ ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄©ŸÜÿØÿå Ÿà ÿØÿ± ÿ¢ŸÜ ŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ®ŸÇŸá ŸáŸÖÿå ÿ™ÿß ÿ®ÿ±ÿØŸÜ ÿØÿ± ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑŸá ÿ¢ÿÆÿ±ÿå ŸÖŸàŸÅŸÇ ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ¥ŸàÿØÿå ŸàŸÑ€åÿå ÿ®Ÿá ⁄ØŸàÿ±ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ€å ŸÖŸÜÿ™ŸÇŸÑ ÿ¥ÿØŸáÿå Ÿà ŸÖŸàÿ¨ÿ® ÿ®ÿßÿ≤⁄Øÿ¥ÿ™ ¬´ŸÑÿ±ÿØ ŸàŸÑÿØŸÖŸàÿ±ÿ™¬ª ŸÖ€å‚Äå⁄Øÿ±ÿØÿØÿõ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ™Ÿá Ÿæÿ≥ÿ± ¬´ÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿ™€å ⁄©ÿ±ÿßŸà⁄Ü¬ªÿå ÿ®ÿß ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÅÿßÿØŸá ÿßÿ≤ ŸÖÿπÿ¨ŸàŸÜ ŸÖÿ±⁄©ÿ®ÿå ÿÆŸàÿØ ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿ®Ÿá ÿµŸàÿ±ÿ™ ⁄Üÿ¥ŸÖ ÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß ŸÇŸàÿ±€åÿå €å⁄©€å ÿßÿ≤ ÿØŸàÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ¬´ÿØÿßŸÖÿ®ŸÑÿØŸàÿ±¬ªÿå ÿØÿ±ŸÖ€å‚Äåÿ¢Ÿàÿ±ÿØÿå Ÿæÿ≥ÿ± ¬´ÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿ™€å ⁄©ÿ±Ÿàÿß⁄Ü¬ªÿå €å⁄© ŸÖÿ±⁄Ø‚ÄåÿÆŸàÿßÿ± ÿ®ŸàÿØÿå Ÿà ÿ®Ÿá ÿØÿ≥ÿ™Ÿàÿ± ¬´ŸÑÿ±ÿØ ŸàŸÑÿØŸÖÿ±ÿ™¬ªÿå ÿßÿ≥ŸÖ ¬´Ÿáÿ±€å¬ª ÿ±ÿß ÿØÿßÿÆŸÑ ¬´ÿ¨ÿßŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ™ÿ¥¬ª ÿ±€åÿÆÿ™Ÿá ÿ®ŸàÿØÿå ÿ™ÿß ÿ®ÿß ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸÅÿßÿØŸá ÿßÿ≤ ÿÆŸàŸÜ ¬´Ÿáÿ±€å¬ªÿå ¬´ŸÑÿ±ÿØ ÿ≥€åÿßŸá€å¬ªÿå ÿØŸàÿ®ÿßÿ±Ÿá ÿ™ŸàÿßŸÜÿß€å€å ÿÆŸàÿØÿ¥ ÿ±ÿßÿå ÿ®ÿØÿ≥ÿ™ ÿ¢Ÿàÿ±ÿØÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿ®ŸáŸÜ⁄ØÿßŸÖ ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€å 19/11/1399Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ 05/08/1400Ÿáÿ¨ÿ±€å ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØ€åÿõ ÿß. ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®€åÿßŸÜ€å"
27,"I remember the first time I read this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I‚Äôd just started a real crappy job that I came to hate. I‚Äôd dropped out of university after my first year because my degree in psychology was a terrible choice, I seemed to be making more enemies than friends through life, but none of that mattered because I was reading a great series of books. I had something to look forward to every day when I really needed it. The point is books are escapism and fantasy books particularly so. As I got my shit together, this book helped me move on and get through life as so many other books have since. As Harry, Ron and Hermione entered their fourth year of Hogwarts, arguably their most challenging and intense year yet, I checked my mail box to see if my invite had finally arrived. It hadn‚Äôt. It still hasn't.Maybe one day. "

‚ÄúWe are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.‚Äù
The summer is dragging and Harry can't wait to join the Weasleys and Hermione at The Burrow and go with them to the International Quidditch Cup final. It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament, a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. ‚ÄúIf you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.‚ÄùThe introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. ‚ÄúIt matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.‚ÄùOur trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls üòÇ. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet. I always associate this book with magical Christmas-sy vibes. It just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series.

29,"4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this.  I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and Cedric Diggory's death. The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner."
30,"Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend‚Äôs Ron‚Äôs house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore‚Äôs age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore‚Äôs advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George‚Äôs determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine‚Äôs growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort‚Äôs supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville‚Äôs family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn‚Äôt resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry‚Äôs godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius‚Äô presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry‚Äôs journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry‚Äôs world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars "
