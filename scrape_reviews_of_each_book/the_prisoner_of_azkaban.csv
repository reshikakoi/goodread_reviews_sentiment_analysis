1,This is a Weasley appreciation post.
2,I am both pleasantly surprised and mad that I ended up enjoying this audiobook and getting invested in Sirius Black. The story really improved when we discovered more about the background story of events that happened before Harry's generation. I enjoyed learning more about the adult characters and being surprised at the plot developments. 
3,“Don't let the muggles get you down.” Yup yup yup I love this book.
4,"(A) 85% | ExtraordinaryNotes: Separating itself from its forebears, it's a story of greater complexity, darker tones, and a vastly expanded mythology."
5,I'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher.
6,This one is definitely my favourite of the 3 i've read so far.. :)(Watch my review here): https://youtu.be/gFZ99uPXiIU
7,"I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it. Despite the fact that I gave this book 5 stars previously, I have to admit that it didn't grow on me until this, my second read. Confession time: I didn't like Remus or Sirius.*Khanh ducks as rotten fruit and eggs are thrown her way*OK, OK, I'M SORRY! I've since changed my mind! Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters"
8,"(A) 85% | ExtraordinaryNotes: A flavorful foreboding, it plies expanded bandwidth, like ripened fruit, and more acute: a sweet and spicy sandwich.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary: Progress updates:02/13/2020 - PreambleOf all the books, most people say this one's their favorite. I believe a big reason why is it hits the sweet-spot between the middle-grade fare of the first two and the dark seriousness of the last four. On the whole, I enjoyed the last four more, as serial installments of the ""Voldemort is back"" storyline. But of the standalone books, I like this best.02/14/2020 - 4%(1) Hedwig flew all the way to France, assuming Hermione would have a gift for Harry. A bit presumptuous.(2) Hermione's letter: ""Dear Harry, Ron wrote to me ... Did you see that picture of Ron and his family ... Ron says he's going to be in London ... Ron says Percy's Head Boy ... Ron doesn't seem too happy.""- Ron, Ron, Ron. It's all about Ron.02/15/2020 - 7%(1) ""Ron Weasley ... came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn't, but had never used a telephone before.""- Filmmakers should've taken note... not so much the telephone part.(2) Everyone's weirdly casual about the fact that Harry's punished with beatings. Likely entirely acceptable in the early '90s.02/16/2020 - 12%(1) ""Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other).""- Well, wizards use wooden wands to kill each other too.(2) Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit.""- Trousers? Suit? Fudge enjoys muggle clothes, I see.02/17/2020 - 15%(1) Hermione takes Muggle Studies. Which, while not cheating, is a lot like taking a language you're fluent in.(2) '[Hermione's] arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.""You bought that monster?"" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.""He's gorgeous, isn't he?"" said Hermione, glowing.'- Well, Hermione does have a thing for gingers.02/18/2020 - 18%(1) When arguing about Harry's safety, it's Arthur who insists on extra precautions, while Molly believes Dumbledore knows what's best. I'd have thought it'd be opposite.(2) ""Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally Harry.""- I wonder if Molly ever treated her kids' other friends this way. Possibly, she's seen the future.02/19/2020 - 27%(1) ""Crabbe and Goyle seemed to exist to do Malfoy's bidding.""- That's quite the meta statement.(2) '[Professor Trelawney] shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, ""beware a red-haired man."" Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him.'- Hmm, it'd be a much better omen for Padma, Ron’s Yule Ball date.02/20/2020 - 30%(1) Pansy Parkinson is totally Malfoy's Lavender Brown. Unlike Ron, Malfoy's content to string her along.(2) Malfoy calls Buckbeak ugly, provoking an attack. Wonder if hippogriffs understand English or are just sensitive to tone.(3) Ron's surprisingly proficient at potions, at least where knifework is concerned. His roots are ""beautifully cut.""02/21/2020 - 34%(1) Parvati's greatest fear is mummies. I'd assume they'd only be a real threat in Egypt. Though, perhaps she was menaced by one brought over for Victorian unwrapping parties.(2) Lupin and the Marauders mocked Snape as students. Lupin encourages Neville to mock Snape in effigy. Snape bullies Neville more than ever. Not right, but it makes sense.02/22/2020 - 37%(1) Crookshanks kills a spider, and eats it in front of Ron. Then goes to kill Scabbers: taking out all Ron's natural enemies.(2) ""Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room, pink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.""- See, who said Ron and Hermione can't get along, just the two of them?02/23/2020 - 41%(1) The Hufflepuff quidditch team's secret weapon is Cedric Diggory... who makes all the female Griffindor players giggle and swoon.(2) Snape calls Hermione an ""insufferable know-it-all."" Ron yells at Snape and gets detention... only Ron gets to call her that ;)(3) Snape makes Lupin's class study werewolves... because he's such a troll.02/24/2020 - 45%(1) Lupin: ""Don't worry. I'll speak to Professor Snape. You don't have to do the [werewolf] essay.""""Oh no,"" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. ""I've already finished it!""- This is why I procrastinate.(2) Trips to Hogsmede essentially serve as bonding-time for Ron and Hermione. Or at the very least, a ceasefire during their pet conflict.02/25/2020 - 49%(1) Ron has a crush on Madame Rosmerta, which the book only hints at. In the film Hermione teases him about it.(2) In the book Harry finds Ron and Hermione in Honeydukes. In the film they're by themselves in a secluded wood:Hermione: ""Do you want to move a bit closer?""Ron: ""Huh?""Hermione: ""To the Shrieking Shack.""Ron: ""Oh no. I'm fine here.""02/26/2020 - 55%(1) For someone who scolds others for breaking rules, Hermione's awful cavalier about entering the boys' dormitory.(2) '""When thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!""... Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen.""Tripe, Sibyll?""Professor Trelawney ignored her.'- McGonagall with the sly diss!02/27/2020 - 58%(1) I'd imagine butterbeer must taste something like a cross between butterscotch and root beer.(2) Dementors drain happiness. The remedy for a dementor attack is chocolate. Ergo, chocolate equals happiness.(3) Hermione's favorite subject is arithmancy. I'd never have taken her for a numbers person. But then, math is the opposite of divination.02/28/2020 - 62%(1) Cho is to Harry as Cedric is to the Gryffindor girls. Eyes on the snitch, Harry! Not the girl!(2) Harry is to the Firebolt as Jon Snow is to Longclaw.(3) '""Penelope and I have got a bet on,"" [Percy] told the team. ""Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!""- Yes, because making your girlfriend pay you money is always a good idea. *eye-roll02/29/2020 - 64%(1) Hermione: ""Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I'll tell Professor McGonagall about [the Marauder's] map!""- Oh, Hermione. Always resorting to blackmail. Like getting Harry's broom confiscated worked so well.(2) Hagrid: ""Really upset, [Hermione] was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron.""- Never confide in Hagrid, he always spills beans!03/01/2020 - 66%(1) Ron to invisible Harry: '""Where are you? ... Are you still there? This feels weird!""'- ""Weird"" seems to be Ron's catchphrase, as in ""Weird! What a shape! This is money?"" or “So that’s a house-elf? ... Weird things, aren’t they?”(2) ""Harry tried to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands.""- Blame it on herbology!03/02/2020 - 68%(1) '""Oh, Ron!"" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away.'- Ron's not used to being hugged, I guess. Pats go on the back.(2) Ron totally gets turned on by Hermione punching Malfoy. She should've done it sooner!03/03/2020 - 70%(1) Hermione quits divination... which fulfills the prophesy of the lost pupil!(2) Trelawney: ""Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?""Ron: ""I don't need help ... There's going to be loads of fog tonight.""(3) For a supposed charlatan, Trelawney's remarkably accurate with her omens... albeit imprecise.03/04/2020 - 73%(1) Co-ed changing rooms seem like a recipe for disaster.(2) Penalty shots in quidditch are never adequately explained or described. Is it soccer-style, where the shot's taken from a fixed position? Or is it hockey-style, where the player moves toward the goalkeeper?(3) Apparently, wizarding trials involve a judge, jury, and executioner.03/05/2020 - 75%(1) Apparently, Ron has giant feet. Could well call him Ronald McDonald instead of Ronald Weasley.(2) Like Neville, Hermione's boggart is also a teacher. It's McGonagall saying she's failed everything. Unlike Neville, she fails to find the humor in it.(3) Hermione blushes when Ron compliments her rule-breaking. Weird what passes for sweet-talk.03/06/2020 - 77%(1) I'm getting a definite ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" vibe at the scene where the Grim pulls Ron below ground.(2) At the execution scene, both Harry and Hermione fall to pieces. Surprisingly, it's Ron that's the pillar of strength.(3) The tunnel at the base of the Whomping Willow goes off the Marauder's Map. It's literally uncharted territory.03/07/2020 - 79%(1) ""'If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!' [Ron] said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.""- Another estimable Ron line/act given to Hermione in the film.(2) Knowing how the book plays out takes all the edge out of seeing Sirius as a villain.03/08/2020 - 82%(1) Lupin seeing Peter on the Marauder's Map is a spit-take I want to see!(2) Hermione's awfully naive, assuming every Animagi voluntarily registers with the Ministry. But then, she's new to rule-breaking.(3) I heard J.K. Rowling say once that being a werewolf was akin to living with AIDS. Really makes you read Lupin's origin story differently.03/09/2020 - 87%(1) ""Bandages spun up Ron's leg, strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn't wince.""- Far cry from the film, where Ron's a whimpering wreck. Though, I did get a kick out of film-Ron milking his injuries to bait care and attention from Hermione. Book-Ron would never be so bold!03/10/2020 - 91%(1) Ron's in the hospital, leaving Harry and Hermione to save the day. It was the other way around last book, which is an interesting bit of mirroring.(2) ""[Madam Pomfrey] was carrying the largest block of chocolate [Harry] had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.""- I have a feeling medicinal chocolate may not taste so great.03/11/2020 - 94%(1) ""From what Harry could see of Hermione's face, she looked terrified.""- One major aspect of Hermione lost in the films is how terrified she is all the time. She gets braver each book. It's called character development!(2) Harry bows to Buckbeak before leading him away. Who says you never learn anything practical in Care of Magical Creatures?03/12/2020 - 96%(1) Hermione: ""Harry, I can't believe it... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those Dementors! That's very, very advanced magic.""Harry: ""I knew I could do it this time because I'd already done it... Does that make sense?""Hermione: ""I don't know.""- It's a chicken and egg paradox... where did the confidence come from to begin with?!03/13/2020 - 98%(1) '""[Sirius Black] didn't disapparate!"" Snape roared, now very close at hand. ""You can't apparate or disapparate inside this castle! This–has–something–to–do–with–Potter! ... They helped him escape, I know it!""'- Well, Snape's right about that.(2) Must get to writing my review. How does one distill Harry Potter in a sentence? It's never easy."
9,I have so much more love for this one re-reading it as an adult. Five stars of course. 
10,"This home prison a.k.a voluntarily quarantine making cookies and throwing them into trash days( I never say I’m a good cook and each day I’m getting worse!) giving me nostalgic vibes. It’s like living never ending mercury retrograde! You don’t want to start a new thing, you have to go back to your past or you have to deal with your unfinished businesses.  Of course this is not a book from my TBR or DNF list. I’ve read it very same day it has been released: 16 freaking years ago when I was still hot, dump, in my silly 20’s . The year I finished it, I flipped my bird to my managers at the workplace and quitted for chasing my writing dreams. (It was not entertaining, sunshine and rainbow story, there is so much rebellion, pain, fight, humiliation but freedom never comes without dues to pay!) And after devouring this book in one day( because I locked myself at my childhood room. Yes, I was single! It was easier to isolate yourself!) and I decided that’s my all time favorite Harry Potter book (I know there were more to come but my life was changing and my three musketeers’ lives were also going different directions. They were finally growing up, just like me!)  Sirius Black has a special place in my heart and at the beginning he escaped from Azkaban and we think he was after Harry to kill him. This book faces Harry’s past trauma about his family, his guilt feelings, night terror, his self insecurities and sometimes we think his inner demons were more terrifying than the outside world’s vicious, dangerous avengers coming after him. And at the end, Harry and Sirius’s special relationship always melts my heart and fills my eyes in tears. I always find this is one of the most meaningful and genuine relationships JKR formed between two characters.  And we also see the growing pains of two main characters: Ron always loyal, likable, witty and Hermione is passionate, intelligent but also kind-hearted. Maybe this is the best part of their story because after this book, everything gets bleaker, darker and more violent! My dear three musketeers’ lives will never be the same. I read this book 16 years by locking myself in my room and as a de je vu or reenactment of my younger and dumber self, I reread my favorite HP book. I smiled, entertained, cried, jumped, horrified again! And I felt good and gave my five gazillion stars over and over again! In these days, the best thing you gotta do: sticking with the things that makes you happy and rekindle your past experiments by making a visit to your memory lane with a great book!That’s what I did and it worked so well with me!"

12,"It's a rainy Sunday. It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” 

I was 16 years old, and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations. My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter. (Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). Before I tell you about my experience, I need to make a confession. It was my choice to stay away from J.K. Rowling's books until that moment. I wanted to swim against the current, and I thought that Harry Potter was too ""mainstream"" for my taste. And the foolish little me was proud of this decision. But when my teacher gave me this old, used copy, something inside me cracked. I knew the basics about the story, about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly, evil dude who doesn't have a nose. But page by page, I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn't want to offers more than that; he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently. I stayed up late at night, with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences, and I cheered for Gryffindor's Quidditch team, I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to Pottermore it's a brown mastiff, which is oddly fitting). I casted spells (but never Avada Kedavra, you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and just like that, my life had changed irrevocably. I was a Potterhead. And I was proud of that. (my mum wasn't though, especially when I asked for a wand).

“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

There is a reason why J.K. Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide. Friendship, love, hope, they're present in her books even in the most desperate times, when Evil seems undefeatable, when no escape is visible. She encourages and empowers, shows that everything is possible, that strength and courage can be found within, when you have someone to hold your hand. Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving, it took him years but he finally found a place to belong, to feel safe and cared. Ron, with his witty lines and his constant presence, Hermione, my personal favorite, with her intelligence and compassion, they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart, and even now, years later, I'm still under their spell. I think I will always be.

“Don't let the muggles get you down.”

I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter, and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame. I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books (meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half) and laugh at Harry Potter jokes. And I know, and it's imprinted in my soul, that I'll never be a muggle again."
13,"“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”As it seems my Harry Potter reviews don’t always start with a Dumbledore quote but always end up being “My thoughts about this book” reviews as well. For a series like HP that’s been read by so many people this might be the best solution though. And because the books get longer and longer and because I don’t share my friend Jayson’s amazing and remarkable ability to describe a book in one significant sentence, I’m afraid you’ll have to bear with quite a lot of my thoughts. *lol*1.) ”It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all the time with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup-“Aunt Marge is such a horrible person!!! If you ask me she’s really lucky that Harry is such a precious cinnamon roll and only made her a big bubble gum. *lol* The audacity to talk about his dead parents like that! No wonder Harry got so angry!! Aunt Marge can float to hell! 2.) ”I’ve already had some,” said Harry. “Professor Lupin gave me some. He gave it to all of us.”“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.”Lupin is the best DADA teacher they ever had and I love him so much! <333 His character is just great and I wish we would have seen even more of him. Unfortunately we weren’t blessed with all too many Lupin scenes. >_<3.) ”How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers… the resemblance between you is uncanny.”And speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst! Snape is such a horrible teacher I can’t even! I said it once and I’ll say it again: He's cruel, he's a bully, he takes delight in instilling fear in his students. And he verbally and emotionally abuses them. His personal vendetta against Harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy! Movie Snape is way nicer than the one in the books and I'm sorry but if you ask me #SnapeCan'tBeRedeemed""!!4.) ”They’ve got a new captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory-“Angelina, Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled.“What?” said Wood, frowning at this light-hearted behaviour.“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.It’s the third book and Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang are already mentioned! Also did anyone notice that they are both introduced as Seekers as well? ;-) So we have all the main players for book 4! Harry, Draco, Cho and Cedric! XD (On a side note: Considering the giggling girls Robert Pattinson truly is a good cast! *lol*) 5.) ”You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told?”Ron never ceases to amaze me! He’s such a shy guy but boy does he become a lion when he defends the people he cares about! <3 6.) ”Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you.”The Dementor’s Kiss reminded me of one of my rp characters that died through one. Ahh the good old roleplay times. *lol* Anyway, moving on! I was always intrigued by the idea of Dementors and even after so many years their existence and mystery still didn’t lose its appeal! They are really fascinating creatures and even though I never want to meet one I still can’t help but take an interest in them. =) Certainly one of the best things about this book! 7.) ”Mr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.”The first mention of the Marauder’s Map! “The Prisoner of Azkaban” is certainly one of those main books that build the foundation for everything that’s yet to come. And it’s already way darker than its predecessors. Bless Fred and George for handing Harry the map! Heaven knows he’ll have good use for it in the years to come. ;-P8.) ”They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead, and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them back.”It always kills me to read about how Harry struggles with the knowledge - or rather the lack of knowledge - about his parents. My heart bleeds for him whenever they are mentioned. I mean jeez, he’d endure a Dementor just to hear their voices. T_T9.) “She’s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her –“ Is it just me or is this actually a reoccurring theme? Since book one there always seem to be sections in which they don’t talk to each other because something gets in their way. And if my memory serves me right things are going to continue in this vein. XD 10.) ”She had slapped Malfoy around the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered.”Once again I want to point out that I’m a pacifist! The way Hermione dished out that slap was pretty spectacular though! *lol* Guess she took Mr. Weasley as an example. Haha! Sound advice for parents: You better don’t slap mean people in front of your kids! ;-P Also is it just me or did anyone else notice the irony of the situation? A person like Hermione, a person that values words, resorted to actions because she realized words won’t get her far with a Malfoy. *lol* 11.) ”THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING-““Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way-!”“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”Jordan’s Quidditch commentary is legit one of the best things about the series! Well and the matches themselves of course. XD Plus McGonagall swearing like a trooper because the Slytherin team was playing so foul is one of the best things ever! Haha! Especially because she obviously tried to keep everything objective and neutral at first. *lol*11.) ”I’m not doing this for you, I’m doing it because I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted his best friends to become killers – just for you.”Harry is a far better person than many others would have been! Even after everything Wormtail did he still didn’t allow Sirius and Lupin to kill him. He would have had every reason to let them finish him off yet he thought of the consequences for his father’s best friends first. Aside from that I still believe that Harry would have never allowed them to kill him because he knows it’s not right. If he proved anything to us by now, then it’s that he’s a very righteous and compassionate person.12.) ”I don’t want a bond with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!”“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me… the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”Once again the foreshadowing!!! Rowling is a master at this discipline! XDI can’t wait to read “The Goblet of Fire”! Not just because it’s one of my favourite HP books but also because I want to find out which other details I missed the first time around! It will get dark now and I’m so ready for it!!! <3_________________I’m on a Harry Potter roll this year!So now that Christmas is coming closer with every passing day it’s about time to dive into one of my favourites! =)I always liked “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! Not only because the kids have grown so much but also because it marks the beginning of the series getting all “Sirius”. *lol* (Sorry, I couldn’t help it. XD)But honestly, there are so many awesome things that happen in this book and there are so many new characters that are introduced, it’s just amazing! <3Happy reading! I’m sure I’ll have a good time!"

15,"""Oy! Presents!""I'm flabbergasted, again. This one deviates from what it had been for the first two books - by a mile!. Just when I thought the second one was more detailed compared to the first. Prisoner of Azkaban is much more complex, having a lengthier plot, more descriptive characters and environs, but still not lacking in any way. It makes the first two feel like short stories. I'm going to stop saying this is 'The Best' until I'm done with the series, for, right now it feels like it'll keep getting better till the series end. (So, it goes without saying, it's 'The Best So Far.')""The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business""Though the first two books were quite wonderful, the build-up for events seemed much better in this third book. The occurring of events seemed much less transparent, and manages to keep the reader well in suspense right till the end. The plot feels to be moving more in-line with the core of series - towards a bit darker side - as the first two had already laid a strong foundation. And the world of magic keeps expanding, with a lot of interesting elements being added to it! I hope I'm not getting ahead of myself when I say, this is becoming one of my favorite book series of all time.""I know how to use a fellytone now"""
16,"ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) / ITALIANO«Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard»Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban prison is on every wizard's lips. Not even the dreaded guards of the prison, the Dementors, managed to keep in a cage the wicked wizard, who probably want to meet again his master, Voldemort. But to do that, firstly he must kill Harry Potter, the only one capable to stand up to Voldemort... Meanwhile, the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry, Ron and hermione will become acquainted with two new professors...Compared to the previous, the third volume of the series is the one that is richer in twists and turns. I'm reading the saga of Harry Potter to my daughter, when in the evening she goes to bed, and in this ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a little tragedy happened. When we got to ""The kiss of the dementor"" chapter, just hearing the title my daughter (6 years old) was so upset by what it might happen that she required that I read that chapter alone, and just then telling her what was going on by omitting the scary details. Apart from this hiccup, the reading was neat and clean. It is evident that the playful and carefree tones of the first two adventures give way to dark colors. After all harry is growing up, and its way of seeing things is supposed to change as well. Rowling takes us in the maturation process of the most famous little wizard of the world using the same plot device of the previous volumes: the teachings of Headmaster Dumbledore, the clashes with Malfoy, the bickering with Hermione, the conflicts with Professor Snape. I do not know if in the near future I will continue to read to my daughter the Harry Potter saga, or if I will wait she grows enough to read it alone to avoid upsetting her again. Never mind. I will go on because now it is not possible for me to stop reading, with the pleasant awareness that there is no healthier addiction of this one. ""Get high"" yourself too.Vote: 10




«Harry Potter era un ragazzo insolito sotto molti punti di vista. Prima di tutto, odiava le vacanze estive più di qualunque altro periodo dell'anno. Poi voleva davvero fare i compiti, ma era costretto a studiare di nascosto, nel cuore della notte. E per giunta era un mago»La fuga di Sirius Black dalla prigione di Azkaban è sulla bocca di tutti i maghi. Nemmeno i temuti guardiani del carcere, i Dissennatori, sono riusciti a tenere in gabbia il malvagio stregone, che si dice voglia riunirsi al suo padrone, Voldemort. Per farlo però dovrà prima eliminare Harry Potter, l'unico che fino ad ora è stato in grado di tenere testa a Voldemort... Nel frattempo, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per cominciare il nuovo anno scolastico, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione faranno la conoscenza di due nuovi professori...Rispetto ai due precedenti, il terzo volume della serie è quello più ricco di colpi di scena, e di conseguenza quello con il ritmo più serrato. Sto leggendo la saga di Harry Potter a mia figlia quando la sera va a letto, ed in questo ""Harry Potter e il Prigioniero di Azkaban"" è successa una piccola tragedia. Arrivati al capitolo ""il bacio del dissennatore"", al solo sentire il titolo mia figlia (6 anni) è rimasta così turbata da quello che sarebbe potuto accadere che ha preteso che lo leggessi io da solo, e che le raccontassi quello che succedeva omettendo i particolari spaventosi. A parte questo intoppo, la lettura è continuata liscia. E' evidente che i toni giocosi e spensierati delle prime due avventure lasciano il posto a sfumature a tratti cupe e goticheggianti. D'altronde Harry sta crescendo, e si suppone che cambi anche il suo modo di vedere le cose. La Rowling ci accompagna nel processo di maturazione del maghetto più famoso del mondo utilizzando gli stessi espedienti narrativi usati negli altri volumi: gli insegnamenti di Silente, gli scontri con Malfoy, i battibecchi con Hermione, i conflitti con Piton. Non so se nell'immediato futuro continuerò a leggere a mia figlia la saga di Harry Potter, o se aspetterò che cresca abbastanza da essere in grado di leggerseli da sola per evitare adesso di turbarla. Non importa. Io andrò avanti perchè per me non è più possibile fermarmi, con la piacevole consapevolezza che non esiste dipendenza più salutare di questa. ""Drogatevi"" anche voi.Voto: 10"

Black in this book and I never looked back.I'm going to add some pictures from my book, although now, I wish I would have added more but it is what it is. . . maybe later I love these big illustrated coffee table editions of the books. It makes re-reading them an extremely fun experience. I just wish she would put them all out at once. I know, I know... I'm ready for the next though. Happy Reading!

18,"Sirius Black, a prisoner at Azkaban, has escaped and is out on the loose. How will Harry survive?I will likely rewrite this review at some point in the future as I have a serious cold and feel like I am on my deathbed. I need to layoff the Greek mythology because I might have muttered that I was the goddess of animals in a state of delirium. Anyways, Harry Potter.What I enjoyed about Harry Potter #1 was his wonderment and amazement. He is grateful that he isn’t going to be stuck with the Dursleys anymore. Now, in Harry Potter #3, the wonder and amazement are gone. Harry is constantly bemoaning that he can’t go to Hogsmeade. Harry Potter #3 does show some character development because Harry finally decides to stop waiting for someone to rescue him from the Dursleys and leaves on his own accord. I’m still completely baffled as to why he doesn’t make arrangements to stay with Hermione or Ron or even Hagrid. The story itself is ok. JK Rowling relies too heavily on the popularity of the fan favorite characters. The ending on this seemed to drag on and on. The book also lacked some originality. This book revisits many of the tropes that were explored in the first two books, starting off at the Dursley’s, going to school, and Quidditch. The books almost seem to follow a formula. Given the events in Harry Potter #3, I would have been more interested to hear the story from the perspective of Hermione (getting to know her Muggle family and what they think of the school, all of Hermione’s different classes, what the girls of the school think of her, etc.). Additionally, Professor Trelawney seemed like a watered-down version of Miss Cleo. Harry Potter #3 is longer than the first two installments, and it could have used some additional editing down. One of the biggest positives about this book is that now whenever I am eating some chocolate, I can tell people that I am just recovering from a dementor attack.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"

21,"August 2023. Rereading series to commemorate the twenty five years that Harry has been part of our collective history. Nothing like an all time favorite book to comfort me in the wake of an end of summer cold. Time. The things we could accomplish if we had extra time on our hands. Just this week I mentioned to people that I have been running on fumes with all the things I had to get done. If only I had a few extra hours in my week to take a nap or rest with a book. Thankfully, we have a leap year, providing our busy lives with a full extra day to get those things done that may have been pushed to the back burner. Whether it’s catching up on sleep, reading, or chores, a leap year creates the impression that there is indeed an extra day to accomplish those things that may have been pushed to the wayside. Despite this, adults rarely have the time to go back and savor favorite books, but, in 2020 a group of us in Retro Chapter Chicks have decided to take the time to reread Harry Potter in all its glory. I find it appropriate that on a day where we can enjoy extra time, that I curled up with my favorite book in the series, one that indeed tests the limit of place and time. A mass murderer has escaped from prison. The news is so important that it even made the Muggle news. Even Muggles who detest magic like the Dursleys are on high alert. For Harry Potter, a wizard about to enter his third year at Hogwarts, it is just another summer vacation. Although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school, at the Dursleys he is treated like less than human. His living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals. Even though Aunt Petunia is Harry’s blood relative, she also treats him like vermin. Things couldn’t get any worse until Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge arrives for a weeklong visit, and she believes that Harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family. What Marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that Harry did not exist. Harry’s true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic: his Hogwarts family. Each summer, life at Dursleys grows unbearable and Marge’s treatment of Harry puts things over the top. In a fit of teenage emotions, Harry causes Marge to blow up, and then he leaves the Dursleys home, for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time. Normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school, but, with a murderer named Sirius Black on the loose, the Minister of Magic himself has bent the rules in Harry’s favor. Minister Cornelius Fudge believes that Black is a dark wizard and servant of Lord Voldemort, and, in his eyes, the safest place for Harry is at Hogwarts under the watchful eyes of Albus Dumbledore. Harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the Dursleys and will indeed get to return to Hogwarts to continue his magical education. With the addition of Black to the storyline, the stories only get darker. Readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from Azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors, creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them. Fudge is convinced that Black is after Harry and has stationed dementors outside of Hogwarts, much to Dumbledore’s chagrin. As long as Dumbledore is headmaster, dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with Voldemort. Black was able to outsmart them, and all of England is on high alert. It is against this backdrop and protection that Harry returns to Hogwarts. Third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms. They are allowed to visit the village of Hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form; the Dursleys did not. Yet, they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine enroll in Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, taught by none other than Hagrid. Hermoine also begins the study of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies. Harry and Ron do not understand how anyone, even one as smart as Hermoine, could take that many classes. Some are at the same time as others, which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once. The dialogue between Ron and Hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two, a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize. Meanwhile, class work has gotten harder. Professor Snape loathes Harry more than ever, and the new Defense of the Dark Arts professor Lupin is an old friend of Harry’s father. Hagrid, while the nicest person around and Harry’s protector, is threatened by the Malfoys yet again, this time after Draco is scratched by a hippogriff named Buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class. Buckbeak is threatened with execution, adding to the animosity between Harry and Draco, and only Hermoine, on top of her grueling class schedule, finds the time to assist Hagrid in his defense. All these storylines would make for an exciting tale, but inserting Lupin and Black and Harry’s anti-dementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series. The story progresses, and animals play a key role in plot development: Ron’s rat, Hermoine’s cat, and a large black dog. The three are infinitely linked to one another. Rowling reveals that Black was the Potters’ secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to Voldemort. He was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named Peter Pettigrew. He is also Harry’s godfather. This information has Harry’s growing teenaged emotions on high. He is more determined than ever to defeat Voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness. Although teenaged pranks occur in this book, my favorite scenes are between Harry and Lupin and Black. Being able to interact with one of his parents’ closest friends, one really feels for Harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the Dursleys. As Rowling will reveal much, much later, Dumbledore has his reasons for placing Harry there, but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return, even if the presence of these Muggles is key to the plot line. Time, of course, plays a key role in the plot as well. Hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone. Sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book. He is innocent, yet the only people who believe him are Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and Professor Dumbledore. Lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf, and it is Pettigrew who is the servant of Lord Voldemort. This, Dumbledore explains to Harry, is magic at its deepest, most impenetrable moments and, in my opinion, the essence of the entire series. As Dumbledore points out time and again, it is one’s choices that determine one’s fate, not their abilities. For a few glorious moments Harry believes that he can live with Sirius and escape the Dursleys once and for all; it is the most touching moment, and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at Hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. Yet, this moment is indeed fleeting. The Ministry of Magic still believes that Sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on Buckbeak the innocent Hippogriff. Readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because Harry and Sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time. It makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading. Pretending that I do not know what comes next; however, knowing that Sirius and Lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book, a crossroads between the end of Harry’s adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon. Time. J.K. Rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days. Most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. The climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest. This year’s leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that I needed after a busy week. Even in this busy life that I lead, I have found the time to visit Harry Potter’s magical world yet again. As the plot moves deeper into Harry’s teenaged years, and, he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil, it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind. It is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all. 5+ stars All time favorite book"

So excited to finally tackle the illustrated version of this one.*********************I guess you can tell from my rating that this wasn't my all-time favorite HP installment, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I remember thinking that the movie was about a 3/5 star rating for me when I first saw it, but now that I've experienced the novel version, I can see how the ending in the book is so much more detailed and excellent than how they chose to portray the ending in the movie. Obviously I live for any appearance of the Weasley twins, and I was so excited to get to the book that features the marauder's map. ""I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!""

29,"Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. ""I don't know why I even bother,"" he muttered to himself. ""I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?""He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. ""A-HA!"" he yowled. ""Gotcha!"" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. ""Where you gonna run to now, ratty?"" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. ""Please,"" it said. ""Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!""""A mistake, eh?"" the cat said. ""We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....""He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. ""Think, Peter, think,"" he said. ""Gotta get out of here, but..."" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. ""You may just have given me my way out, cat,"" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. ""They'll think it was you,"" he said. ""They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord."" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. ""It's not safe here anymore."" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. ""If I were human,"" he said, ""the fall would kill me. But as a rat...."" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better..."
30,"Okay, I will admit it here, publicly, for the very first time: I've got a mad crush on Remus Lupin.How could I not have fallen hard for a man who, by day, has the vibe of a young Pablo Neruda, and by night strips down naked and takes on werewolf form? I mean, can you imagine having sex with this man?Well, I have. Several times. And, as a woman who read the entire Harry Potter series as an adult, rather than a child, I could not get over my joy when the series shifted from the wonderful, but somewhat saccharine, child-like storytelling in books 1 and 2 and took on a more mature feel.Please, don't get me wrong. I love the first two books in this series, but I love them for their magical quality, their appeal to children, and their overall introduction to this world.But The Prisoner of Azkaban, at least for me, marks the shift into adolescence and the less tidy endings.And, of course, the introduction of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to the plot.I loved rereading this third book the past two weeks with my middle child, and I can not get over this new set of the illustrated series by Jim Kay. I mean. . . I'm not sure I can imagine a reading experience more sublime. Can you?My two absolute highlights from this novel are:When Remus Lupin turns to Hermione Granger and says, “You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.” It's a shift from everyone poking fun of Hermione for being a teacher's pet or a “nerd” and acknowledging her as a force to be reckoned with.And Jim Kay's illustration of Harry summoning his first real Patronus. . . my God, I turned the page, and goosebumps ran down the entire length of my body. Then I cried like a child. My daughter, who was sitting next to me, wasn't exactly surprised (she's been around for the last two years of this horror called perimenopause), but she was like, “Mom, pull it together.”I couldn't help it. Damn it, I think I'd run back into a burning building to grab this book.Remus!"
