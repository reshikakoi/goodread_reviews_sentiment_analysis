Book Name,review
To Kill a Mockingbird,to kill a mockingbird is the worst kind of book it is a perfect example of a whiteguilt fantasy it attempts antiracism and only accomplishes the opposite no im not talking about the heavy usage of the word nigger most people fail to understand the issue i have even heard it implied that talking about race in such a manner is racist because we should be colorblind in a postracist utopian world no i am talking about the plot and the characters themselves calpurnia perpetuates the inherently racist mammy archetype and is the only black in the book portrayed as intelligent the rest are not only uneducated but they are explicitly written to be stupid yes the sole intelligent black is the one serving the white folk this is what harper lee is trying to tell you the good blacks are the subservient ones the book compares blacks to mockingbirds they are portrayed are harmless animals that should be treated accordingly animals subhuman you would not treat an animal needlessly cruelly and therefore you should not do the same to blacks this echoes the sentiment of many early abolitionist groups who still believed blacks to be inferior but just thought they deserved more rights than objects and they still believed in segregation that was just barely praiseworthy back then and it was an abhorrent belief by the time this book came out the book removes the idea of black resistance and depicts the blacks as passive creatures who are simply waiting for the white mans rescue atticus finch is a complete and blatant whiteguilt selfinsert it simultaneously never dares to put blacks in an aggressive position for fear of coming off as racist again harper lee completely misses the point  the worst part of all this is that most whites completely miss the point they might publish an edition with the word nigger removed thinking that the usage of the word in a novel shows inherent racism their nostalgia and racism blinds them from the fact that the book itself has racist messages at its core it was written to make white people feel better about themselves and is an antiracism attempt as awkward as somebody saying my favorite slaves are niggers it is demeaning to black students and it should not be taught in classrooms the very fact that this book is touted as a literary masterpiece mostly for the supposed antiracism rather than any exceptional prose or complexity is just another piece of evidence that racism is still alive and well  just to avoid any straw man arguments about me i believe the works of toni morrison and zora neale hurston to be worthless not due to racism but due to being poor literature i am not very political i dont believe progressive social themes or antiracism are prerequisites for a great novel and im not a victim of white guilt im just a reader who was disgusted by what i read and that alone gives me the right to speak on this novel and that alone is why i am speaking on it and that alone is what is relevant  oh yeah and on the quality of the writing itself all of the symbolism is contrived the characterization is flat and the prose fails to impress it is simply not a very good piece of literature you would do better to read something like invisible man a book that was wellwritten in addition to containing impressively profound social and racial commentary  stars i know i am risking a serious film at  moment and a club upside the head from captain obvious for voicing this but nabbit dog i still think it needs to be saidto kill a mockingbird is one of the best and most important american novels ever written okay i said it and i will wait patiently while you get your duhs and ders out of the way and hang your no shit signs outside for inspector holmes  okay now given the gruntload of reviewsratings this book has i know im not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is still i am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because i truly have a pile of love for this book sorry for taking the metanalogy there just now but i promise no more poop references for the rest of the review so if my review can bring a few more people into the atticus finch fan club i will be just flush with happy  on one level this book is a fairly straightforward coming of age story about life in a small alabama town during the great depression it has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that i think resonates with a lot of readers it certainly does with me and i think the adjective charm may have been invented to describe the novel  despite how easing flowing the narrative is this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race tolerance and human decency most importantly this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say not today asshole not on my watch  that is a lesson that i think we can never be reminded of too often when bad people do bad things to good people the rest of us good people need to sack up and be counted regardless of how scary it might be easier said then done i know but at least that should be the standard to which we strive  atticus fitch is the epitome of that standard he is the role model to end all role models and what is most impressive is that he comes across as such a real person there is no john waynejack bauerdirty harry cavalry charging bsd machismo about him just a direct unflinching unrelenting willingness to always do what he thinks is right as atticus daughter scout puts it so well it was times like these when i thought my father who hated guns and had never been to any wars was the bravest man who ever lived i was to make something crystal before going on because it is an important part of my love of this story notwithstanding this books powerful powerful moral message it never onceevercomes off as preachy or heavy handed there is no lecture to be given here the only sermon we are privy to is the example of atticus finch and the simple yet unwavering strength and quiet decency of the man even when asked by his daughter about the horrendous racism being displayed by the majority of the townsfolk during a critical point in the story atticus responds with conviction but without theyre certainly entitled to think that and theyre entitled to full respect for their opinions but before i can live with other folks ive got to live with myself the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience this is a special story oh and as a huge bonusit is also an absolute joy to read lees prose is silky smooth and as cool as the other side of the pillow read this book read it with your children read it with your spouse read it by yourselfread it the bigoted assclown that you work with or see around the neighborhoodjust make sure you read it it is a timeless classic and one of the books that i consider a life changer  stars highest possible recommendation  bonus quote this is scout talking to atticus after getting to know someone she had previously be afraid of   when they finally saw him why he hadnt done any of those things    atticus he was real nice    his hands were under my chin pulling up the cover tucking it around me most people are scout when you finally see them he turned out the light and went into jems room he would be there all night and he would be there when jem waked up in the morningemphasis added why is it when i pick up to kill a mockingbird  i am instantly visited by a sensory memory im walking home leaves litter the ground crunching under my feet i smell the smoke of fireplaces and think about hot cider and the wind catches and my breath is taken from me and i bundle my coat tighter against me and lift my head to the sky no clouds just a stunning blue that hurts my eyes another deep breath and i have this feeling that all is okay  why why this memory i mean this takes place in alabama and mostly in the summer well there is that one climatic scene on halloween but i bet its still hot enough to melt the balls off a brass monkey  it must be the school thing my daughter just finished reading it prompting me to give it another go to fall back into scouts world and pretend to be eight and let life simply be  how is that how can life for scout be simple i mean she lives in the south during the depression she has to deal with ignorant schoolteachers and town folk her ideas of what is right what is what it should be are laughed at by her schoolmates man and i thought my childhood was rough  still she lives in this idyllic town i mean except for the racism and the creepy neighbors and the whole fact that its you know the southforgive me im not immune to the downfalls of the north i mean we had witches and well ted bundy was born here but theres this sense of childlike innocence to this book that makes me believe in humanity even in the throes of evil what am i saying here i guess that this is a good pick me up  what i also get from this book is that i have severe daddy issues i consume atticus finch in unnatural ways he is the ultimate father he has the perfect response for every situation he is the transcendent character my heart melts at each sentence devoted to him and i just about crumble during the courtroom scene  am i gushing i sure am i was raised by a man who thought that budweiser can artwork was the epitome of culture that drinking a pack was the breakfast of champions that college was for sissies he could throw out a racial slur without a single thought care or worry to who was around i wont even get into the debatesrantings of a  yr old me vs a  yr old him what a role model  so i thank harper lee for giving me atticus i can cuddle up with my cider and pretend that im basking in his light i can write this blurb that makes sense to maybe a handful but that is okay i am approved of and all is good i had a much longer review written for this book but the comments were sadly annoying me so ill just make my opinions clear in two sentences because these are really the only thoughts about the book that matter to me  i was extremely bored by the majority of this novel and thus i did not enjoy it very much and no i will not reread it because i do not care most importantly though i dont believe a white savior narrative like this one is a story that should be so heavily defended by white people or pushed as an essential book in school curriculum today when there are better books about racism by people who have actually experienced it and especially when this book cares more about the white characters than the black ones so i dont really know what to say  i think i loved this book but for a reason beyond my understanding it never hooked me and it took me ages to finish it some chapters especially at the beginning were tedious and hard for me to get through them but then there were some chapters that i devoured the whole tom robinson trial and the last ones  i definitely learned a lesson or two from this book atticus is my new role model he is really incredible i also love scout and jem those kids will be in my heart forever oh and i loved the boo radley storyline it left me in awe  this book surely deserves  solid stars and i kinda feel bad for giving it  stars but the thing is i was struggling to finish it i swear i let out a relieved sigh when i read the last sentence  but all in all it was a great read  and cant tell you how much i loved the last chapters while the plot was very gripping and wellwritten the book didnt actually instruct me on how to kill a mockingbird i bought this book intending to do away with this obnoxious bird thats always sitting in my backyard and making distracting noises i had hoped this book would shed some light on how to humanely dispose of the bird but unfortunately it was this story about a lawyer and a falselyaccused criminal as i said the plot is great but nowhere in the book does it say exactly how to kill a mockingbird even in the evil times when john crow ruled the south and the blacks were scarcely more free than in times of slavery and were allowed no civic power nor respect from their erswhile masters who were white good men did their best  as regards this book the last phrase is a lie  atticus a lawyer and good and caring father a moral man represented a black man accused of raping a white woman he lost but hed done his best  that last paragraph is a lie  atticus belonged to the kkk thought that blacks were a distinctly lower form of human life and that separate development ie apartheid was the best way to go for these childlike people who didnt have the reasoning power to rule he said in go set a watchman  that last paragraph is mostly a lie  atticus did belong to the kkk but he did not really think blacks were a lower form of human life at all that was just what he said for the benefit of others he really thought their intellectual power and ability to organise was greatly to be feared he was frightened that whites would have to give up having a life of ease and wealth structured around the cheap labour black people had no alternative but to provide he didnt even want to have to consider them at all  atticus represented the accused black rapist only because if a white lawyer didnt then he was sure the naacp would send in a very clever black lawyer and not only that but insist since these times were officially free that black people sit on the jury then he would not be sure of a conviction the blacks then feeling their oats would move in to the town and start demanding rights and power much to the detriment of the extremely exploitative and racist whites  when harper lee wrote all this in go set a watchman her publishers were apparently horrified and got her to rewrite the book from the point of view of a decent man who felt racism was a great evil we were all equal is this why harper lee never wrote another book did she feel that her views were unacceptable and she wasnt going to kowtow to some liberal publishers up north who didnt understand the ways of the south is that why she didnt give interviews too shed followed the advice of her publishers been lauded and rewarded but humiliated as an artist  schools still teaching this book as a moral lesson should incorporate their understanding of the first draft go set a watchman otherwise they are doing the children a disservice in their moral education and furthering the ideas of paternalism is better than selfdetermination racism had its softer side and that ignoring the truth watchman to tell a good story is a perfectly fine concept for educationalists to embrace its not  five stars because it is a very wellwritten and enjoyable book and hangs together with go set a watchman perfectly  read years ago probably about  jan  im not going to do my usual thing where id try to explain what i liked about this book normally i would try to convince you why you should read it i would speak about how important this book is and what message it could impart to its readers around the world i would even say how it affected me personally today im not going to do that  instead i will simply say that i loved this book i loved its characters i loved its plot and i loved the eloquent way in which harper lee wrote it it made me laugh and it made me cry her words are real and her story is truth  this book is one of the wisest most finely crafted pieces of prose fiction i have ever read  i didnt want it to ever end a friend of mine once commented that to kill a mockingbird was the most racist book hed ever read  i agree with him now i know this book is drawn from the authors true experiences but she choose to write a novel and thus i will judge it as a novel with its irrevocable integration into the american and canadian public school curricula i think this novel has probably done more to perpetuate racial stereotypes than any other single force  if i had to sum up to kill a mockingbird in one sentence this would be it the poor helpless black man is lost until a saintly white man comes to his side to crusade for his cause unfortunately the damn darkie is so stupid that he goes and gets himself killed just when the white man figured he had another shot at clearing him oh well the white man tried his best and for a negro too what a hero  what the hell is that this was the book that made me fall in love with reading its a stunning novel which was lightyears ahead of its time and deservedly remains a classic to this day the first time i read this i was much  much younger and i remember loving it then  over forty five years later it still held so much for me  wonderful language and characters that i never forgot about and relevancy even so many years later   im not sure i have an original thought or feeling that someone else hasnt already articulated so i will only say that for me the beauty of this book lies in how lee has so perfectly captured the time in the s and the place maycomb and the life in this small town and what it meant to be black then and there and how a young girl tries to make sense of what is happening around her  its a portrait of a place that comes alive because of the richness of the characters  yes its about racism in the south in the s  and about family and how life in a small town can shape people or not if you are atticus finch but my heart belongs to scout   i decided to reread it in preparation for reading go set a watchman because my first reading had been so long ago  i wish i had done what my gr friends diane s and diane b did in not rereading tkam but choosing to read go set a watchman and judging it on its own for what it is  i was more than halfway through tkam when i saw their perspective on this and it was just too late  i was just too hooked on the book again i remembered some but it felt as if i was reading it for the first time  being introduced to this time and place and this story and to beloved scout  jem atticus and calpurnia  miss maudie and boo once again  there will just not be anything like this book and now im looking forward to reading go set a watchman and approaching it for what it is  not a sequel but the seed of the iconic book  i think im going to wait a bit to read it  i want to savor what ive just read  after watching friends reunion i felt like going back my high school times to revisit my reading list and picked up my one of the all time favorite reads  i am rereading this book at different timelines of my life and i always find something different to like getting attracted by different details changing my mind about which character is my favorite nope actually last thing is a total lie i love jean louise scout finch her narration her growing up her innocent and curious mind made her reserve a special place on my heart shes the daughter of charismatic righteous atticus finch who is one of the remarkable characters in the literature history a prominent lawyer defending black man who is accused of raping a white woman which results with townies growing hatred against the entire family  its a bold well developed story takes place in monroeville alabama on  a quiet fascinating lesson of civics lesson of history and lesson of ethics  my fifth time reading goes smoothly and reminding me of how much i loved the story of small town a country townies neighbors brave criticism of racism  if you prefer audibook option sissy spacek did a hell of a great job  here are my favorite quotes  best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open  you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it  mockingbirds dont do one thing except make music for us to enjoy they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corn cribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird  people generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for  until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read one does not love breathing giving one of the most acclaimed books of all time a  makes me feel all loveydovey there was a time when i didnt agree with most of the established literature but now that ive read tkam that issue has partially been addressed  i approached reading this book with wariness and some pessimism and also with low expectations the year it got its pulitzer was a decade or two since the war the likes of herman wouk one of my favorite authors were no longer on the scene  this was a sensitive topic in real life the civil rights movement was ongoing so much was at stake harper lee was a child of the times but she could see far into the future her book was prophetic  each of the words of this book seems to have been cleverly crafted how many pages of it were rewritten this book is the work of a genius its high literature in the garb of normal words  i loved this book so much its very modern sounding i watched the movie first but the book is better as it usually is with these two mediums ill never read go set a watchman but the author has earned my undying respect to kill a mockingbird what a title what a book thus it becomes crystal clear why this classic is a must for kids surely it stands on an even shelf with the harry potter series take in mind its a millennial writing this review its ripe with conventions that can be cracked open in the classroom where the love for literature begins for most american children the emblematic character of atticus finch is a great figuremysterious righteous progressivecompletely just and good intelligent as is scout the precocious girl who filters all the goings on in her sleepy alabama town  it is a pity i did not read this in middle school when foundations are forged with human values and the artistic possibilities of storytelling that being said i cannot but smile at finally at  having plowed through this a complicated and personal classic it depicts a gonewiththewind america it has a strong pointofview which is restricted and accurate the character is alive  becomes an avatar of the impressed young reader himherself it is a history lesson a lesson in civics and law a segue toward laws and government and most importantly it includes a lovable naivete which borders on the poetic the comingofage strangeness including body changes and adolescent yearnings all of these are staples of the ya novel because it includes pretty much each and every one it is the quintessential ya book it has aged however  it is easy to see where the conventions are deposited as if to kill were a rough patchwork quilt of american literature musts alabama year  in total depression atticus finch a lawyer in the small town of maycomb raises his two children with calpurnia the cook at the storys beginning jem the eldest at  years old reveres his father he is protective and curious in short an easygoing child scout the youngest aged  failed sort of tom sawyer with his tongue hanging out to the dismay of his aunt alexandra in the company of dill the scout lover thats the holidays they go hunting for ghosts and legends the kind of games we all play as children alas the time of innocence will have an end especially for jem then the children confront the adult world and the reality of the segregationist south he will accuse of rape on a white woman tom robinson defended by atticus a courtappointed lawyer in this novel published in  civil rights are still in their infancy despite the black communitys  boycott of buses in alabama thats the th amendment being voted in  and prohibiting any segregation this courageous novel is about when the ku klux klan dictated its law the white balaclavas and flaming crosses remind blacks who want a dignified life not to cross the yellow line in this story where the freshness and innocence of scout and jem almost make us forget the initial message ie respect for the person and human rights  do not shoot the mockingbird still falls short of the novel the colour of feelings i have always liked these novels where children have the leading role these initiatory novels in treasure island or oliver twists lineage these said do not shoot the mocking bird remains a literary monument to be put in all hands to kill a mockingbird has become such a potent cultural symbol in the western world especially in the united states that you risk being seen as an insensitive cynic or a heartless bastard if you sound a dissenting note from a moral standpoint it attacks institutionalised racism against the black people in the united states back in the day when it was common to treat them as subhumans this is a noble goal but judged on criteria of literary merit i contend that theres not much in the book  flannery oconnor called it a childrens novel she did not intend it as a compliment the novel suffers from a saccharine dose of sentiment and it is fair to label it as a blackandwhite clich literally i found the characters twodimensional singly pursuing their idea without meaningful conflict that could have lent them some humanity atticus finch a morally upright man and gentle father is the authors moralising mouthpiece who supine and misty in the early stages of the story is catapulted into action when he takes upon himself to defend the black man if theres more to atticus im sure to have missed it completely there is an oftquoted famous line that goes like this  you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it  a bit of captain obvious wouldnt you say it would have been illuminating if ms lee could make the reader climb inside the skin for a walk  you can split the book into two separate novellas neatly like a cake so big is the disconnect between the first half which reads like an interesting ghost story and the second half which is no more than a reportage on the proceedings of a criminal case in a court of law where a black man is facing false charges of rape through these court proceedings ms lee tries to paint a dismal picture of the times when hapless black people didnt stand a chance once a white man accused them of wrongdoing  if one is to judge a work of fiction one is to judge it for the style of its narrative method and what the writer has attempted to do in it but theres a common fallacy as id call it of judging arts worth based entirely on the subjective moral urgency of its social content this is not to say that i do not understand the need to incorporate minority voices that had been suppressed into mute existence for many centuries but this story unlike toni morrisons novels is written from the white mans perspective quite a few famous postcolonial novels fall in this category thin on literary craft but still appreciated for their social or political import so i can understand why an average novel like this one spoke so strongly to the changing zeitgeist and struck a chord with millions of readers until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read one does not love breathing  to be honest reading the first part of this book felt a bit strange  seemed like it was moving a little slow  while not making it clear in which way the story is being steered but one will not feel like stop reading it because of style of narration the implied mystery in certain areas and the wonderful memories of protagonist and his brother  you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view   but then things get much momentum and keep on until the end aside from the obvious entertaining events of the story  namely the realities and hardships of racism  the author has succeeded in expressing the correct morals a person is supposed to have through the dispositions of the main characters empathy being the main one in my opinion loved the book and will definitely reread this in years to come  the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience  its never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name it just shows you how poor that person is it doesnt hurt you you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view  this is a novel that i have read countless times over the years and it never fails to connect with me on some level with every reading that is no small feat for a book to accomplish to speak to people the world over for over  years means that there is something universal in this text we are all the mockingbirds of the title and anyone who has reached the age of majority knows the feelings that the loss of innocence and the harsh light of reality can create in a person harper lee wrote a novel that captured the essence of that most universal of experiences and i for one am moved by it every time i wont rehash plot points but i will give you some reasons why you should read and then reread this text the first reason is for the beautiful depiction of imaginative childhood the narrator her brother jem and their friend dill embody most of the traits of childhood and their creative games and thought processes are a joy to behold the voice of scout the narrator is a pitch perfect recreation of childhood and childish impulses part i chapters  of this book are possibly the best recreation of childhood that i have come across in literature another reason is a pretty simple one actually the character of atticus finch is one of the noblest literary creations ever written i want to be like him and there are not many characters in literature i can or would say that about the fact that being like atticus is possible makes him even more endearing to me he is someone who is noble in every sense of the word and serves as an inspiration for so many reasons he is a good father a decent and empathetic man and a person who tries to see the good in almost anything the fact that there are so few atticus finches in real life makes him seem all the more desirable to me it is obvious as you read this text that ms lee loves this character atticus emphatic desire to see all people as humans and worthy of respect even when those people are undesirable is a lesson for our and all time it is a trait that many people preach but few actually practice let someone vote for someone you do not like or have a leader you cant stand and then watch the ugly flow forth atticus resists those impulses at every turn in this novel and i am inspired by that there are numerous other reasons why this is a stellar work of genius not least of which is the wonderful plotting of the novel the excellent and fleshed out supporting characters these people are real to me and the message that lee finds numerous ways to reiterate throughout the book when you get to the beautiful and brilliant chapter  the thematic heart of the novel begins to unfold and every time i visit maycomb county i find myself tearing up a little at such beautifully human moments the texts final chapter never fails to move me emotionally because it is so understated and powerful ms lee has created a pastoral version of the depression era south and even though there is vicious bigotry and hatred depicted in the novel ms lee through her characters does not give up on them or us the world and we can be better we just need to remind ourselves to walk in other peoples shoes once in a while so far i have found that this book is complete drivel i dont understand the mass appeal to this novel nor do i understand how it managed to go down in history as an amazing piece of america literature this book has no plot no point and no real characters  the characters in this book are one dimensional and painfully drab they all seem to have the same personality with a few minor differences and all that does is create boring dialogue and an uninteresting point of view harper lee may be talented with using advanced vocabulary but that does not make her a good writer  there is no conflict in this book theres no personality theres nothing interesting that compels me to read more  im fairly far into the book and yet i still have no idea what it is about if i could rate this book no stars i would do so this book is a necessary read for my honors english class but if i could get away with not reading it i would do it without a bit of hesitation  as soon as i am done with this sorry excuse for a book i am either going to tend to my fireplace using the pages as kindling or stash this book in the far corners of my basement where it will live out the rest of its days in darkness i am not afraid to say with all honesty that this is possibly one of the most terrible wastes of paper i have ever laid eyes on theres a beating heart inside some books theyre magnetic theyre warm one can feel their strength and 
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",both of my kids were born after the whole harry potter series was released they are now old enough to start appreciating the story so i thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them while it did take us a while because you know    life happens    we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter it was really fun to see them getting into it  they are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the chamber of secrets  original review  one of my first jobs was at a bookstore when i was a kid my mom would take me to the mall and i would spend tons of time hanging out at waldenbooks who here remembers waldenbooks right when i became legally old enough to work i went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later i was selling literature to the masses  why do i tell you this story on this review you ask well at the time young adultteen literature consisted mainly of rl stein christopher pike beverly cleary judy blume and a few other classic newberry award winners but certainly we did not have a ya section to the extent you see it today  towards the end of my tenure at waldenbooks  as oprahs book club was hitting its stride and men are from mars women are from venus was in its bazzilionth week on the new york times best seller list  a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard i remember the display at the front of the store and selling a few copies but i didnt realize what it would become  a few years later early s i had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books i had just finished college which had taken up most of my free reading time a friend of mine named bronco yup real name not a nickname who also was the best man at my wedding had a copy of this book on his coffee table holy cow here is that same book we were selling at waldenbooks about  years before  what was he doing with it  well he said it was good so i borrowed it i quickly plowed through the first  books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of order of the phoenix and i noticed when i went to the bookstore the ya section and selection was not so small anymore i truly believe it was harry potter that opened the door to get more young adults and even adults of course reading and authors interested in writing for that genre this book was okay i didnt hate it or love it either way though towards the end i realized how lukewarm i felt about the story since i would prefer to read any other book i had on hand i appreciate the level of novelty in the worldbuilding during the time this was first published the friendship between the trio is cute hermione and ron are fun characters and i might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists downsides i cringed at the excessive fatphobia antisemitism and the turban part i also didnt like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fadetoblack moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters it felt like such an abrupt way to end the story but tbh i was glad to be done with it so i could move on to other books lol original review  i read this book a couple of years ago and for some unknown reason never continued on it was just as wonderfully magical as i remembered a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me i have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people theres something for everyone here whether you are  or  hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you wont find elsewhere  i truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done but my personal favorites are the weasley twins hagrid and professor mcgonnall while ive seen all the movies and know the general storyline im really excited to experience the story first hand and see what all was left out from the films im also intrigued to find out more about each house especially the ones that took a backseat in this story not sure if i can say anything that hasnt been said before but i loved it  on my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me number  is that they gave me at  years old the perfect excuse to revisit the harry potter series  when my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the harry potter books i couldnt have been happier as i was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room i started feeling nostalgic for the whole hogwarts gang and i realized that id never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume i figured it was high time to rectify that oversight  harry deserves it  however with over a million ratings and almost two reviews for every day ive been alive i think i can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles it has all been eloquently said before therefore i just want to briefly express what i see as the essential magic at the heart of the series and why i think it has resonated so strongly with so many people  here goes  only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings one that can hold at bay even if only for precious moments the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life these stories do that  its an escape into a world of optimism honor and hope where things always look hopeful and anything is possible who wouldnt want to hang around in a place like that especially when it is decorated with sorting hats kindly giants magic wands and quidditch  grantedno aspect of the story is revolutionary or even particularly noteworthy from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre it isnt great literature and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success  fineacknowledged and so what  the virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers harrys story is something that radiates acceptance inclusion and friendship it invokes a sense of belonging inside these pages you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanitys nature and feel just a little better about the world around you  how is that not worthy of praise  as for harry himself hes just a good kid the quintessential everyman who makes good a loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him hes someone you cant help but like  hes not perfect he makes mistakes hes occasionally short sighted and i know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet or give dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas  but thats not harry hes a better person than that thats why we love him  maybe all of the above is a bit much like i said i was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me lets just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy  ill certainly settle for that  as for the rating i initially only gave this first volume  stars and im not going to change that now as much as i love the series as a whole i dont think it reaches stratospheric heights until harry potter and the goblet of fire  still this is where it all began as such it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better   stars highly recommended ate childrens list j k rowling the chronicler of harry potter thus has an unusual distinction she has changed the policy of the policymaker  imaginative vision  i read new childrens literature when i can find some of any value but had not tried rowling until now i have just concluded the  pages of the first book in the series harry potter and the sorcerers stone purportedly the best of the lot though the book is not well written that is not in itself a crucial liability it is much better to see the movie the wizard of oz than to read the book upon which it was based but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision harry potter and the sorcerers stone does not so that one needs to look elsewhere for the books and its sequels remarkable success such speculation should follow an account of how and why harry potter asks to be read  the ultimate model for harry potter is tom browns school days by thomas hughes published in  the book depicts the rugby school presided over by the formidable thomas arnold remembered now primarily as the father of matthew arnold the victorian criticpoet but hughes book still quite readable was realism not fantasy rowling has taken tom browns school days and reseen it in the magical mirror of tolkein the resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of realitytesting may read oddly to me but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time  in what follows i may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of harry potter but i will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare such as kenneth grahames the wind in the willows or the alice books of lewis carroll is it better that they read rowling than not read at all will they advance from rowling to more difficult pleasures  rowling presents two englands mundane and magical divided not by social classes but by the distinction between the perfectly normal mean and selfish and the adherents of sorcery the sorcerers indeed seem as middleclass as the muggles the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to hogwarts a rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught hogwarts is presided over by albus dumbeldore as headmaster he being rowlings version of tolkeins gandalf the young future sorcerers are just like any other budding britons only more so sports and food being primary preoccupations sex barely enters into rowlings cosmos at least in the first volume harry potter and the philosophers stone is a fantasy novel written by british author j k rowling  it is the first novel in the harry potter series and rowlings debut novel first published in  by bloomsbury  it was published in the united states as harry potter and the sorcerers stone by scholastic corporation in   the plot follows harry potter a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  with the help of his friends harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard lord voldemort who killed harrys parents but failed to kill harry when he was just  months old  as wonderful and magical as promised because i didnt remember the movie the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me  i wish id had this book when i was a kid because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you  i wasnt always the most ardent fantasy reader but even since reading the hobbit and the lotr trilogy that quickly changed and figured what better way to continue the journey than harry potter im very glad i did so had i really known how fun and thrilling harry potter is i wouldve read all books many times over by now but better late than never i guess  dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers  i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves  right off from the beginning what stood out to me most was how easy it is to read everything may be it is because the author moves mainly along building characters  which are much quickly understood  instead of building a detailed fantasy world unlike in a tolkien novel where we are given every minuscule detail of the world harry potter is far more character focused and has been done amazingly i never dreamed ill this fascinated by a childrens book  there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them  now that im finished with the first book i cannot help regretting why didnt i read this before this is far far better than watching the movie  and considering how enjoyable the movies are thats saying a lot definitely going to revisit this one many times hopefully cannot wait to start reading the next one   ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here  i think everyone has that one book that made you fall in love with reading one book that opened your eyes to a world beyond the one in which you live one book that burrowed itself inside your heart and became a part of you one book that will forever feel like coming home every time you read it  i know im not original when i say harry potter is that one book and series for me but this is what got me into reading it gave me a childhood far more magical and imaginative than i could have ever asked for the series taught me the value of empathy that courage comes in many different forms the importance of having and being a true friend that love is the greatest power above all and most importantly it taught me to believe in magic i would not be who i am today without this book and i love that stories have the power to do that to change lives for the better  i owe so much to this little book that became such a massive part of my life and to think it all started with a young boy who lived under the stairs   its never too late to get back to magic school even if one is just a dirty muggle  quite a while ago i was young so young omg what happened where is all the time how could this hopeful young boy become such a demoni sorry typo i read this thing and now i thought that a reread might be an extremely interesting experience especially regarding my obsession of vivisecting literature with the help of the almighty tvtropes but there is a problem  i have a massive deficit of reading all kinds of fantasy because the series take such huge amounts of time there is a hyperinflation of ya and high fantasy and i am more into scifi humor and horror so i cant really compare it with other similar kids and ya fantasy literature but i can just cherrypick any weird thought frankenstein it together mwuahahaha call it a review post it run and hope that nobody notices i should have put this to the end of the review  it would be really interesting to know which elements were already there maybe even in similar constellations and which were rowlings own unique inventions the underdog group of friends the systems of magic the only sure thing and constant in fantasy might be the big bad evil lurking in the background while the sockpuppet antagonistic humans prepare the final war more comparisons could be interesting in the other direction the future my obsession too because there might have been the one or other opportunistic genre swifts series subgenres heavily influenced by harry that are now beginning to collide with newer hypes and trends quite a freaking amazing evolution  i am not sure if a man could have written a similar piece because there are gosh gender differences yes i just dissed and discriminated against my own gender sue me if you want ive legal expenses insurance so good luck with that but my perfectly politically incorrect opinion is that there are genres and readers that just perfectly fit together or not and in these cases different genders gender identities etc are prone to reading and writing gender specific content although there may be female hard scifi plot focused writers with minimalistic characterizations and male authors writing soft epic romantic fantasy they are exceptions and i dont deem this diversity something negative on the contrary i will just shout out that a man would maybe not have been able to write such a compelling book and that potter could have failed or at least not have had such immense success without the feminine touch now ill be roasted trolled and hunted down but that was totally worth it stupid haters get a life i should really consider reducing the offending the audience level  rowling did an immensely good job in using sandersonslaws of magic to make anything interconnected and somewhat even linking character traits to certain kinds of magic systems and preferences while aiming at one of the biggest and fangirlyboysest audiences possible young readers many of these wont have seen similar uses in old unknown works or still too difficult to enter high fantasy concepts and will be blown away when they first enter this amazing universe  faith stereotypically and predictably far less creative and open minded than the young readers helped in promoting potter by talking about the danger of magic and such trivial evil works on kids and children really bigots did you learn nothing out of  millennia of religious wars witch burning and genocides sigh as already said haters gonna hate but at least this ridiculous attempts of demonizing one of the most pop cultural big bangs of all time helped to make it even more popular what did they fear that millions of boys and girls start doing black magic break quantum dimensional time travel stuff and unleash the flying spaghetti monster that would ruin their assets  the extreme success of rowlings excessive use of adjectives and breaking many other rules of this so called self proclaimed quality newspaper writing gurus high brow literature ill tell anyone to write just with my only right recipe because this is how art has to be done and creativity has to be unleashed under controlled circumstances is a good reason for rofling around all day seriously nobel price elitist high culture literature trash womanman how many people would read your favorite old and cheap as dirt garbage if schools and universities wouldnt buy this ridiculous bad writing fueled by nationalism pride about the big sons why no sisters each nation on earth with its own terrible old big prodigies of writing weird boring bad concoctions because they were the only freaking elitist people writing something centuries or decades ago to torture helpless young people and make them hate reading for the rest of their lives close to nobody and honestly whats wrong with you ever so sophisticated literary critics fine arts professors and wannabe pseudo intellectuals looking down at literature that kids love and thats made for them while promoting the haters troll train that bores them out steals their time and makes them functional illiterates go harry transform them from the inside out into the slimy stinky creatures they truly are that escalated quickly  looking at a kind of big history picture of the socio cultural impact of one of the most successful fantasy series ever one could ironically say that its the ultimate exaggerated interpretation of what could be behind the words using soft sciences and magics maybe doing so is wrong true ingenious stupid deep a waste of time however how audiences perceive and philosophy about groundbreaking works by reflecting its impact is maybe one of the greatest extra joys of reading  one of the coolest magic tricks would be to reactivate the fully immersive flow and flash of reading when young but i can at least feed on the reminiscences of already quite blurry pictures and sharpen them while rereading one of the most groundbreaking fantasy works ever that helped make hundreds of millions of kids and the one or other adult avid readers i was a young adult when this first book came out and the print book never really grabbed me when i gave it a try i found that i very much enjoyed the american audiobooks with jim dale narrating however so i read the first few books this way but this came to an end when i misplaced the fourth book and no longer had a long commutei never did reach the end of that wretchedly long quidditch game so i gave up  but here it is  and im trying again this time im doing the wonderful stephen fry narration on audio its interesting to come into these books after all this history both in the sense of the cultural impact of these stories as well as the knowledge of how much childrens lit as art and as industry has changed for the better because of them  somehow i managed to avoid the entire harry potter franchise my whole life a fact im not proud of but am very happy about because i got to go into this book knowing absolutely nothing and it was spectacular  i loved every moment of this book it was fun and magical and i got utterly lost in the wizarding world as i learnt all about it alongside harry so clever beautiful plot  this book series is iconic and for such good reason  theres not much else i could say that hasnt already been said a million times before this book series is a classic and i am honoured to have read it i am having the best time reading the books ive already moved on to the rest of the series and i cannot wait to be finished so that i can go back and reread them this is my second time reading this book i still remember how i enjoyed it very much years ago when i read it for the first time like it was so magical and adventurous and i fell in love with the series right away after i finished reading the first book so i decided to reread it this year because i miss all of the characters the humor and the adventure moreover this series also changed me i wouldnt be the woman i am today without this series  and also along with other books   i still liked the book but i just felt like it wasnt as fun as i read it for the first time when i began rereading this book i still remembered the story and the events clearly so thats probably why i didnt enjoy it like i used to but i still liked it it was fun and great  my favorite scene in this book is when harry hermione and ron wanted to reach the philosophers stone and then ron and harry were some kind of tangled or strangled by a plant and the thing to save them was something that emanated warmth and suddenly hermione said that there were no woods and ron was angry and shouted whether shes a witch or not because she could easily conjure a spell to help them and i guess she forgot that she could do that and i honestly laughed out loud because its so funny hahaha maybe hermione was still getting used of being a witch do i even need to list all the reasons why this book was a joy to read the writing style was easy to read but wasnt simple or standard it still had its unique twist to it which lead to me finally reading one of those books where you just cant decide what age group it was written for i genuinely believe that the story would be enjoyed by everyone whether its my yearold brother or my grandma who is about to turn   they all would have a pleasant and joyful reading experience i also totally did not expect to laugh so much while reading  theres some really dry and wonderful humor in here  despite this being my first time reading harry potter the story wasnt new to me i was a huge fan of the first five movies when they were released but for some reason never bothered to watch the rest i dont understand my younger self my obsession was quite big for a while but after the initial enthusiasm had ceased i never watched any of them again in retrospect ive got to say that this was a good thing because i now got more and more excited every time i recognized a name or remembered a scene that came up  if i had to criticize anything it would be about the length of some of the more intense scenes i guess they could have done with a bit more buildup however thats really just nitpicking and the main reason for that complaint is my wish for the book to have more pages so i could be staying in this world for a longer duration and finding out more about the lovely characters it also needs to be taken into consideration that this is just the first installment of a series with seven parts looking at the length of some of the later books im sure i will get my wish fulfilled in the near future after billions of years i finally read this book and i came to the conclusion that i would have liked this more if i had read it at a younger age i reread potter   this very book  and was very aware of how inspired how clever rowlings storytelling is  try as i might i cant see the current writers of urban fantasy or ya paranormal romance beat rowling in terms of raw writing ability  how did jk rowling write sorcerers stone without magic she had the same impact on me aswell lets say that as someone who doesnt visit other countries to observe the sistine chapel or whatever my top three best art experience is  one piece  harry potter  the beatles i simply adored this book  it was such a fast and funny read also it brought childhood memories back because i saw the first harry potter movie when i was  years old and i was so nostalgic remembering it all   im not used to read books after i watched the movies but itll be that way with my harry potter books because im a huge fan of the movies and ive already saw them all the good thing is that i dont really remember anything at all haha just the big parts oh and also the deaths cries  sooo i loved this book and im impressed by that i mean i knew i was going to like it but it was so much more since the first page it had me hooked jk rowling has such a fluid writing style i never got bored and i was gasping in some parts even when i knew what was going to happen on this occasion of having now read the first book of this mega bestselling and loved series for a third time i feel that as time passes this book and series lean towards being generally deemed as modern classics despite all the hype and adulation it really is a wonderful book and a wonderful read but not really my cup of tea this might simply be because i never read it as a child it might be because that hermione is so well written that i wished it was her series it might be because harry and ron are so well written as young boys that i cant stand them and have no empathy for their characters im a much bigger fan of the weasley twins luna snape and neville  out of  three star read  pathetic really pathetic  harry potter is more of a marysue than eragon more than nancy drew more than the worst of fanfiction ive seen  hes rich popular and famous for absolutely nothing of his own doing he destroys the power of the big bad guy before hes a year old he has the whole angsty past down pat he instantly becomes the best at flying without ever having done it before wasting all the older and more experienced flyers and get this  he fries bad guys when they touch his skin because the power of his mothers love is so amazing that it protects him  i mean gosh the only sueish habit we arent subjected to is multipage rants on his appearance each morning or the devoted unicorn of unusual powers of course but im expecting him to show up in the very next book after all she has to keep some plot devices for the next one doesnt she cant put all her brilliant twists out at once  heavy sarcasm  dont even get me started on the plot epic failure nuff said  harry wasnt any excuse for a hero he did nothing he just sat around and things happened to him end of story his fame was inherited his fortune was inherited he lived with his relations and allowed them to bully him and couldnt even manage to read his own mail his wonderful skills were not worked at and studied for years but picked up instantly and he bet the bad guys by electrocuting them with his infamous zapper skin  i could go on for hours the thing that really gets to me is that this is the great literature of our age what hope is there for any decent writers if all kids want to read is this utter garbage what hope is there for the world if kids are growing up thinking this is good literature  this is a dangerous book it made me consider both suicide and mass homicide and it is definitely not suitable for children yes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be taken  this book ends so well so very wellwritten it does feel there is a drastic and kind of unrealistic change in harry  from the life in  privet drive to fighting a full size troll at hogwarts  but alright he also did not know about being a wizard  you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose about all  the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them in the harry potter series jk rowling perfects the most important rule of story telling be interesting her prose might not be great although it is good her plots and mysteries might be a little convoluted but damn can she tell an interesting story build a fun world and put great characters in it  from the first sentence she lets you know what fun youre in for theres just that magical touch to it only she seems to have and she keeps it going through the whole book and the six others in the series without missing a beat  the sorcerers stone is packed with mystery it starts early and picks up speed burning through pages right to the reveal which is quite the surpriseno scoobydoo ending here  but the thing that really makes this book stand out is the characters harry potter ended up getting on my last nerve in the series but in this book hes crazy likable the minor characters are what really make the series though they have more personality than the protagonist of most books  this series might not be the best but theres nothing like it its just magical plain and simple in the harry potter series jk rowling perfects the most important rule of story telling be interesting her prose might not be great although it is good her plots and mysteries might

the ball rolling for so many of us the book was set in the s and im almost the same age as harry would be  for some time it would be so tempting to pretend that magic exists jk rowlings seal on this type of mysterious novel has never been attempted before the book has many influences but in the end it stands alone  did i broach on how fun it was to read these books this reread is the first since joining goodreads loved it and most characters are so funny including the backfiring handed to malfoy  its been a privilege to read book  of the series i know how it will end but let me enjoy book  in quiet book  made me cry but the joy of books  is unrivaled we will never see it matched in the future not until decades and maybe a couple of centuries later  i tried to find special ideas to show my love for these books but i cant do it justice lets leave out the cold word bildungsroman until later oh why yes my name is sana and i really did not like this  dont kill me thanks goodbye  ive been thinking a lot and this is actually  stars  this is such a hugely popular series that my review is probably not necessary but i feel compelled to at least note how immensely important and impactful this book can be  forget about the need for fantastic childrens literature ignore the movies dont even consider the amount of money and product built from the empire of harry potter think purely about the imagination an author created not only with this first book but the entire series  a child who feels lost and alone a world of magic where you still struggle a history of good and evil a school divided amongst houses a land of muggles and one of witches imagination runs wild and with absolute infinite options  intepretation on themes and imagery cannot be any greater connections of every sort can be made t
Pride and Prejudice,i am so unqualified to write about this book  i am physically unqualified because i could write infinite words about how much i love this book and i type in a weird way that makes my wrists hurt so infinity is simply not going to happen  i am emotionally unqualified because i lack emotional intelligence when it comes to my own feelings and the idea of trying to explain how i feel about this book is overwhelming  i am spiritually unqualified because of the aforementioned overwhelmedness  i am also unqualified generally in the grand scheme of things because so many people have written so intelligently about the wonderfulness of this book and i have nothing better to add  just more rambling like this  i read a lot of romance and if you want to venture a theory as to why id love to hear it i very seldom like it so maybe its a masochist tendency maybe im a glutton for the attention that writing negative reviews of popular books gives me definitely not that one since the few mean comments always outweigh the far more numerous nice ones in my stupid brain whatever  i read a lot of romance but i almost never feel anything about it  i love this book it gives meuheveryone stop reading this to save me the embarrassment and allow me to preserve my rough and tumble reputationbutterflies  i know im cringing forever but its true  this is a lovely book its beautifully written its funny its filled with characters who feel full and real and different from one another even though half of them have the same name and it truly is the best love story ever told  what more could you ask for spoiled rotten the lot of you  bottom line a dream pride and prejudice by jane austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me up until about page one hundred i found this book vexing frivolous and down right tedious i now count myself as a convert to the austen cult  i must confess i have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before  i just cannot get down with corsets outdoor plumbing and buggy rides whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over this is a shortcoming i readily own up to but have no desire to correct so i admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes i did really enjoy ang lees sense and sensibility however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down i dutifully picked it up  boy did i hate him at first to get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century at first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold i liked the language to be sure austens dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone no matter how delicious does not a great novel make  a hundred pages or so in though i started to see what a shrewd eye for character this austen woman had mr collins was the first person i marvelled at his character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass from that point on i found much to love about this book i was so into it by the end that i was laughing at some characters sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few in short i was completely absorbed  in conclusion i must now count myself a fan of miss austens novels and not just their fim adaptations and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future emma anyone this book is quite possibly the most insipid novel i have ever read in my life why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me it is  pages of nothing the characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because i became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied and the plot is nonexistent as though austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didnt like each other but in the end got married the story really probably could have been told in about  pages but austen makes us slog through  pages of mindnumbing balls and dinnerparties i dont care what anyone says this is not great literature this is a snore where my massive crush on jane austen began alone on a hot day in montana cursing her name  i had to read it for ap english and i could not see the point girls need to marry girls cant get married girls are sad girls get married girls are happy  i went to school to half heartedly discuss it and waffled and wavered in an effort to please my teacher finally she said was it good or not ben  no it wasnt  thank younow read this twenty pages of literary criticism for homework  twenty pages of literary criticism later i was hooked once you know what to look for its hilarious once youre keyed into the contextual life of women you have to feel for the plight of the bennet sisters and laugh at the crudity of their mother and mr collins  so yes im a guy and i love jane austen you got a problem with that huh huh do you huh well if you do ill be over here nursing my dorkiness just waiting for a fight for the honor of my beloved jane austen was a brilliant writer  this story is timeless  simply beautiful can you believe elizabeth and darcy invented the enemies to lovers trope and have been the most iconic power couple to exist ever since it is official now everyone on the planet has read this book i was the last holdout and being the last person excluding those who are just being born now i am sorry i didnt like it more i knew going into it that i was not a jane austen girl i had read two others and thought them bloodless and mercantile but everyone said to me well you havent read pride and prejudice is why you dont like her which i thought might be valid but its not because i still dont care this is not the greatest love story of all time its more like the most amiable alliance of compatible feelings that ends up in a mutually agreeable union and merging of fortunes and temperaments i mean really this book needs heathcliff to come barreling in on a stallion all wet from the moors to ravish all five of these daughters and show them what a real man is all about now theres a love story  chapters in i want that to sink in for a moment ok  chapters in and nothing has happened i am enjoying her writing style very much but i also enjoy the back of an occasional cereal box so that may not mean much we will see i am sitting here eating a tootsie roll a halloween left over and i cant help notice the similarities between it and the novel pride and prejudice first off like p and p the tootsie roll wasnt one of those dinky ones that you can almost swallow in a single bite so you know that ive been at this for a while and now that i finally got it down i have to wonder why i put it into mouth to begin with secondly tootsie rolls are a throwback to another age there are far better candies out there and the  wrappers littering the floor will attest to this you have to really like tootsie rolls to appreciate them i dont pride and prejudice is the dullest most wonderfully written book that i have ever read i read it simply to get a feel for the authors fantastic ability at arranging words and really i mean it when i say oh what wonderful blather i give the book one star after  chapters there is nothing that happens there is barely a story to the story at least not one that could be remotely interestingeven to people who like romance in the age of bodices there is nary a one that is ripped open let alone one that is undone with the gentle exploring fingers of a lover and then there is the hubbub over the booksatirical a witty comedy of manners sure i smiled a few times at the only funny character in the book mr bennett but overall i read studied the sentence structure noticed the wall paper and waited patiently as the paint dried even the dramatic ending where lizzy gets the guy is a letdown and dull just to let you know i was joking about it being in any way dramatic which brings me to the characters other than lizzy they are all stereotypical and lack even the most remote concept of depth jane is pretty and sweet from the first page to the last the mom is overbearing the dad aloof other than darcy no one grows or changes in a book that spans a few years and endless pages normally i use one star for books that i just cant finish and if i wasnt an aspiring author i wouldnt have bothered to get through half the book but since i did and when i compare it to yawner like a tale of two cities i had to bump this one up a notch ps dont read moby dick either if you know whats good for you another flashback saturday i chose to reread one of the best classics and my favorite jane austen novel  and finally this is also last day of mercury retrograde  this year i may have read at least five different retelling versions of the same book and i didnt enjoy any of them so i decided to go back and refresh my memories of course i can rewatch the adapted series and sigh when i see colin firths charming face on the screen which i did it at least  times but now im listening the audiobook and i have to admit i always admired rosamund pikes acting skills and her narration performance is incredible i highly recommend to listen this remarkable classic from her lyrical voice  so here are my favorite quotes i want to share  there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense  a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment  i must learn to be content with being happier than i deserve  and of course this one you must allow me to tell you how ardently  oh fitzwilliam darcy thats why you keep stealing so many womens hearts for centuries pride and prejudice jane austens most famous novel the story of a man with five unmarried but attractive daughters from the oldest to youngest jane elizabeth mary catherine and lydia  in regency england

the th anniversary of the all time classic a wonderful amusing charmingly warm story about never giving in to expediency but follow your dreams no matter how remote the possibility of success sometimes you wake up and it becomes reality eh just okay basically a character study of th century england society courtship etc nothing all that mind blowing or enthralling happens in fact not much really happens at all  i know some out there love this one but it wasnt really for me to tell you the truth i read this because i have pride  prejudice  zombies sitting on my shelf ready to go but i figured it would be best if i familiarized myself with the source material first well i finally finished this classic novel by jane austen set in the th century and i have to say it was worth all the time i took to read it i absolutely loved the main characters the humor and most of all the romance i watched the movie and loved it also but the book is much more detailed and descriptive definitely a favorite i highly recommend it to everyone you wont regret reading this one  the most overated book in history of literature the plot borders between meaningless and trivial  i was forced to read the book in th grade english class this was perhaps the most tedious school assignment ive received to date for several pages a lady remarks to a man about what wonderful handwriting he has not exactly gripping material the entire book seemed to be about hormonedriven marriageableage creatures trying to outwit each other in word and on the dance floor  the book itself is bad enough but to complicate matters women pledge allegiance not only to the book but also to the gazillionhour movie i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that it had begun  this was mr fitzwilliam darcys reply when ms elizabeth bennet asked him when he fell in love with her  pride and prejudice by jane austen had put my left out dictionary into good use i have to admit i was very slow in the first pages however nearing the end i was like a driver going at mph eager to reach the finish line  at the first pages i have to admit i was frustrated for jane austen had called her characters miss bennet and i must duly mention that there are five miss bennets and the use of various nicknames confused me more i thought elizabeth and eliza and lizzy are different persons so i put a book guide into good use as well  i must also mention my despise of mrs bennet i hated her more than anyone in this novel she has no talent in being a mother whatsoever and have no notions of leading her daughters in the right path the only thing that matters to her is the marrying of her five daughters after the misfortune of lydia running away with wickham she was frivolous as to forget the elopement as soon as news of marriage were ensued she considered the hunting for a wedding gown the most of her problems ive never seen a woman as fickleminded as her and no one as blinded to riches than her nor do i have a desire to meet one  lydia bennet is another matter she is selfish and insensitive as anyone can get i have to mention this to unload the hatred in my chest  how jane and elizabeth turned out to be well bred is a wonder considering the type of mother they are born with  but enough of what i hate of the book because it will soon be forgotten and all but the love of mr darcy for elizabeth would remain  this is a genuine love story ive fallen in love with mr darcy he wanted to change his ways for his beloved elizabeth he helped her in so many ways and he needed no credit for it for him it was enough that he knew he helped her he also hid his love for her for so long its endearing  no part of the book was useless all were vital for the fruition of mr darcy and ms bennetts love story as you go deeper in the book all pieces come together like a puzzle slowly making meaning  indeed ms elizabeth bennet is lucky to have loved and to be loved in return despite the troubles their love had to endure it was victor in the end  it is a truth which i would like to see universally acknowledged that no one voluntarily reads any th century novels unless they are by jane austen i fear that modern readers think all these radcliffes disraelis eliots gissings and so forth tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt them or even that they are most disagreeable horrid books not at all worth reading they look at them without admiration at the library they tell me they are all too long but for my own part if a book is well written i always find it too short but it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first lest it be considered prejudice such perseverance in wilful selfdeception in vain i have struggled to tell them about thackeray dickens and bennett it will not do somewhere they have formed the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i firmly believe that moby dick is the last book in the world that they could ever be prevailed on to read the modern reader is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who is either a vampire or a zombie is sure of being kindly spoken of well well one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other my idea of good company is the company of clever wellinformed dead people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion jane austens pride and prejudice is one of the most widely read classical romances it is also no exaggeration to say that pride and prejudice is the most popular work by jane austen one is amazed when one thinks how a novel which was written centuries ago have enchanted generations of readers and continues to still enchant millions of readers but those who have read it at least once will be able to account for why it is so  this novel though widely loved does not escape from the criticism of being overrated this criticism is to me is found on a misconception pride and prejudice is merely misunderstood as being a simple romance the reason for this misconception is its resemblance to popular romantic fiction but if one reads it with care and attention one will not fail to understand that there is much more into this work than being a simple romance since love and marriage are dominant themes of the novel it is perhaps natural to dismiss it as simple romantic fiction but other equally important themes such as duty honour domestic felicity and class difference elevate the novel from the simple romance pedestal however what makes this novel extraordinary are the use of diverse characters and the detailed exposition of their virtues vices values and principles jane austen is well known for her power of human observation this power is well exhibited through the characters she employs in her novels and it also accounts for her characters being felt real and close to the readers hearts  in pride and prejudice we meet an unusual heroine for the regency period elizabeth bennet is an uncommon individual she is bold outspoken intelligent and independent her character is quite a contrast to the passive and submissive heroines of popular romantic fiction of the regency period elizabeth is far too modern and she appeals to modern readers her lively spirit enables readers to connect with her instantly darcy too is an uncommon hero he is not bold daring and forward gallant type found in popular regency romance but rather he is steady intelligent strongminded and principled i think the contrast of the main duo of the novel to the accepted notion of heroin and hero of the regency period helped this beautiful novel to maintain its universal and timeless appeal  the rest of the characters are drawn from the silly ridiculous vain coquettish wicked proud and indifferent lot these various traits of the characters add variety colour and comic relief to the novel  the title pride and prejudice is said to denote darcys pride and elizabeths prejudice however in this fourth read i felt that both are proud and prejudiced elizabeths prejudice does not awaken only from the general manner and behaviour of darcy but also from her wounded pride darcys pride prejudices him against the people below his class as unworthy of his attentions it is fascinating to read these two governed by their pride and prejudices consciously and unconsciously fight their growing attraction  the writing is beautiful though not imbued with the victorian rich language and verbosity the light witty exuberant and passionate writing arrest the readers heart and her style of writing is most extraordinary jane austen tells her story not in so many words but through the description of thoughts and conduct of her characters the theme of love is expounded on the thoughts and conduct of jane elizabeth darcy and bingley domestic felicity and the consequences of its absence on the conduct of the bennet family the class difference is on the thoughts and conduct of darcy lady catherine and elizabeth duty and honour are mainly on the thoughts and conduct of jane elizabeth and darcy it is nothing short of sheer brilliance  i have written a pretty lengthy review here my excuse is that i wanted to try my best to do justice to the one book which will always have a tender place in my heart the one book which made me fall in love with classics as a child i owe my love for classics to jane austen and pride and prejudice and so i thank jane austen with a sincere warm heart welcome back to another edition of tim has an unpopular opinion and this is a big one as tim is about to state that he frankly dislikes one of the most popular books ever written  yes i dislike pride and prejudice ill be honest the only reasons it gets two stars is because of its historic influence on literature and the fact that it made me laugh on a few occasions all from dialogue by mr bennet who while a flawed character was a joy to read i dare say it would have been a  star read had it just been about him sitting in his library tired of his relations and trying to get out of the story by mocking all of them  i just dont get it dont get me wrong i understand its influence and i respect the people who love it but i was bored the entire time and dont get the love for it  abridged recap of the book lets go to a party lets visit someones house oh my now they are visiting us what fun oh no drama and gossip elopement scandalous oh hooray a visit that visit went poorly hopefully the next will be better huzzah it was  i guess if i was trying to compliment it further i should note that it is a rare example of a pure character done right jane is the annoying see the good in everyone but is actually able to see ill she just doesnt want to it hurts its not stupidity but a form of self preservation this is refreshing as usually in th century literature their purity just shines seemingly from stupidity  sorry everyone i know this is a loved classic but all i can say is that at least ive crossed it off my list of ones to read it is at this point that i must just assume that austen is not for me though i at least did not despise it like i did northanger abbey i dont know what to say about pride and prejudice because ive read so many reviews by readers who adore it i cant match them in any way  i can only contribute that the book is deceptively complex the themes of pride prejudice class family and marriage playing a big role in shaping this story  please excuse my lack of ideas this novel is the work of a person with such a strong mental fortitude that my words of praise ring hollow to me jane austen humbled me with her perception she is such a fantastic writer  this is what happens when you write not to please everybody disney take note you bastard my first  star book of the year whats that mr darcy doesnt want to dance at the dance  welcome to almost any th grade dance you will find most of the boys playing basketball in the gym while the girls are waiting in the cafeteria for someone with whom to dance  i was rooting for mr bingley to get away maybe he just isnt that into jane  the scenes bounce from one scene to another so quickly that it makes my head spin and i couldnt connect with any of the characters  elizabeth spends most of the novel sitting around complaining about mr darcy and mr bingley while doing absolutely nothing to better her situation at least jay gatsby did something about his love  my personal childhood reread challenge for april  ok im not much of a classics reader in my teens i bought two jane austen books to read pride and prejudice and emma i started first with pride and prejudice i remember finishing it and liking it but not loving it  i admit i felt more or less the same way this time i know easily this is a  star book for many its written beautifully and with such wit i opted for the audio this time and it was narrated nicely by rosamund pike it was entertaining this has turned into such a classic romance storyboy mr darcy and girl elizabeth bennett meet but dislike each other at first glance its the regency period and girls are looking for rich husbands to provide for them but elizabeth also wants love its a magnificent story that seems to be copied in many a romance book and still stands as the most romantic story of all time im not sure id personally give it that merit though but its still a lovely tale  now heres the interesting thing about reading the two jane austen books that i remember i read pride and prejudice first then emma after i finished reading emma i clearly remember thinking i liked that one more i know this is an unpopular opinion but now i must read emma and see if this still rings true for me i heartily enjoy period romance jane austens particular style of writing however leaves me a bit cold  its a rule that writers are supposed to write what they know if austen stayed true to that rule i really feel bad for her because she must have known nothing but shallow selfabsorbed slightly idiotic people  while the sisters bronte were capable of creating characters that even todays reader can identify with complete with passion and realistic heartwarming flaws austens characters are devoid of any depth whatsoever they all just seem to be flitting through life with one goal in mind for the men finding a woman whos easy on the eyes and for the women finding a man whos heavy on the bank  now ill concede that austen was technically a good writer but that doesnt mean her stories were interesting engrossing or even slightly entertaining in fact i found that i had to force myself to finish pride and prejudice and was fueled mostly by a deep resentment and anger for having even started it in the first place if this is how it begins i thought to myself how pissed am i going to be by the end  the answer pretty pissed  i made the mistake of reading this book after watching the  movie version starring keira knightley big mistake while the movie was sighinducing with its romance the book reads like a th century womans guide to bagging a rich husband the final scene where darcy finally proposes to elizabeth was something i was looking forward to with cautious trepidation cautious trepidation that ended up being wellfounded two people bartering over a used car would have been more romantic listening to pride and prejudice while doing a puzzle and drinking tea is perhaps one of the most old lady things i have ever done but i have no regrets  i first read pride and prejudice back when i was about  to prove to myself that i was mature and sophisticated instead i spent more time looking up what certain words meant than actually enjoying the story surprise early th century language is quite a bit different to todays english once i got past my initial confusion i enjoyed it i then watched the bbc series adaptation and found myself liking it a lot more no it wasnt just because of collin firth as mr darcy  i finally bit the bullet to reread it after my mum did so for the first time and wanted to watch some of the adaptations with me i was a little nervous because of my rocky experience the first time round but this time i decided to borrow the audiobook from my library that was a great decision as it prevented me from interfering with the flow of the story to look up random words and instead get immersed hearing the accent and just someone read it out loud really helped to make me connect with the characters and the setting if you are similarly intimidated by classics i would recommend trying out an audiobook of them  overall this was such a warm cozy read that i can finally understand why it is so well loved and been made into countless movies and tv shows i cant wait to rewatch the  and possibly  version with keira knightly i am also kind of intrigued by pride and prejudice and zombies is it good if you have any opinions on the adaptions i would love to hear them and maybe binge some i loved this so much more than i thought i would cant believe its taken me this long to finally get to it but now that i have its time to watch alllll the adaptations mwahaha i had forgotten just how witty this novel is and how key reticence is to the plot in particular elizabeths in stark contrast with her mother who shoots off her mouth at every opportunity with a vulgarity that constantly has one squirming on elizabeths behalf elizabeth is like the family editor the family censor its her who receives most of the critical information in the novel and very rarely does she share it i often found myself puzzling why in an age when women were largely silenced it seemed odd that elizabeth voluntarily silenced herself but it also made me keenly aware at times of how much human nature  or maybe female social decorum  has changed when elizabeth finds out why bingley has dumped her sister she doesnt tell her sister im pretty sure all of us now would be on the phone to our sisters in a jiffy clearly austen didnt find this a strange decision in fact she breezes over the disclosure so swiftly its as if she assumes the reader would perfectly understand elizabeths motive without any explanation maybe elizabeths extreme reticence was a plot device a very effective one to be sure because it enables darcy to remain mysterious and it even enables elizabeth to remain mysterious to herself its super clever of austen to refer to darcy as proud throughout the novel when in fact its elizabeth who is the more entrenched culprit of that emotional stance its largely her pride that creates the atmosphere of prejudice around darcy  its also a novel that makes you miss being in love as much for all the anxiety embarrassment keyedup second guessing girly gossipingspeculation and ghastly selfconsciousness as the elation and wellbeing  in short i loved it again and found it didnt matter one iota that i knew what was coming only brilliant writing and craftsmanship can sustain dramatic tension when you know what is going to happen next  as a footnote when i was seventeen my mother told me i needed to develop the elizabeth in my nature and curb the lydia thing is the lydia type has more kudos now than she had in austens time psychotherapy would probably argue for a balance between the impulsive lydia and editorial elizabeth as a model of behaviour you sense austen held a similar view  this was my second book by jane austen the first being sense and sensibility when i read sense and sensibility i found that i liked it but wasnt blown away by it and given the fact that i now remember absolutely nothing about it it didnt leave much of an impression on me going into pride and prejudice i didnt know if it was going to be like that too so i didnt have very high expectations additionally i did read an adapted version of pride and prejudice for kids when i was little and i remember enjoying that but that was a watered down version written in very plain english  fortunately i enjoyed pride and prejudice a lot more than sense and sensibility i loved the storyline and plot initially i feared that i might get bored but i was throughly engaged throughout the novel there was always something of interest happening the short chapters also helped because it made the book go by very quickly im actually impressed that i finished this in less than a week becau
The Diary of a Young Girl,honestly i just cant do it i cant bring myself to finish the book ive tried three times already and each time i have been forced to put it aside books and film about the holocaust are fascinating but not this one unfortunately i was not engaged and found i couldnt care less ill have to try it again in a few years  on the up side i firmly believe that anne frank had she survived the war would have grown up to be a marvelous best selling writer at the age of  her words are better than that of many modern day famous authors maybe the first thing that most people would get shocked is that i rate with only  stars one of the best selling books of the th century and now st century too and even more a book about the holocaust  first thing that i learned about this book is honesty  anne frank teaches us all about honesty about telling what you really think and so i am doing the same  for starters i wonder how many people really i mean really read the book because to rate with  stars a famous book that everybody tells you that its a book that all people should read and then they got in this commnunity for readers and maybe they feel the compromise to make the rest to think that you really read the book  if not the case hey i dont see why anyone can be offended by this comment and its true i dont see either anyone who will complain since to me it would be only a defense mechanism behind their own guilt of really not reading the book but making the rest that they did  i didnt think about this scenario but commenting about other thing with a reader friend that thought stuck in my mind  i invested so much time in that because one has to be honest the book is tedious since its not really a novel its a collection of diary writings without a coherent line of constructing a story even you need editors further notes to know what happened to the people in the secret annex since obviously anne was unable to tell the final events  so since its so tedious i wouldnt be surprised that some reader tried to read it but at the end they just rated with  stars to denote that they are cultured readers that they appreciate the book as one of the most important books of the th century  between the passages you learn a lot of things the first thing that surprised me its how this diary collection that it was written in the s in holland by a teenage girl almost anybody can relate to the comments and you dont feel them as outdated  sometimes if you read an old book you sensed the outdated of the prose selection of words etc but here i didnt feel it this diary could be easily being written in present time and i dont think that it would change at all i think that it was one of its strengths since i am sure that it will be as relevant for many more time  other thing that surprised me a lot was how much anne frank and by association the rest of the group in the secret annex were informed about the events in the war i know they had a radio but from stuff that i had read about wwii there were certain elements of the information that people werent aware  i mean at many moments they denote a certainty that jewish people were murdered in the extermination camps of course if you call them extermination camps of course you know that people got killed there but thats a term used by me now they called them labor camps and so far i read jewish people really thought that they will receive baths when they were really gassed or burned to death and its kinda logical thing since if they were so certained about their deaths there would be riots on the ghettos to flee in mass and they wouldnt march without protest to the gas chambers and the ovens even allied forces used espionage methods to know from nazi prisoners what was happening to the jewish people on the camps  anyway also there are elements like the assasination attempt to hitler that they were aware that it was made by their own generals i dont think that kind of stuff would be informed so easily since it was a clear fact of how divided was the opinions of the high ranking staff of the third reich  i am not saying that the diary is not authentic as some dumb people commented that the holocaust didnt happen  the holocaust happened  it was real and we never forget that to avoid that it would happen again i am just commenting that surprised me how well they were informed about key sensitive info of war events taking in account that they were a bunch of people living hidden for like  years in an isolated annex of a building  i know they got visits by the people that helped them but even so i am not questioning its authenticity just expressing my surprise when i read it there were other things here and there that i was surprised by the use of terms like diet low fat geez i didnt know that in the s they used terms like that in the s were like the rush of healthy food but again i supposed its the effect that stuff that we think are new they are just recycled and labeled as new  i am amazed that this book is banned in some schools okay there are comments relating to sex and sexual preferences but so what if a teenage girl from the s can think about stuff like that while she was isolated with a war outside dont you think that teenagers of today can think just the same  i think that books like this one can help them to know that they are not alone that they are not weird for thinking things like that that was normal in the s and its normal now too  i was amazed that the group tried to live normal i mean kids making school work and so i think that in such extraordinary circumstances they needed to do extraordinary things like to make circles and to talk in group and hearing all about topics i mean they were like trapped and living together really too close in the sense of physical space and yet nobody cares about what anne thinks or what she has to offer geez sure they need to be really still and in silence usually at day but they should like making a tribe i dont know i am babbling but to try to live like regular families was evidently wrong for the sanity of their interrelationships  what didnt surprised me were behaviors like trying to hide food or keeping money from the group in times where the group work were essential to survive the human selfishness risen as a second nature  resumming i just want to explain that my rating is based on my entertaining experience while reading the book and the format of the book itself  and this didnt have to do with my respect for the subject of the holocaust and its terrible events  there really isnt anything i can add that many other reviews havent already done its a five star read because it is important because it is real and because the holocaust is something we should never forget the problem with diary of a young girl is that its the diary of a young girl and young girls are like young boys kindof a pain in the ass its like  pages straight of no one understands me i guess the reason this made it on to so many high school curricula is that young people might relate to it and clearly some of them do because they wrote pissedoff comments below this review  but this doesnt depict the horrors of the holocaust night does that this depicts the boredom of being locked in an attic for two years and frank is very bright but not bright enough to make great reading out of a kids diary  in the pantheon of literature about being locked in an attic flowers in the attic is still the gold standard while her story is sad the naked emperor cult around this book is unmerited  the key quotation about people being basically good at heart is absurd in the light of the story and from a theological perspective just plain wrong this is an autobiography based on anne franks diary even today after  years this book is widely famous among us  what makes this book so special well this book was never written to get published or even that someone will ever read it for that matter if you write a diary entry you must be familiar with the unfiltered raw and original emotion behind writing it  as this was not a planned book so there is no unexpected twist but this book is worth a read please dont presume it to be a sad story anne frank was a very jolly person which you can see in her little stories that she shared every day with her diary kitty i was so amazed to notice how a teenagers writing can be so strong and thoughts can be so clear it inspires me that even after so much chaos and fear around how positive and hopeful she was  actually i wasnt going to review this book at all since i read it way back in the seventies and if i remember correctly did not finish it  but yesterday just for the heck of it i went through some onestar reviews two things i noticed immediately  most people disliked the book because it was boring and anne had a sanctimonious attitude they were of the opinion that the book became a classic only because of historical reasons looking at it dispassionately i have to agree  i was even more interested in the negative comments on those reviews most people were angry at the reviewer because they had the temerity to criticise anne a holocaust victim for gods sake whatever be the quality of her writing the consensus was that the author was a saint and therefore above any kind of criticism this viewpoint seems to me rather silly  anything published for general consumption is open to both positive and negative reviews  the second most common comment was that this was the diary of a teenaged girl and never meant to be read for its literary merits  and i do agree with this those who criticise based on the quality of the writing is missing the mark i feel as with any diary its primary merit is as a firsthand account of an important period in history  i read it when i was roughly annes age i could visualise for myself the claustrophobic nature of their apartment and i wondered at a regime which forced a certain section of its citizens to hide themselves in fear of death this was my first serious exposure to holocaust literature and it built in me a passion for history and a lifelong antagonism to fascism of any kind  this was an important book in my life this book was fascinating i was a little surprised that there wasnt more about the atrocities that were happening around them instead of all the turmoil in the household however i realize that she was just a very young girl and i was surprised about how sexually aware she was until she and her family went into hiding she hadnt had a lot of worldly awareness so she wrote about what was happening around her and that was everything that went on in that household with those people it would be hard to imagine how i or any other person would react under the same circumstances i tried to imagine what it would be like to have to be totally quietnot to be able to even move around at all for several hours or not be able to use the bathroom when you needed to i thought what would happen if you had a cold and were coughing how could you control it after she would write about her feelings when certain things were going on inside she would put a small notation about what was happening in the world outside they would get news from the outside from those who were hiding them another thing that surprised me was the gifts they would give each other on their birthdays i would have thought that those things would have been rationed and not be available i guess if you had the money and apparently they had quite a lot the regular germans could still buy things everything i have previously read about that time period indicated that even the nonjewish german people had very little she talks about being able to make jam from strawberries that were delivered to the warehouse that would take lots of sugar apparently the factory that they lived above was the factory that her father was a partner in and they made pectin there so maybe the delivery of sugar wasnt suspicious or maybe that was what made them vulnerable however someone had to have turned them in or they would never have found them behind the bookcase in the annex  i felt sad that her relationship with her mother was so bad i think had she live that relationship might have been repaired with time as it appeared to be mostly misunderstandings combined with her adolescence also her relationship with her sister wasnt good either her relationship with the other family was understandable considering the close quarters they shared it has occurred to me that the jewish people are a very gentle kind of people therefore enabling them to live under those circumstances for two years i think it would be almost impossible for most people to live like that i cant understand why anyone would turn them in to the gestapo knowing they would be going to their death most of their german christian and catholic friends were wonderful people who actually put their lives on the line to protect these two families i have never heard who turned them in  they almost made it anne lives on just as she wished i would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reliving the past with anne her family and friends  if only every teenager would read and embrace this story i wonder if it would change the instantgratification mememe society that has evolved over the last  years of course this novel is a staple in any holocaust lesson planning in a world in which so few teenagers or adults for that matter seem to stop and give thanks for what they have instead chirping about what they want or complaining about what they dont have anne frank faced the most unfair of cruelties with a certain strength and grace that crushes nearly any problem kids or adults face many holocaust books or movies make you think why why did this happen this story makes me think how how did anne frank find the strength to keep her head and record her thoughts during such an unbelievably difficult time in a world desperate for heroes and tired though indelibly enamored by spoiled athletes stories like this are onceinalifetime hats off to anne frank she had dreams of becoming famous and although it was for reasons she never would have imagined at least that part of her dream became true i appreciate how this story makes my students of all learning levels and backgrounds rethink what they thought they knew about sacrifices and challenges and even gets some students thinking about how they can use their lives to make a positive difference for others anne frank the diary of a young girl spoilers  amazing this was one of the few times i felt so close to a book hero theres definitey a spot in my top for this one  i always get sentimental when i read about all these sinister things nazis did to inmates at concentration camps but this was something completely different there are no scenes describing the tortures those people suffered in this book we a get a taste of the life of those who were the fortunate ones and they were clever enough to go into hiding and continue their lives seemingly safe until the end of the war yet page after page entry after entry we become aware of the fear the terror those people experienced even when they managed to evade the enemy i could almost hear my hear pounding every time i read about the bangs and noises they heard thinking they had eventually been caught i clenched my teeth whenever anne described the nightmarish hours they spent silent in the dark listening to bombs destroying the last drops of hope they had left  so this book doesnt describe the nazi atrocities what you actually gain is a deep insight into a young girls psyche through the pages of a poorlywritten albeit fascinating diary which was kept while anne and her family remained hidden in a house for  years in their effort to escape nazis after reading the first  entries the reader immediately begins to realize that anne has an extraordinary personality during her first year in the annex we see her struggling with the adults as she is constantly being criticized for her insolent behavior she experiences extreme loneliness and a desperate need for love and affection i was pleased to find that she remained remarkably forthright throughout the whole narrative as her story unfolds we see a child growing gradually becoming a woman which was another pleasant surprise towards the end of the book her entries become more lucid more introspective and full of selfcriticism which shows that anne has changed she is more mature and far more selfaware unfortunately this is where you begin to realize the end is close  addressing fellow readers i understand and agree with most of your comments yes anne was too young too frivolous her writing was deeply flawed but please remember that this is a child we are talking about a child who spent the most fruitful stage of her life confined to the walls of a house in order to survive a child who had to relinquish her dreams of freedom of feeling the sun on her skin of completing her studies of becoming a journalistin order to stay alive this was not a novel written for recreational reasons it was a persons diarytheir private thoughts enjoy it because sadly we were not given the chance to read any more of her stories i just wish she had been given the chances we are given she would have become an excellent writer  her optimism taught me a life lesson and i think this is the main reason why this book will stay forever in my heart an excellent read i happened to read several diaries and almost every time i didnt get rid of this feeling  how honest can you be after all with yourself in a journal that you know will be published a diary which is and is not just yours  what percentage can we imagine associating the life of the character in the pages of such a diary  with the real reality  pretty much i think but not totally any diary also leaves room for projection for fictionalization well that wasnt the case hereanne in the amsterdam hideout writes only for herits the only way out anne writes to herself with the double  kitty reading the pages realizing that you are reading literature which this yearold girl is able to do naturally reviewing the documentary of the nazi invasion of the netherlands the feeling created is one of bitterness kitty is anne and anne would die anne writes anne has observations and an ambition that make you feel small that make you to be ashamed of your old diaries reading this book  youre feel at the same time so small and so big in front of what we call history life the yearold girl synthesizes and overcomes a reality in front of which many adults would break their hands in agony hysteria despair which happens under her eyes at the same time it seems useless to me even a snobbery to judge this text literary to interpret it its all a macabre drama of which only his father otto frank survived annes diary becomes the bestknown testimony of a world war ii jewish victim this diary is shoking it created the feeling of watching a death live a death on credit like as you go to a movie and no matter how much you like the character you know it just as well that its just a projection of you that hes going to die very soon ive never had a harder test of what i read like in this book this book was awful i hated it and thats all i have to say about it it feels weird giving this book a star rating and i am extremely late to reading this one weirdly i never had to read this in grade school but as to be expected it was both deeply profound especially in context of what comes after her diary ends and surprisingly mundane i mean mundane in that ultimately anne frank was a teen girl writing about her lived experiencesshe just happened to be in an unusual extreme situationbut that doesnt mean she is not also focused on things like maturing crushes bodily changes family angst and more i was surprised at how little the book focused on the outside world and the war but in looking back it makes more sense that shed be focused on the world around her ie her family and friends hiding in the annex its hard to say if this book is enjoyable or not but thats beside the point its an incredibly impressive feat for such a young writer and it obviously had a huge impact that she could never have possibly expected for that its worth reading and remembering i looked around goodreads before posting this review to make sure i wouldnt get yelled at  this book is worth reading but not for the reasons you might think alex is correct in that night is a better book in terms of its representation of the horrors of holocaust centers but what makes this such an interesting read is precisely that it isnt about those horrors or at least not directly this is a voyeuristic look into the psyche of a bright and socially observant teenage girl whoeven admist the horrors of gas chambers and concentration camp internments that were taking place offscreenwas still but a teenage girl with daytoday insecurities which often took precedence over the imminent physical dangers that she and her family were subject to the entire time the diary was being composed the dichotomy of these two concepts is where the true horrors lay in my opinion anne frank i was also reminded as i neared the end of the diary a remark david used occasionally to make about abandoned internet blogs in that theyre a bit depressing one moment the author is blogging away sharing his opinions and ideas as dumb as they may be with no intimation that the end is nigh in another moment its overno closure no explanation of why the blog was abandoned and certainly no where are they now vh followup special reading annes diary was a lot like this we all know what happenshappened to her and yet there it is againthat discomforting found footage feeling of knowing that its over because well it ended for real  dont read this book to try to gain an understanding of the genocide that occurred throughout western europe in the s read it because often times the scariest thing about life is that you can never entirely hide from its terrors even when you lock yourself away in an attic for two years i read this a month prior to going to visit the anne frank house in amsterdam netherlands and getting to actually see the space that she frequented along with her family and others  i can say it was quite an experience if you dont feel something while going up and down the narrow stairs and passageways then you arent getting it youre not allowed to take photos inside and i think thats perfect  the memories will be there for a long time that in itself is better than any photo you could take i give this book  star because its real story i feel so sad for these people who died and suffered at the war because of hitler i hope they in heaven now  the afterword of this book is a part where youve known in your heart from the beginning what would eventually happen to them but when you really read it its still such a hardtoaccept truth and the questions that what did they do to deserve this kind of treatment and why were so many innocent people have to experience this fate because of a war will be stuck in your mind forever i admit that i avoided this book for quite a while put off by its imposing fame this was a mistake anne franks diary deserves its popularity  what struck me first was how wellwritten it was frank received her diary at the age of thirteen shortly before her family was forced to go into hiding from the very beginning however the diary is charming quite naturally she possessed what many experienced writers struggle to develop a voice it is not an easy thing to make oneself heard with just pen and paper for frank it seemed as effortless as breathing she comes alive in these pages  not to belabor the point but as somebody who both aspires to write and who attempts to keep a diary i was deeply impressed it is one thing to write well for others to produce something great after much revision but to write so well purely for oneself with no audience in mind and at such an early age it is humbling granted franks personality came to the aide of her literary talent unlike so many writers she was quite extroverted she keeps her focus on the doings and events of those around her rather than wallowing in her own thoughts which admittedly she does do from time to time this helped to turn what could have been an illegible record of petty frustrations like my diary into something that often resembles a novel  under any circumstances then i think that frank would have been an author worth reading yet of course she was not living under just any circumstances as a jew in hiding from the nazis her diary is also a remarkable historical documenta window into an atrocity she ably captures the terror of living in hiding but also the annoyance the boredom the loneliness and the longing as well as the moments of hope love silliness and fun  of course all of this is seen through the eyes of a teenager though at times strikingly mature frank is very much an adolescent in these pages and can often be petulant and childish yet this is not a criticism indeed though i have the great privilege as a teacher to work with teenagers nothing in recent memory so powerfully brought back the feeling of being an adolescent than this diary it was enlightening to vicariously relive this tempestuous phase of life  it need not be said that this diary is ultimate a tragic document the thought that such a bright and blameless girl could be so senselessly murderedit is heartrending to consider and hers was just one of millions of tragediesmore visible perhaps but not any more senseless or horrific i do not think i can offer any moral or consolation only the hope that many others read this diary as well as other firstperson accounts of historical atrocities all of this really happened and might again as a historical text its incredibly fascinating and definitely worth the read but its not really a book you take to the beach on holiday like i did  i have studied nazi germany for the past  years so to read this from the perspective of a young girl was really interesting and quite eerie  if you are interested in the history surrounding the diary then id recommend you read this but if youre expecting a gripping exciting book then you may not be for you in my opinion  i dont regret reading it but it wasnt quite as i expected i feel like i would have enjoyed it a lot more if it wasnt for the mass hype surrounding it which is a real shame people seemed to have bigged it up to be something i didnt think it was regardless im glad i read it and it did make me think because i cant even imagine having to go through what anne went through  a truly intriguing and heart breaking read like most of us i learned who anne frank was back in grade school however until now i never read her diary i sometimes got so lost in the pages that i forgot i was reading a memoir from history reading this diary is like opening up a floodgate of emotions its hard reading this knowing its not a work of fiction but something many people had to go through i find it important for anyone to read this to educate ourselves about what has happened in the past every single image that i had formed in my mind i remember as freshly as when i had read it years back countless times i felt claustrophobic and outofbreath mentally living inside the hidden backside rooms where anne and her family stayed even when i recall it now i feel im running out of breathno windows the one highup window that is referred to in one of her letters to her diary afforded barely enough light for an exchange of air or natural scenes  when i had first read it i had felt like the whole story was a talk between myself and another girl of around my age both with very different livesmine open and free with free food varied delicacies and fresh air and hers blocked from sunlight kept hidden lest they be puffed into gas chambers but the conversation was happening because the story was an epistolaryi became the listener and she the speaker  her description of discovering her femininity and the first sparks of amour collided with mine hence i genuinely regard this story as a onesided conversation with a friend whose life was tragically cut short  i read what happened to her once the nazis stormed into their hidden room and stripped them off to the death campsanne was severed from her parents and left to die in bergenbelsen due to typhus and starvation  what really does one do when they are listening to a friend who is slowly being paraded into a life flattened off colour to be finally snuffed into lonely unjust death  its so unfair what happened to these holocaust victims like literally it is beyond words of compare when i read the diary of anne frank for the first time i identified with her at every turn i felt her emotions i understood the plight she had with her mother funny how this time around decades later i identify more with her mother as children we expect our parents to be perfect as parents we keep the secret that we are still children just older  friday  november   none of us really knows how to take it all the news about the jews had not really penetrated through to us until now and we thought it best to remain as cheerful as possible every now and then when miep lets out something about what has happened to a friend mummy nad mrs van daan always begin to cry so miep thinks it better not to tell us any more but dussel was immediately plied with questions from all sides and the storiea he told us were so gruesome and dreadful that one cant get them out of ones mind yet we shall still have our jokes and tease each other when these horrors have fasded a bit in our minds it wont do us any good or help those outside to go on being as gloomy as we are at the moment and what would be the object of making our secret annexe into a secrete annexe of gloom   if a  year old girl can keep a good attitude and look on the bright side of the holocaust after being forced into hiding then i can surely look on the brighter side of things every day of my comparably easy life my reasons for not liking the book i know many people feel that this is more like a life altering book for them but thats truly not the same in my case   the book is more like hardcore history which has never been my choice of subject   i personally did find the book rather dry as its major gossip written by a girl whose family is in hiding during world war ii   im  and i guess ive grown over a book like this   although i do agree some i repeat some parts of the book make you smile but if you ask me i wouldnt suggest this one as its not one amongst books of my choice reading preference knowing the true and tragic story of anne frank this was a book i was eager to read the book covers her familys period in hiding it deals with regular exchanges of the family including conflicts due to the stress of being shuttered since months there are some references to the political situation with words of hope her personality as an outgoing and intelligent person who loves to write comes across well the stress of living through very difficult times is clearly evident as she describes the long period the family was in hiding since she has planned it as a diary capturing her thoughts with long records of every day matters in a book form it is not entirely engaging thoughnevertheless an important writing from an intelligent girl whose life was tragically lost i think i put off reading this for so long because i was just a little bit afraid of the emotional impact it would likely have and rightly so im not going to rate it how do you rate someones life poured out to you the life of an intelligent vivacious articulate young girl whose only concerns shouldve been about boys and school and such a life snuffed out before it had a chance by a madman do i recommend it everyone should read it as a reminder we have short memories after all this book changed me in so many ways  anne was such a beautiful writer  she vividly showed her story  i saw a vibrant live story of real people who experienced these things  it was such a masterpiece of a story and anne i felt a connection with  this story will forever stick with me  this book is a story of life  anne and her familys  everyone else involved lifes  just bc anne stopped writing and we know what happened after it shouldnt take away from celebrating the lives that were lost  carrying on the story so they will never be forgotten so theres this picture black and white an old old man leans against a wooden support beam in a shadowy room its an empty room with a rickety looking dusty floor that seems like it might give out at any moment theres a dilapidated set of sm
Animal Farm,all animals are equal but some are more equal than others  in the start i thought this book would be from the view point of animals about how they are treated how they expect to be treated and how man is cruel towards them but but but i am amazed at how orwell criticizes the political maneuvers and totalitarian rule using animals to explain what humans do the author beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started from just the face of power is changed this book tells how the ruling class makes fool of the working class uses their energies and resources for their own pleasure what happens behind the closed doors of power how the working class is being brain washed that they are happy and satisfied and free despite of the obvious slavery they have been undergoing my favorite character was benjamin yes a donkey  who remains a neutral throughout and says nothing despite understanding everything a huge applause to orwell for being able to explain human psyche political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story a perfect book people will still be reading this in a thousand years time when communism is just a footnote funnily enough i read this book as a child and thought that it really was about animals i remember thinking evil pigs im glad youre bacon in my world and poor hardworking horsies come live on my farm instead you can have all the hay and makopa you want sadly no apples tropical climate  i reread it after education spoiled my natural inclinations for fast and absolute punishment of evildoers and eternal rewards for the good i do find it pleasantly strange that these animals are symbols for political stereotypes and yet people still appear in the book isnt that crazy thats literary perversion in a class all its own  im thankful i read this in my formative years before i had all this intellectual baggage emphasis on baggage piano on the intellect because i got to appreciate it like a child would almost like the way i appreciated charlottes web to me back then it was just another story about animals albeit a wordy one with no pictures  which is probably why i still experience a certain righteous thrill when eating crispy bacon update after my february  reread  a lot has happened in the world since i read this in high school in the mids the book is as interesting and powerful as i remember however i think having an adult perspective on life government laws taxes rights etc makes this a much more powerful for me now than it was when i was a teenager  one of the great things about this book too is that it is not very long i think that morality tales with political undertones can be daunting if you know you are dealing with a page book this tells a strong tale in  pages or so that is easy to read but difficult to swallow an allegory that is a must read for all  i will also say that this book has an ending that i remember as being wow but not super shocking as a teenager now it is absolutely terrifying  it gave me chills  original review  one of the best  no doubt so much symbolism and meaning crammed into such a small book also a great use of anthropomorphism i just wanted to use a big fancy sounding word  review wise that is about all i need to say  it is great read it  but i will add this anecdote     i read this when i was in high school as required reading most required reading books were long and not all that exciting i am looking at you jane eyre but this one was so good that i couldnt put it down and since it is so short i read it in one night well the teacher had assigned chapters and asked us not to read ahead still hard to believe i got in trouble for reading too much of a required reading book im sure this book was very good when it came out in whatever i could check this but warning  i am going to spend this review being as annoying as possible to a certain group but its way way better now  in whatever time of the th century this came out during this was thought to be written in opposition to stalinist russia thats fine whatever not exactly a hot take for a white guy from the western world to be antiussr  but nownow its abundantly clear  if it werent already obvious that this book is written about how bad totalitarianism is as opposed to being specifically about communism take a look at the world around us then check it against orwells political views then come back to me  a certain political faction of evil morons in my certain country i live in take a wild guess likes to call certain things the ones that are against them orwellian  nonwhite people entering your country orwellian having to be nice to others and not call them slurs orwellian the idea of people not appreciating your opinions and thereby being antifree speech even though that is not what free speech is orwellian  ignoring the fact that the very idea of their using the word orwellian to serve their purposes is far more well orwellian ill just come out and say it because people on the right dont know how to read they havent ever actually really thought about or analyzed either this or  so they assume that george orwell is on their side  the prorich getting richer and antipoor not being poor side  but my dear conservative friends orwell was an outspoken democratic socialist from top to bottom  so maybe pick one of the copious number of farright classic authors to support your dumbass point  oh there arent really any to be found  bummer maybe next millennium  i read animal farm when i was in college and it was one of those reads where you think its going to be boring but it turns out to be a favorite its an allegorical tale representing the russian revolution where the characters in the book represent people during this time  i wont go into the plot too much but in a nutshell this story is about a group of farm animals who rise up against the evil farmer who cares for them they basically take over the farm by cause of old major marxlenen the pig all about change he gets all the animals together into an uprising against mr jones the farmer tsar nicholas ii the animal characters then run the farm themselves and develop their own hierarchy being lead by snowball trotsky and napoleon stalin in a way the story reminds me of an aesops fable because the animal characters in the book have human characteristics and there are morals and messages that are quite obvious young readers can read it and they wont pick up on the meaningtheyll just think its a story about a group of rebellious farm animals against humans but i believe the message that orwell wanted to express is that power corrupts also that people need to think for themselves educate yourself and make your own decisions dont let others think for you  someone recently asked me who my favorite character was in the book which is a really difficult question to ask in my opinion i liked a handful of the characters including boxer snowball benjamin and clover but if i had to choose a favorite it would have to be snowball snowballs ideas were in the best interests of the animals and he was always fair he wanted to educate the other animals and make life easier for them he was intelligent brave and stood up for his beliefs which is why hes my favorite character in the book  im not sure exactly how old my edition of animal farm is because no publication date is given however goodreads seems to have this signet classic published in  this thin paperback is in great shape for its age with clean crisp pages i first read this in grade  and decided it was my favourite book i knew a reread needed to happen right away but it took me four years to finally get around to it when my boyfriend gifted me this beautiful illustrated edition animal farm is a book i often think about and often quote and it was a bit nervewracking to go back to it to see if it actually lived up to everything i had built it up to be thankfully im thrilled to say it did  in many ways its a little bit underwhelming the second time around because the plot which lots of people will already know because its a retelling of the russian revolution is extremely simplistic this meant however that i was able to focus more on motivations and symbols and the other meaty stuff outside of the plot which dont get me wrong was still hella exciting  the big question is this still my favourite book yes ive not yet read a book that so succinctly and simply drives home an idea with wonderful intricacies and nuances after all this time i also feel so comfortable with this book i get it and love talking about it and see reflections of it all the time also in response to this edition i loved the illustrations they were sinister and childlike and felt like political caricatures  i think orwell would like them apparently andy serkis is going to be making a film adaptation of animal farm and im super jazzed that doesnt really have anything to do with this review but i wanted to share my joy  finally thank you to greg for gifting me this pretty book reading it aloud with me over facetime and letting me go on big rants about why benjamin is the worst communism theocracy fascism capitalism neocolonialism neoliberalism always the same piggy style  although it was mainly aimed at russia and the sowjet union because they at least tried to establish a socialist communist workers utopia just like china and other states in south east asia and around the world the fact that it always failed is something so multidimensional that it would blow the complexity of this review throughout the book cover and im not qualified too so lets better say that each system has its flaws and that coincidence big history and geopolitics influence the rise and fall of theism and totalitarianism  all animals are the same but some are more equal especially apes love this idea to look at fur gender religion political or economic ideology skin color tradition clothes etc to find something that differentiates them from others as a legitimation and reason to exterminate them or at least first exclude stigmatize discriminate enslave and then commit genocides on them ironically some dictatorships like communism at least didnt try to kill all black jewish muslim catholic etc people but just everyone who disobeyed although im not sure if this really is an advantage in contrast to fascism communism could simply kill so many more people in russia china etc because they had much more time to do so so judging by the numbers one could say  that the kill count counts but how should one know which numbers are correct because often nobody counted or was killed for trying to do so colonialism under authoritarian dictatorships aka monarchy fused with theocracy torture terror killed an unknown number of people fascism killed at least something between  and  million people communism killed something between  and  million people capitalism neoliberalism and neocolonialism killed an unknown number of people in all exploited areas with billions of citizens by not helping them to develop and stabilize and guess what i would bet that each avoidable death within the last decades now and in the future could reach the levels above another western derision after centuries of colonialism now rebranded as neocolonialism under the neoliberal economic nobel price agenda nobody can say how many people are dying after unimaginable suffering each minute and most disturbing no media or politician cares or talks about it its just too taboo to touch this connection with a pitchfork because of the implications and because of manufacturing consent crushing everyone who dares to speak out   evil intelligence no matter which farm animal ape or human tribe the clever and ruthless sociopathic males will always try to dominate for more power resources sexy ape girls and influence all of human history could be seen as a permanent struggle with the megalomania of superpowers which have at least been somewhat tamed by democracy and capitalism but even there are huge differences between the libertarian free us market and eco social europe  orwell simply later modified the same concept for  or one could assume wrote a prequel  is the same with fascism and humans instead of pigs and communism and of course also the more famous one because it showed the direct consequences that are normal everyday life for many people around the world  no need to enter misantropic mode there have been incredible improvements in the last  years and social evolution has become a peaceful revolution in many states especially scandinavia   my all time favorite example of a perfect balance of state and economy of eco social politics and a controlled market on the other hand there are of course also states backlashing and thereby failing in africa south america south east asia and the southern us but with the never ending hope for enlightenment education and distributional justice one can imagine a brighter future for them george orwell leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination this is a blatant political statement theres no reading between the lines in order to ascertain the meaning its all here on the page after around page twenty it was very obvious how this book would end history repeats itself and in this case it goes full circle nothing changes and a wise old donkey was the only one in the piece aware of this we can presume he has seen it before though on a character level he was a bit of an ass not to tell anybody what was coming see what i did there im good i know  the problem i had with animal farm is that i could not engage with it the characters arent really characters the setting isnt really a setting and the plot isnt really a plot they are all mere devices a means for orwell to blurt out his political statement the entire book is one big author filibuster an entire situation and a group of characters created for the simple reason of showing orwells opposition to communism and more specifically the stalin regime its cleverly written and it is funny at times but such direct authorial intention took something away from the reading experience i couldnt lose myself within the writing  the pigs were used as an insult to mankind their leader napoleon aptly named slowly distances the pigs from the animals of the revolution they begin to take on the traits of humans and after a few chapters they have set themselves up as the thing they originally usurped they become corrupt and driven by money and profit theyre above their peers ultimately destroying their own aims by doing this orwell is calling humans pigs he is calling postrevolutionaries pigs for me reading this this was more of an insult to pigs than humans pigs are lovely animals nicer than humans the metaphor certainly relies much on the readers interpretation of what a pig is  thats me just being pedantic and silly but i guess i just like pigs and i feel like ive read animal farm before i feel like i know this story and thats because it is the history of mankind it is the history of revolution so needless to say orwell has captured a large sense of this on the page when it has been read it is definitely something that cannot be unread the allegory is pertinent and in a sense an almost pessimistic truism though the inner romantic in me finds such a defeatist attitude well defeating  its undoubtedly very intelligent writing but i just didnt enjoy it when i read literature whether it be poetry play or novel i like imagining things i like coming up with my own interpretation meaning or criticisms with this orwell has said it all i feel like i didnt need to read it a plot summary would have given me everything the writing did  this book didnt read like a classic at all for me it was so easy to get into the writing style is simple and amazing its short but the story is relevant and weaved in such a way the readers get lots to think and reflect about the working system in a society especially the political system  this small book made me think about the class division and the different caste systems that are still relevant today the political system is seemingly complicated but this book gave me a glimpse of it in a way how its being played the part which intrigued me the most was the way the common people being manipulated or played with false promises and a better future for them and that the lives of the ones who rebel or do something different for their betterment ends up not appreciated this small book gives a very clear picture how the actual society works a vivid description on how the heirarchical system works and will continue as long as the general public blindly keeps on believing that others are going to make their lives better by helping them reach and sit on thrones who will detect them on how to work harder so that such people can party better  the part which hit me the most was when one character who worked their whole lives for everyone else ended up as being forgotten and left to their own devices when weak and old with nothing much left for them in the end  this book represents well the society we are living in gives us an idea how the political system works in real and how the rest of us play our roles in the system  the best part of reading this book is that it makes me think about how i as a person play my role in the society how important one vote of mine matters and plays a significant role how i am ultimately responsible for my own efforts in making the surrounding around me improve and how ignorant i am regarding the ways of the society and the political system its just not enough to live who is going to stand up for us ultimately its not them but we ourselves lets start by thinking twice about how easily we believe in the words others promise us for our future is it them who we are lifting them making them stand on the tip of our heads or us whos going to actually decide for that under the leadership of the pigs the animals of manor farm overthrow their human owner and go into business for themselves with all animals doing their part however some parts involve a lot less work than others and things quickly change  i somehow managed to dodge this landmine in high school and the ensuing couple decades however i had a few conversations about it at work and decided it was time to give it a read  animal farm is a dystopian tale of revolution and the ensuing government according to everyone its an allegory of the russian revolution of  however it could easily be an allegory of every revolution ever meet the new boss same as the old boss  the revolution happens fairly quickly the pigs organize the other animals and send farmer jones out on his ass after that the future looks bright for about fifteen minutes then the pigs start maneuvering against each other and fucking over the other animals theres also scapegoating lying rewriting history and all sorts of things no government today does that was sarcasm before anyone decides to chime in  this is a powerful little book with many messages power corrupts communism doesnt work those who dont know the past are doomed to repeat it people are dicks  there are some classics that are as dry as a geriatrics vagina and pretty joyless to read other classics are fairly easy reads containing a wealth of wisdom animal farm is firmly in the second camp in todays uncertain political climate it is definitely a must read although it may be a case of closing the barn door after the horse has already left five out of five stars animal farm is a dystopian tale of revolution and the ensuing government that takes over afterwards it could easily be a symbolism of most revolutions that occur in history a new leader comes in and its the same as the old leader rinse repeat  note to self must not get too political with this review  i absolutely loved this book and the tale of this animal farm should concern anyone that believes in a freethinking society all it takes is a revolution distrust in facts listening to false propaganda of any new administration and not questioning the slow changes that occur that gives government total control over personal freedoms and liberties  animal farm is a simple tale but its well written and holds many timeless truths its a story of power and the absolute power that can corrupt any type of democratic society  george orwell was a flippin genius to write this tale just read it it terrified me and it should terrify you as well not as formidable as  this modern day fable though bears down hard on socialism and even more on the very aspects of our nature that brings power struggles about  first published in  this allegorical criticism of stalinist communism is nonetheless still relevant today as a cautionary satire on totalitarianism in general what more can anyone add about this much read and appreciated modern classic every time i read this despite knowing about the allegory and the real message being shared i still find it hard to think of anything but the animals themselves  a mark of the authorship of orwell in keeping to the story and not writing animals as humans theres only so many books that should be compulsory to read but surely this should be in everybodys top   out of  this little book whose title sounds like an unpretentious little childrens tale is one of the best political fables ever written the humor elegance and simplicity of orwells writing contribute significantly to the books success allowing him to tackle political and historical issues with great finesse and understanding without making the reading unpleasant quite the contrary it is easy to recognize the different social types behind each animal species on the farm this boxer is beautiful and touching representing the peasantry irreducibly faithful to the chief who abuses her without scruples we also see specific political personalities clearly behind certain animals such as lenin behind old major stalin behind napoleon or even trotsky behind snowball the internal dynamics of the small revolution had also presented quite convincingly thus orwell arrives with astonishing ease at the end of his proposed political criticism he recognizes the inherent selfish wickedness behind capitalist ideology and prefers a more just and honest form of socialism but on the other hand he will always oppose the ideologies of left and right because their extreme opposition is never more than an illusory appearance in reality they are two paths that lead to precisely the same point of bestial inhumanity it is extraordinary how current this book is for the modern day russian situation and not only  it left a powerful impression on me even if i knew all about the plot and message before starting the book i thought and i was right that i should do some research before reading this book regarding the russian revolution stalin strosky in order to understand the historical context in which the book was written  i believe this book should be read by everybody as it is perfect allegory about the dangers of power how socialist ideals are so easily corrupted and how dictators can transform into capitalists i can think of some current examples the most heartbreaking characters the horse boxter represent the uneducated masses that are so easily fooled to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the leaders that reminds me of all the brainwash that is done in the communist countries and not only animal farm is an extremely famous book with a powerful political message that many of us read as an anecdote of the real communist movement taking hold in russia essentially the story is a parody of communism from the bolshevik revolution to the soviet union under joseph stalin beyond the obvious we can see that this is a tale as relevant today as it was in the s after the romanovs were removed what changed for the average person the novel illustrates george orwells incredible foresight when he first published his book in  we can package a revolution and a new beginning with glorious expectations but as sure as theres an eye on a goat felt an appropriate pun it will all revert to the same old power system just with different faces names terminology and supposed ideology there will always be a system that incorporates boxer napoleon and squealer all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others looking at our current world with issues of racism xenophobia religion immigration and the richpoor divide we are always creating a separation between those in power and those that assent those in power end up selfserving and those that serve are fed a false narrative diet of misinformation and conspiracy  i found the book an excellent fairytale story for children it is a fascinating dynamic fable at a fundamental level where we can love and dislike the different figures and teach children the rights and wrongs of behaviour gradually you can use it to explain the history our society and how relationships operate within friend groups workgroups social groups and nations it is however a very deep analogous expos of how those in power use that power to keep the majority distracted subjugated and obedient while they manufacture benefits for themselves  animal farm is a bucket list book that everyone should read and i highly recommend it what a book it is kind of confusing to read a story about animals who speak and stuff many people say that you need to know about the russian revolution to be able to read this but nope this book is full of symbols clues methaphors how can you notice them well just read the story why did orwell choose a pig as a main character and not a lets say butterfly or a pigeon or a cute dog or a rat about the story despite the characters are animals they behave like humans they even dress like humans while you read it it gets worse and worse not in sense of quality of course but in sense of sadness recommended absolutely the book is kind of heavy though so you might not understand it at the very beginning but once you get into it and you associate some history to the book everything fits i read this in high school and hated it because it terrified me  it still terrifies me  read this wow everything about this was so clever i think my mind just exploded  around the year in  books challenge notes  a classic with less than  pages i absolutely loved this book it wasnt boring to me at all i think orwell did a great job of symbolizing all the injustice that happens in name of an outside force and how simple minded people who do not educate themselves get taken advantage from be it west for soviet russia america for iran or terrorists for the united states my thoughts in a nutshell there are so many scary and deep thoughts about our society the most frightening part of the book that orwell wrote it more than  years ago and it is still true im totally speechless i really adored that orwell wrote it as a children story but it is more than a little tale it is pure sarcasm and truth about our civilization this book only  pages kindle edition but it is so powerful i truly love animal farm and i think everybody should read it george orwell is a genius the creatures outside looked from pig to man and from man to pig and from pig to man again but already it was impossible to say which was which  all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others the mantopig metamorphosis is wellknown since odysseus met circe but the opposite transformation works equally well probably more equally well than the other way round considering the privileged equality of pigs  one could almost get the notion that pigs and men are interchangeable and somehow it is hard to know beforehand which species would be more equally offended by the comparison  i reread animal farm today for professional reasons and i was surprised how much i still appreciate it after several decades in a way i could argue that it gains truth each year in the same way  moves into the realm of reality from a darkly funny dystopia but then again we all know that truth isnt truth so i must be mistaken on that if memory clashes with modified truth it is memory that must be faulty  animal farm is of course a satire describing a very specific era in history the corruption of the communist revolution under stalin but that strikes me as less important than the fact that orwell created archetypes of human behaviour that manage to transcend the original setting and cross the border of time and space to move into our contemporary pigly power play  who doesnt find an equivalent of a vindictive napoleaon urinating on the brilliant plans of a rival only to steal them afterwards  who doesnt recognise the type of narcissistic leader who offers himself all available honours while crying snowball whenever something goes wrong  who doesnt know the herd of sheep who are barely capable of reproducing the most simple slogans but still dominate each meeting with their loud and braindead bleating  who doesnt know the hardworking honest horse who refuses to let disappointment break him down until his life is completely spent under the yoke  who doesnt know one of those cynical donkeys who see the world for the depraved place it has always been and will always stay  were all there in the animal farm and we share muriels confusion when she reads the commandments which seemingly prove that her memory is wrong all animals are equal but some are more equal than others brutal truth in a world that has discovered the most powerful sword there is to guide humanity aka piggity the written word if you control the word you control the world that is the true teaching of animalism pigism and sheepism are just variations on the general theme  the one thing that made me laugh out loud in sheer pleasure was the attempt to form a reeducation committee for the wild creatures you cant tame rats and rabbits why is that such a good thought there wont be any rabbitism or ratism just rabbits and rats doing what their wild nature leads them to do  im with them for sure  all animals are equal is the original commandment  when the farm is still ruled by the cruel and alcoholic mr jones once he is overthrown and the animals take over the farm the clever animals slightly modify the slogans to suit their own needs for instance now they say all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others these more equal animals are the ruling pigs in the book  a few pigs who oppose them are wiped out the ruling pigs modify laws no animal shall kill any other animal without cause without cause is the modification to the original slogan which the pigs add to remain ruling pigs  what interests me about this book and also about orwells  is the constant refrain by the reviewers that orwell wrote this book against communism against the soviet union this could possibly have triggered ideas in him but to dwell too much on it and claim that the book is against communism is insincere false and misleading he just had human beings in mind when he wrote animal farm  it is a powerful book both in content and style it is amazing to see how the animal world mirrors the human world  no matter how much we try to distance ourselves and put the blame solely on communists in the book the pigs in particular not only mirror human being they become them and then we see how these animals when having absolute power spawn new knowledge systems and act cruelly the pigs destroy other animals though claiming to be their saviors  while benjamin a donkey and boxer a horse remain my favorites i guess even the powerful pigs like human beings all over the world when reading this book will most probably make similar claims in such an atmosphere of cruelty unleashed by the pigs on other innocent animals and thinking of the climate we live in today i admire the cats as they are shown in the book i also understood the vain horse who leaves the farm sometimes or perhaps always even though it could have terrible consequences one should avoid becoming pigs and donkeys if one can do so  in the book for instance pigs would not have become the pigs if the majority of animals were like cats allegory does not only act like an allegory in the book it becomes real urgent like the world we inhabit orwells rage must have been maddening but it is fascinating to see how he reigned his rage in the form of a book i wonder if in todays world someone can write  or animal farm or even can one distinguish between the modernday pig and the benjamin it is depressive to see the modernday pig pretending to be benjamin modernday benjamin might work for others by day and later have drinks with the pigs to make sure that some animals remain more equ
The Little Prince+A8,its the perfect fableits a timeless classic when i think of my favourite booksanimal farm is among the first to come to mind  the cast of characters is memorablethere is the pig napoleanthe leader of the revolutionwho turns into a despotafterwardsthats stalin then there is snowballanother pigwho is coleader of the revolutionbut soon has to fleehe gets blamed for everythingthat goes wronghe is trotskythe soviet dissident  there is benjaminthe wisecynical donkey there is boxerthe workhorsethe true believer in the revolution he is the hardest workerand yet is deemed all too disposablewhen he gets old the dogs are the secret policethe apparatus of repression old majorwho dreams of the revolutioncould be karl marxor lenin and animal farm itselfcould be an allegory for russiabefore the revolution   animal farm is the ultimate critique of totalatarianisma book which also serves as a warning against the dangers of violent revolution and its also a memorable descriptionof a dream turned sour we are all children in adult bodies yes we are dont think we arent for one moment the fact that we were indeed children is a huge part of each of us it is possible to shed a few appreciative tears on every page of this book if you entertain the thought that the pilot is the little prince maybe you wont think thatmaybe youll have your own take on the bookthats the magic about it this book is translated to english from french if you understand andor appreciate french the deliciousness of that fact can affect you in addition to the sweet storyline itself the book wont even take you a whole day to read consider honoring the little you that still remains and resides within you and read this salute to childhood to innocence and to you it just takes a little imagination and bravery   great observations but personally i think its overrated it practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you dont get it its your own fault because youre a grown up and only kids can see what matters its heavy handed clumsily executed observations on whats important in life its not wrong by any means but its kind of pseudointellectualist  im going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot because its more fun that way  a man crashes his plane in the desert hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons invents a history for him finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration as he rehydrates his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him   ready for the moral its really simple it is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important or in other words spend your time developing relationships dont worry so much about the things theyre not important its the time you spend and how you spend it that is  thats a nice philosophy i get it i even agree with it one hundred percent i just think these metaphors are painfully clumsy sometimes i fall into a mood where i am simply tired of life where i just want to crawl under the duvet with a cup of tea hug a book and never let go the little prince is that book for me its a truly special treasure its precious its my rose this book was just as lovely the second time as it was the first and almost as great in english as in french  not sure if i can write extensively on this book its just so lovely and wonderful and it really seems like one of those books that reveals another facet with every reading  lovelovelove this one the little prince is the one book of my childhood that truly wrecked me wrecked me irrevocably  it is the one story that i swore id never read again  i didnt i hadnt i never read it to my son either  then last week my middle child my oldest daughter discovered the  film of it and came to me sobbing and said mommy youve just got to watch this movie its so beautiful  i did i watched it it was a good movie but as usual they added parts they took away parts they created violence where it wasnt necessary etc so purist that i am i marched into the library checked out the book and told my girls if youre going to know a story then learn the original version  my hands were shaking this weekend as i cracked the cover to read it and the first thing i did was read the backflap where i was reminded that the author himself went missing a year after the book was published in  i immediately pictured antoine de saintexupery in his little airplane crashing somewhere alone in the mediterranean sea pretty disturbing if you know the premise of this fictional story the tears started early  i dont know what it is about these desert stories but they wreck me every time i have never cried harder than after watching ralph fiennes in that red airplane flying over the desert in the english patient or after meeting claudia in moon tiger and realizing what she has lost what she will never find again in those desert sands  the desert seems to magnify desolation naturally by its isolation it can be a setting for great reflection great stories and even greater loss and it is here in this desert setting that our crashed pilot meets the little prince whose life experiences illuminate almost every important lesson we could learn in a lifetime  of course i was crying again but in a good way  i could just sit here adding quote after quote from this book on this review i could advise all men that everything they need to know about women is available to them in the passages between the little prince and the rose i could advise all parents of young children that this is one of those rare books that reminds you how precious and fleeting your time is with your kids  but language is the source of misunderstandings and id be better served to invite you to crash in the desert yourself see if the little prince shows up to speak to you see what he has to say it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye  i plan to read the little prince since many time ago and i was aware that it was a quick reading but still i hadnt do it yet until now  i went to the cinema theaters and i watched the new animated film about it and while i hadnt read the book i watched the film and i loved it i was aware that it wasnt an exact adaptation per se and then i knew that it was about time to read the book  it was a quick reading it took me like a couple of hours wonderful book the little prince is a metaphorical and surrealist journey where a rose isnt necessarily a rose a fox isnt always a fox a small planet isnt a small planet all the time  all those things and more that you can find in the book they will be whatever you need to be you just need to recognize what will be the rose what will be the fox what will be the small planet  and then and only then you will be able to realice the power behind of this cute little book  this this is the right time to revisit your favourite books it just feels like meeting an oldtime friend just what we all need at the moment it really made me feel so happy to reread this book again i have limited time and i try to focus on new books and since we are asked to remain at home as much as possible i thought this would be a great moment to reread this book the little prince will always remain my favourite there was a magazine called imprint now defunct during my childhood in india it used to publish literary articles and stories my father got official copies and he brought them home regularly one issue contained this story and he gave it to me for reading i was maybe  at that time  it left an indelible impression on my mind i was sad for the little prince and his proud rose and constantly worried whether the goat would eat it i chuckled at the silly grownups on the various planets following their inane pursuits i was sad when the fox and the prince had to separate after he had tamed it and i broke down and cried at the end  i read this book again after a long time and suddenly realised that i had become one of those adults on the asteroids i was still sad after reading itbut now the sorrow had a deeper meaning it was the death of childhood that i was reading about  this book is an absolute treasure for a kids story this one has rather heavyhanded intentions embedded into quite a sophisticated system of symbols that exists to produce a strong  emotional effect like voltaire in micromegas antoine de saintexupery plays with sizes  scales meddles with the allegorical and even plays with time he knew like an astute psychoanalyst precisely which images to use to convey the mere representation of mortality le petit prince is the everyman who has a deep passion somewhere inside of him and only with childlike wonder and awe he asks questions on top of questions no matter the degree of absurdity is he able to show us glimpses of it externalizing feelings like only a child can i find the goldentressed titular child a very peculiar emblem in the middle of the saharan desert an eerie living monolith almost an oxymoron when one comes to think of it so kids let me ask you this one are we just placed on this planet so as to remain forever alone in a grimy underground locked public toilet the little prince wakes slowly hes been out cold for hours hes bleeding from a gash on his upper arm he finds he is chained by leg irons to the wall there is another person sharing his predicament its a bear also chained to the opposite wall in the center of the floor is the corpse of what appears to be donkey in a pool of blood near the corpse are a gun a tape recorder and a saw  grownups are very strange said the little prince to himself sadly this is my seventh time to reread and enjoy the little princes thought provoking sad poetic nostalgic powerful emotional journey to the world  nearly  years later from its first release it still addresses to your heart giving its important social criticism messages and also it gives you hope about friendship childhood life thats why after all these years the book is still cherished by both adults and young generations  it was also great reflection of frances fall at the end of world war ii its time to build a new country that is rising from its ashes  anytime i join this adventure it makes you cry and smile at the same time which makes this book unique timeless lyrical extraordinary  here are my favorite quotes  and now here is my secret a very simple secret it is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye  the most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched they are felt with the heart  grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them  where are the people resumed the little prince at last its a little lonely in the desert it is lonely when youre among people too said the snake  if you love a flower that lives on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night all the stars are abloom with flowers a childrens book that is for adults a moral allegory too full of symbols for me it feels that the author struggled to include as many symbols as possible in as few pages as possible i do not agree with all of the authors ideas the repeteaded motive that grown ups are badwrong going nowhere felt rude also the little prince is quite annoying oh yes i am this evil i apologize to my friends who love this book for all that i am about to say this is the worst childrens book ive read since the giving tree yes the snake was chilling and the finale was lovely but the underlying ideas are so awful that i cant rate this any higher  heres my issue the problem with the world isnt that people grow up its that far too many never finish the job the romantic obsession with being a child isnt beautiful and it isnt warranted growing up is good maturity sets you free it is impossible to see the invisible without it and when you truly have it kings and vain men and drunkards and businessmen and lamplighters and geographers turn out to be as beautiful as roses and you dont have to tame or be tamed to love someone  it also really does not help matters that the rose is the only female voice conforming to almost every stereotype of the feminine i can think of off the top of my head or that the hero blithely continues on inflicting pain on those around him and this figures as wisdom that is it really the wisdom contained in these pages is poison  loved the snake though  this work is a philosophical tale on the meaning of life existence and human relationships children and adults alike will read it differently depending on their level of awareness this fact is why it is difficult to criticize each drawing its own moral its interpretation  what makes the little prince a unique introspective timeless universal and unforgettable masterpiece once you get over the hyped mystique and granduer too often hitched to this little book i think its not a stretch to look at it for what it is the more appropriate title should be how to train a little fascist aside from being obviously sentimental it was also a bit boring i refuse to let my kid read it oh this book the little prince has been my faithful and trusted friend since i was a child its amazing how differently i looked at the book as an innocent  year old to the adult who i am now the simple truths in this book are amazing i could quote them for days and days they are very philosophical and even though they are often overquoted it doesnt make them less true the illustrations are simple i reread this book at least once a year to remind myself to be as inquisitive as a child having read both the english and french versions i can say i love them equally in both languages  this book will always have a special place on my bookshelf to took me so long to figure this for myself sometimes we love books not because they are really good but because of the memories associated with them i think thats the main reason why i rated this  stars when i joined goodreads  dont get me wrong while rereading this book still put a smile on my face i just figured today that the reason was the memories had this been my first time to read this i would have rated this for whatever its worth also with stars i like this  i have always wanted to read this book as i have come across it in so my reading lists and was always curious as it was loved by so many  i have now satisfied my curiosity and i am left feeling very bemused on completing the story i am glad i didnt get the opportunity to read this book as a child as i think it could have put me off reading forever as an adult i just cant relate to it i get that the book is full of little messages but they just dont work for me and this novella was just felt a little too preachy but then again that may be the hardened adult in me  but i did satisfy my curiosity whats important is whats invisible  one of the cutest prettiest most interesting stories ive ever read  it leaves me wondering how can such a limited number of pages contain all this greatness oh boy i swear i dont do it on purpose im trying to keep an open mind and let popularity with high ratings guide me to seemingly interesting reads i wouldnt consider otherwise i truly dont understand how this book has over  million ratings its like some cruel joke people play on each other by recommending it to others  i was bored to tears i have an eyelid infection i was on board until the little prince showed up then it was the ultimate huh fest at just past the halfway mark i started to realize what this is its a book of philosophy geared towards small children the kind of book an adult would read and consider it good for their kid like some sort nasty medicine they need to take to get better yuck  its way too deep on a spiritual level for any  to  year to get why would they even read it in the first place its painfully dull theres tons of childrens books and television that combine learning with fun and jokes i guess this author didnt get the memo  lets say i believe that its meant for an elementary school kid to read as part of an excruciating assignment what is with all the talk of alcoholics guns and death im surprised the little prince didnt visit a planet where the only inhabitant was doing nonstop speedballs until he dropped much more heartfelt than your usual constructed new age mysticism but still falls to false separations and idealism this is achieved by the inclusion of representational figures which do not stand in allegorically but rather conceptually and hence become not pure symbols but a set of tools for the construction of different philosophical scenarios  the book also presents the requisite complexity needed for a holistic view of emotions and interaction but falls to the very french fault of the author or author surrogate declaring themselves entirely correct about points which warrant more discussion and thought  there is a fine line here between using such a representation to further thought by confrontation and trying to quiet it with thought terminating cliches the reader may decide for themselves when saintexupary crosses from one to the other  it is unfortunate that a staple of childrens literature is the stalwart declaration of comforting halftruths but this is not uncommon even in adult books most new age and selfhelp works are simply an extension of this to the ostensibly adult mind  unlike those myths of selfjustification the little prince occasionally presents some sense of wonder and mystery that overcomes the otherwise simple message its no carroll but there are times that it approaches that level of surrealism that opens a childs mind to something heretofore unimaginable  yet it is overall too selfsatisfied with its message of naive wonder and reassuring but empty specialness yes i know  i know this book is a piece of brilliance and it supposed to be everyones favorite but for me it is just my boyfriend husband and i are currently reading this in the original french as practice for his french classes and as i go through this little gem for the umpteenth time i am still amazed by the gorgeous simplicity of stexuprys writing and the charming  and heartbreaking  story of the little prince  its hard to review a book like that im not even sure if it really should be shelved as a childrens book because lets face it there is stuff in there that children will only truly understand when they grow up but that is part of the message of this book there are things we shouldnt lose touch with as we grow up  i laugh as i read some passages because i often dont feel like much of a grownup myself and just like the narrator i am highly suspicious of people who behave too grownup what i learned after i hit  is that most adults are still utterly clueless and are winging it just as much as i am so honestly who do those people think they are fooling i havent read many reviews that mention the fox but he is my favorite character with his gentle selfawareness and slightly wild wisdom  i only ever read it in french and i have no idea if the translations are any good if you do read french even at a beginners level its worth it my mother had a vinyl audiobook of it narrated by grard philippe that i recently got a digital copy of if anyone knows where i can get a cd or digital copy of that please hit me his voice brings the book to life in the most amazing way recommended for children grownups and pretendgrownups alike this is the best book ever written a child can teach you so much as well as adult learnings are brilliant everyone must read this book at least once everyone seems to really love this book but i had to read it for a french class and we were forced to discuss it in french and by the end of the unit we were all really annoyed with it this resulted in nearly the entire class holding a bonfire at the end of the semester where we gleefully tossed all of our petit prince tests and worksheets into the flames all the while shouting triumphantly try getting back to your home planet now this is why students should always be encouraged to read books of their own free will rather than having great literature forced on them see what happens  i get that theres a lot of symbolic stuff in this book and i dont do well with symbolism i read the book because i had to and by the end of it my only thoughts about it were what the hell was that about i was excited to get into this book because of its praise and was pleasantly surprised by the drinking allowed to occur within a childrens book the tale was worth reading and i see why someone would enjoy reading it to a child at its best the little prince encourages children to question authority and demand answers while portraying the adults of the world as confused but at its worst that prince was just an anecdotal part of a childrens book with less substance than i expected the part about the negro kings of africa was also slightly outdated and now here is my secret a very simple secret one sees clearly only with the heart anything essential is invisible to the eyes  i dont remember how old i was when i first read this book but i know i hadnt yet started school  not even preschool so i know i was around three by the time i turned four i was in preschool my mother gave me a copy of this and insisted i read it and i only remember hating it and that it made me cry  i added this in the early years of goodreads but between the years that had passed all i remembered was how much i disliked it and nothing of the story and knowing that so many people loved it i figured that at some point i would reread it  this was an audible telling of the story with narration by richard gere and haley joel osment  there are many other versions by many other narrators i loved the narration and the story this time around since i was so young when i first read this i can only imagine that giving me a story to read that begins with a pilot stranded in a desert didnt sit well with me as the daughter of a pilot  last year i read a review by my friend julie whose review further prompted me to read this sooner than someday and today was that day  the most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched they are felt with the heart  thank you julie this was lovely and im so glad i finally reread it
The Great Gatsby,after six years of these heated and polarized debates im deleting the reviews that sparked them thanks for sharing your frustrations joys and insights with me goodreaders happy reading this is an all rightish kind of novel i suppose but i always preferred fitzgeralds littleknown prequel the average gatsby although some people found the vision of mervyn gatsby jays obscure brother living a reasonably okayish life as the manager of a carpet and upholstery warehouse in des moines a trifle dispiriting i quite agree that the bad gatsby was a shameless selfripoff which did fitzgerald no favours the threesome scene between warren harding john dillinger and gatsby was in poor taste and i do not see how it got past the censor i have never been able to look at a set of deer antlers without blushing ever again and i must say that these new franchisedout novels like the late gatsby jay as vampire inevitable i suppose the grape gatsby must be aimed at the vegan crowd and the lesbian gatsby in which  surprise  he never was a man followed up by the straight gatsby  and the groped gatsby in which he was recovering from sexual abuse at the hands of warren harding  what can one say  the ingrate gatsby in which he doesnt get rich and is really bitter  must have literature fans gnawing each others kindles in sheer angst theyre a disgrace i have even seen a superhero graphic novel called batgatsby or did i dream that hmm maybe there isnt a batgatsby i wonder if it would sell i bet it would batgatsby the eh gatsby  classic yes the great american novel hmph so i heard i suppose it should make one more interested or at least feel more compelled to read something or reread as is the case here when it has classic and everyone else loves it stamped all over it and has a movie made out of it though what beloved novel hasnt these days of course i originally read fsfs gatsby because i was expected to for a high school english class so even though i was never the type to do homework i read the great gatsby because it had a neat cover fitzgerald is fun to say and of course the legend of zelda  unfortunately for meredyth my thoughts on gatsby  years ago are pretty similar to the thoughts i have on it today how pretty pretty decedant how drippy how zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  its not that i was completely uninterested its that my interest was never piqued to the point of really giving a shit sure who doesnt love a hot mysteriously wealthy man with serious heart ache for a serious material girl what about those rich dudes who may be crooks but no one can figger out how crooked they are exactly because how crooked can you be if you throw such mean hoedowns  oh and i love a good morally ambiguousprotaganistnarratorwhohatespartiesandsocietybutjustcantseemtostayaway as much as the next person but nick our hero just wants to be liked so very much and unfortunately he reads like a sap and when all the other characters are unforgivable bores i would prefer that my ambiguous socially mandated narrator manage to keep me awake  what about those three stars you ask well i cant lie i do think fitz had a way with words i did find that those subtle nuances of the variations in lifestyle during the depression to be very much in effect and i would be happy to visit any fictional small town called west egg or east egg for that matter and i get the kind of crazy he was going for in his more psychopathic character george wilson who because he was in love becomes the bastion of normalcy even when he is driven to murder and his own suicide  fsf did manage to be believably compassionate towards his seemingly less insane characters who are all on the brink of insanity but still made me drowsy there is definitely a part of me that sees how one could be drawn into the twinkly lit world fsf created supposedly out of his own reality and i have noted his passion for the beauty of the unfolding story such as it is  but i was disappointed  years ago by the storys inability to convince me it wasnt nap time its unwillingness to point out the the relevance of the individual over society and the irrelevance of the world gatsby inhabits and i was disappointed again this past week  in summation be sure to keep an eye out for this writer once he writes something more appealing to the masses hes sure to bust out onto the scene soon you heard it here first read as part of the infinite variety reading challenge based on the bbcs big read poll of   i am a classics person but not a modern classics reader i prefer the victorian and previctorian classics and modern classics have never really interested me however even before i began this reading challenge i knew that i needed to change that im still not overly enamoured with modern classics though they tend to be a lot shorter than victorian classics are which can come as a relief but i am thoroughly enjoying the journey through the genre  this book was quite a disappointment and not a surprise at the same time i knew i wasnt going to love it before i went in to it though i dont know why i had no preconceptions of this book ive never seen the film and i havent ever read a blurb about it my copy doesnt have one i just knew i wouldnt love it  i didnt think i wouldnt like it though i cant really think of any specifics i just didnt like the plot the characters or the setting at all there were some fun moments some dire moments and just a whole lot of dullness going around its hard to really enjoy something if you dont feel any sympathy or empathy with the characters not even mentioning that everpresent idea that we need to identify with characters too i also found that this book wasnt particularly american or particularly s or particularly anything at all really it was just a kind of story with a kind of moral to it  the one thing i will say about this f scott is a wonderful writer i kind of thought this before i went in but i never really knew until i found i was rereading sentences over and over again just to relive them not what they were saying or what they were telling or showing or portraying or anything like that but just the words used and in which order sometimes it felt like magic i will definitely read more f scott but this one really isnt great at all but thats okay most classics arent that great anyway we just pretend they are most of the time  the great gatesby fitzgeralds crowning achievement  the novel of the s and loved by every generation sinceerm well actually not so loved by me so not wishing to offend or come across as a heathen i think this needs a rereading by me but back in  when i read this i can still remember clearly thinking what is all the fuss about some rich dude and his personal obsession with some chick a look at decadence idealism change  a portrait of the roaring twenties im a like so  out of  boring boring boring started slow got slower speeded up a fraction mercifully ended if the story hadnt been so short id have given up before the end as the tedium of turning the next page is sure to have overwhelmed me well maybe im being a little harsh but i didnt like it im supposed to love this book its a classic its the great american novel as an english major im supposed to just worship every sentence of the book and praise its brilliance  i dont like it though i really dont in fact i downright dislike this book  i hate every character in it i hate the supposedly brilliant prose i hate the supposedly clever symbolism there is not a single thing in this damn book that i enjoy  but tim its a metaphor for the american dream and i get it of course i get it the symbolism is so blatant how could i not get it  maybe i should reread it how many times do i need to read it to enjoy it i read it in highschool i read it in college twice and read it again years later to give it one last shot im done with it may i never touch this blasted thing again  stars and a hatred that burns with the passion and fire of a thousand stars    unless of course gatsby is actually a green lantern who is staring off into that distant green light as symbolism for his secret identity he is also defeated by something yellow a weakness of all green lanterns maybe when hes off at the parties hes actually off saving the world with super powers brilliant  stars    no its not that fun back to the  this was a bookclub read that ive not read for many many years it was of course assigned reading in both high school and college i remember pouring over all the various aspects of this book and picking it a part like disecting a frog  now that im oldermuch older this reading broght a whole new light on this book for me and im sorry to sayi think this book is highly overrated  this book was never a sucess either critically or via sales when it was released and i think that it actually is far from the great american novel i think this is a case where years of reading into this book has made it seem more than it is  i hated the book discussion and kept silent through most of it while i listened to a few pretencious people spout verbatium the various things i learned when studying the book trying to sound knowledgable on what fitzgerald meant by this or that or the other thing  the bottom linefitzgerald is dead and ive not found credible sources from him as to what he meant so im left with analyzing this book with my own intellect and now that im old enough to think for myself and not concerned about the grade i will receive i find this book coming up short so why exactly is this unimpressive piece of cheap melodrama still glorified  labelled as the great american novel thank god this book is ended i never felt that much relief after finishing a book this is a nightmare for me i mean what exactly is written in this novel the great gatsby is considered one of the greatest american novels of the th century  although to be honest i dont care about its hype anymore i pick f scott fitzgeralds work because i thought it would blow my mind it did but not in a prominent way  i am not one of those readers who dnf the book but i thought at least three times to do that the book is so monotonous that it suffocates me the characters are ridiculous and the narration is all over the place with loose ends people have different opinions on this book for some people it portrays unconditional love it was plain dumb for me  jay gatsby and daisy love each other but she married tom because jay was away for some time and broke after five years gatsby returns with enormous property and wants daisy in his life tom has an extramarital affair daisy knows but doesnt care with the help of daisys cousin nick gatsby rekindles his love  now there are unnecessary details outoftheline characters who are selfcentered and egoistic everyone is dying and no one cares  this book is only  pages long but it gave me a severe headache i will never recommend this book to anyone in my life this book is horrible annoying and forces you to smash your head on the wall i just dont get the hype on this one then again i guess theres a reason why this book was unpopular and forgotten about for the first  years after it was first published personally it makes no difference to me that this is supposed to be an important literary novel as i like to make those conclusions for myself rather than going with the masses just because its the masses i found this book to be quite boring and rather depressing thankfully it was a short one day read i am willing to read another fitzgerald in hopes that ill have a different opinion by the way i found the explanation for the artwork on the cover of the book which i found on the internet to be much more interesting than the book mr gatsby come off it get a life she simply isnt worth it yaar yup three stars again i dont know why i thought itd be different this time this book is always ruined for me by the completely uninspired main character does he have a single thought within his head nope hes nothing but an outside observer to the frenetic chaos that rages all around him and because of this i always feel detached from the story and the drama surrounding daisy and gatsby  womp womp i wonder if there are retellings of this  wanders off  this review can also be found at the book eaters i feel like the great gatsby is essentially a series of awkward conversations followed by a series of awkward silences in the mansion of an ex lover or the next door neighbour  it rambles on going off on a tangent for no reason and all the characters are awful daisy is selfish and idiotic gatsby is a naive creepy stalker tom is an insufferable unfaithful misogynist  if this is an american classic i think ill stick to jane austen   definitely in the minority i think in this one in the words of emily fox its just not my jam  why is this so popular ive sort of comes to terms why this is one of the classics i seem to want to reread more than others even if i might like the others more the writing is very compelling its easy getting invested in the plot and the drama of the characters but i still dont enjoy the actual plot or any of the characters especially not gatsby but i think i need to read more retellings of the great gatsby a it has an enormous pull on me i keep thinking that gatsby and the main character could possibly be a good couple if done right   an interesting book to reread as i hated the book the first time around didnt like the characters especially not gatsby but on this reread it was quite an entertaining story not with likeble characters though but a decent book to pass some time with im interested to start reading more by f scott fitzgerald in  and im hopeful i will have a good time why havent i realized before how this is such a sad book is beyond me and i was very taken aback how i felt so bad for gatsby my heart went out for him  i feel the author wrote really well when telling stories of characters backgrounds but he was so insistent in describing the surroundingslightstreesetc and often times to me overdid them completely update about a week ago i received an email from a goodreads user about my rating and review of this book the user said that my review disrespectful and triggering and that i need to delete my account and ended the message with a death threat first of all i have no idea how they got my email in the first place second of course i deleted the email blocked the sender and blocked the user on goodreads  i honestly cannot believe that i have to say this but if you are offended by someones review of a book that you like you probably dont need to be on this website there is a blatant warning at the bottom of my profile that says that i curse in my reviews and that some of my reviews may be taken as too harsh so if you are easily offended please dont read my reviews or send a friend request  i wasnt even going to post anything about this but i just want you all to understand that if someone has a different opinion than yours it isnt a shot at you learn to stop taking things personally hell from what ive learned a difference in opinion can possibly be a good thing you see something that pisses you off just keep scrolling or unfriend me  i have deleted the review to prevent any further hate spamming from any user on goodreads  thank you for reading whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had  though it is incredibly overrated this is a good novel the great gatsby is a romantic and cynical novel about a group of new yorkers wealth and habits during the jazz age it is comparable to romeo and juliet in many aspects but i believe it is much more than a love narrative its also a musing on the hollowness of a leisurely lifestyle  the characters in the book are all flawed individuals who are difficult to empathise with but that is part of the books charm dont get me wrong i enjoyed it but im not sure why so many people regard it as the ultimate american novel  many people find the great gatsby sad because those who dream do not always accomplish their goals however the authors major message is that pursuing an unworthy desire will lead to tragedy not that dreaming will lead to sorrow  if only the rest of this story was worthy of such a great closing sentence as an exercise in writing the great gatsby is difficult to top the prose is exquisite the technique of how nick carroway is used to both act within and narrate the story is extremely well done  but the story the ohsolame story in the great gatsby disappoints on almost every level gatsby is a criminal unable to realize that the love of his youth has moved on in life you would think her being married to another man would be a clue daisy  well what positive thing can you say about a woman so shallow that she repeatedly chooses to stay with a violent cheating spouse because hes superrich tom is the violent spouse who gets super sad about plot twists involving his mistress which leaves nick a proxy for the reader who is fascinated and replulsed by the lot of them  every one should read the great gatsby once i suppose and not just the cliffs notes as i did in school does it represent the jazz age perhaps one small slice of it but i suspect even within that slicesay the attendees at gatsbys partiesthere would have been far more interesting stories to tell than this hopeless tale of unrequited love as classics go id rather read to kill a mockingbird every day and twice on sundays okay im an english teacher and im supposed to love and adore this book but guess what i dont i find fitzgerald to be a bit nauseating i hate the protagonist nick who really isnt much of a strong protagonist so one could argue gatsby is the protagonist but hes pretty flat too but literally this is a book where nothing happens until the end bleck this is the book where maybe  of my students think its ok and about  who love it but the remaining claim its these classics that really make them hate reading i dont blame them in high school i would dislike it too im an adult and dislike it  after reading it many times sure i get the literary worth of the novel and how its a metaphor for society at the time and the downfall of wealth and the robber baron era wonderful and i sure can appreciate it but much like some people look at great works of art that cost thousands of dollars and go ugh thats ugly thats how i feel about gatsby i get it i appreciate it i wouldnt pay for it as people often remark after reading this book jay gatsby really did deserve better daisy did too something in the way fitzgerald let the materialistic and hollow views of the jazz age bleed into every aspect of the great gatsbys protagonists lives and those of the side characters too calls for a great load of sympathy  i was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life  when nick carraway moves to new york in the summer of  for business he is immediately intrigued by his mysterious rich neighbor mr gatsby gatsby lives in a huge mansion throws lavish parties every weekend and never lets anything slip about his past as we read on we learn more about how he became so wealthy and about his current infatuation with daisy buchanan nicks married cousin  something about the fact that the great gatsby is usually considered to be one of americas most loved novels undermined my experience reading it my expectations may have been too high there was just something missing for me some kind of spark or extremely impactful scene apparently even that ending wasnt enough i still enjoyed reading it very much  especially with the running theme of the jazz age and the decline of the american dream in the background  in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars ok well this is the first classic that i read in  yes its already february but im not the biggest reader of classics ive enjoyed my fair share of them to be sure but ive also disliked some classics so the writing was great i did like the prose in this novel but a lot of the time with classics i cant really seem to get emotionally invested and this book was no different its not that i wasnt interested in the text or its characters i were but for me at least there is a severe lack of any form of tension without this novels pages  i feel that as i primarily nowadays read books published in the last one or two decades with many being quite fast paced with lots of action im almost not used to reading something that is fairly slow and ponderous even though this wasnt even a long book its just not that exciting i guess to be fair as a teen going through classics it honestly may have to do with maturity before i can savour these better and i do prefer a bit more of a thrill that being said i dont mind slow books as long there is significant payoff at the end  and like why are so many classics just people going to each others houses and having tea or parties or the like i could swear nothing else happens but people talking to each other over food its not that i hate it and the characters are interesting and often the topic of discussion is engaging and the prose works so well but also why are there so many peoples houses to visit gah its s new york for goodness sake and they go to like one party at someones house but obviously  keeping this review short because im a lazy bastard but i mean this novel was fine i guessprobably not how most people would describe one of the worlds most beloved classics this book for me was good in parts but mostly it was rather mediocre for me this is a classic book that is ridiculously overrated i have read so many other classics that are beyond amazing but they never seem to receive the praise that they so rightly deserve i mean the great gatsby has been made into a film and there are some raving reviews on here about this book so i assumed that it was going to be wonderful unfortunately the book didnt deliver the plot was non engaging and fairly bland to a degree and i wasnt exactly on the edge of my seat  i did enjoy some of the subtle descriptive language used in this book and the way the characters masked the fact that everything wasnt okay was pretty impressive there are some particular quotes in this book that i admit are beautiful  it isnt all negativity for this book but i really do struggle to understand why it is so popular there are many others from the same kind of era that are much better sometimes i think people just pretend that classics are automatically great purely for the reason that they are classics i am very much in the minority here but this did absolutely nothing for me why is this considered canonical  edit after reading some reviews i realized that maybe the reason i did not feel the eureka moment from this book is because i do not believe in the american dream i see it as a capitalistic illusionso the death of the american dream did not hit me as hard as it could have what better time to read a classic than now i find i am slowly making it through my tbr list so at least this quarantine is good for something  i feel like the great gatsby is a hard novel to review simply because it is notorious for being so influential to literature that you must absolutely love it or risk looking ignorant and uncultured not to say this book wasnt enjoyable and it was an easy read seeing as it was so short however it is definitely a novel that is no longer ahead of its time  a novel with many overt and subtle meanings the great gatsby at the root of it all is a story of love given and taken by those who have committed their love to others  a story of arrogance and the desperation to be seen in a positive light and lifechanging lies and secrets gatsby is so intent on others viewing him as the aristocratic life of the party that he has spent his entire life living a lie built on others fortunes and efforts tom although having an affair himself is condescending toward his wife daisy accusing her of loving the effervescent gatsby and then when tragedy strikes everyone reverts back to what is comfortable and that is often the image they give to others vs what is the truth of their nature  now back to why this novel is so difficult to review it definitely was relevant in its time where racism and sexism were rampant and normal and the life of celebrity was admired and worshipped but these themes are timeless and hold a solid place in this society as well the characters however are not relatable vapid selfobsessed and vain every character in this novel with possibly the exception of nick was simply taking up space in the world and making sure others saw you doing it and not actually participating in it  the novel was wordy and although fitzgerald had quite the way with words he also appeared to have many tricks on saying the same thing in multiple ways half of the novel was spent setting and describing setting and scenery and although the plot was intriguing the novel was not long enough to have the majority of it filled with pretty words and prose  keeping that in mind it continues to be an infamous work of literature and i am glad i took a second glance at it reading it now as an adult i could see the deeper meanings throughout the novel that teenage me would have missed this novel has been made into a movie so many times that the characters now took the shape of tobey maguire and leonardo dicaprio in my head which took away from the enjoyment of the novel a little bit that movie version is still the greatest adaptation in my opinion   a quick read the great gatsby speaks to the dangers of putting all your efforts into appearances and the fragility of love definitely as relevant in parts  now as it was back then it is still a novel worth checking out  stars several of my friends convinced me to read their favourite book of all time i decided to see what all the fuss is about im soooooo glad i went with the audio version with the musical interludes like old radio plays tim robbins narration is amazing he kept me excited to hear more despite not being invested in the content i didnt really enjoy the book itself and probably would have given a much lower rating if i had not had tim robbins escorting me along
The Catcher in the Rye,i read the end of the catcher in the rye the other day and found myself wanting to take holden caulfield by the collar and shake him really really hard and shout at him to grow up i suppose ive understood for some time now that the catcher in the rye  a favorite of mine when i was sixteen  was a favorite precisely because i was sixteen at sixteen i found holden caulfields crisis profoundly moving i admired his searing indictment of society his acute understanding of human nature his extraordinary sensitivity i mean come on he had a nervous breakdown for gods sake he had to be sensitive at sixteen i wanted to marry holden caulfield at forty i want to spank him after all holdens indictment of society boils down to the insight that everybody is a phony thats the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep a forty year old of the grownup variety recognizes holdens insight as superficial and banal indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing it suggests a grasp of society and of human nature thats about as complex as an episode of dawsons creek holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered disillusionment and the end of innocence is unique in human history he cant see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment and neither can j d salinger for all his painful selfconsciousness holden caulfield is not really selfaware he cant see that he himself is a phony  compare salingers novel of arrested development for instance with a real bildungsroman great expectations holden caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence pip pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence holden caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context the larger view pip pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be he conveys at the same time the childs compelling perspective and the adults thoughtful revision of events while holden caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds pip pirrip skillfully concentrates on the spurious coin of his own make  that is without letting the child pip and the adolescent pip in on the joke he exposes himself as a phony pip pirrip grows up holden caulfield has a nervous breakdown  i suppose the only reason i begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture  many more unfortunately than just the legitimate adolescents among us  seem fixated on holden as a symbol of honesty and sociallyliberating rebellion we view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor a sign  to put it in caulfieldian terms  that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of joyces araby gazing up into the darkness i saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity and my eyes burned with anguish and anger here is the adolescent pose nonpareil equally selfaccusing and selfaggrandizing it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and selfdramatizing vision thats the kind of crap that holden caulfield and j d salinger cannot see through and it is often the kind of crap that we adults like to slosh around in  the barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood  as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility i remember a news story about a woman in a barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid and probably drunken antibarney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event now i dont know the age of the barneybeater but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us at the dawn of adolescence when barney begins to appear cloying and false it seems natural to want to beat up on him as though it was barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things i could see holden caulfield beating up on barney at least rhetorically and i could see holden caulfield missing barney as he misses all the phonies at the end of the book but i cannot see holden caulfield accepting the postlapsarian barney on new terms as a figure who is meant for children and not for him for all his touching poses about wanting to be the catcher in the rye what holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again i read this book for the first time in the th grade i had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing before i began reading i had so many expectations back then i read seventeen magazine and back then seventeen magazine ran brainy features about books and poetry there was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives and something like more than half said catcher in the rye i think there might have been some celebrity comments in there too at any rate it was a ringing endorsement  so you can imagine my disappointment when i hated it not only did i hate holden but i hated everything about the novel there was nothing i enjoyed i did my book report where i confessed my hatred which led my teacher to confess that she did too but i couldnt let it go i honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found lifechanging indicated some deep and horrible flaw i felt like hating catcher in the rye was my dirty little secret  time passed and my selfloathing mellowed i began to think that perhaps id come at it too young so after my first year of college i decided to reread it go at it with fresh eyes and see if my opinion had changed  heres the thing it hasnt i get it i get that holden is supposed to be loathsome i get that he is the hypocrite he hates i get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences i get it i do i just dont like it  oh and im not ashamed anymore edit stop liking and commenting on this review its  and the book is still shit  if i could give this book a zero i would i absolutely hated it generally i dont hate books either usually its a very strong dislike and generally i give them a second chance but no i will never be reading this book again  in my opinion holden is the worst character in the english language salinger tried just too damn hard to make him universal to the point where he becomes unrealistic his train of thought is annoying and repetitive and god those catchphrases of his can someone shut this kid up holden is almost the antigary stu nearly every things wrong with him the one good thing about him being his love for his younger sister  the plot is one of the worst ive ever read its boring and it like holden is unbelievably and painfully repetitive holden calls up an old friend has a drink holden calls up a girl has a drink holden dances with a girl then he drinks was there a climax to this book i must have missed it maybe it was holden nearly freezing to death um what in central park no no maybe it was when holden called up that hooker maybe not the plot is so fuzzy and flat i couldnt tell when to peak my interest  and thats just it it never did  so buhbye holden your books been gathering dust on my shelf for the past two years and itll stay that way until i decide to sell it of course my theory as to this books unusually polarizing nature either you identify with holden caulfield or you dont  those who see themselves either as they were or god help them as they are in holden see a misunderstood warriorpoet fighting the good fight against a hypocritical and unfeeling world they see in salinger a genius because he gets it and he gets them  those of us who dont relate to holden see in him a selfabsorbed whiner and in salinger a onetrickpony who lucked into performing his trick at a time when some large fraction of america happened to be in the right collective frame of mind to perceive this boring twaddle as subversive and meaningful in my hand i hold  i will give it to anyone who can explain the plot of this book or why there is no plot and make me understand why the hell people think its so amazing sometimes truth isnt just stranger than fiction its also more interesting and better plotted salinger helped to pioneer a genre where fiction was deliberately less remarkable than reality his protagonist says little does little and thinks little and yet salinger doesnt string holden up as a satire of deluded selfobsessives he is rather the epic archetype of the boring yet selfimportant depressive  ive taken the subway and had prolonged conversations on the street with prostitutes not concerning business matters and i can attest that salingers depiction is often accurate to what it feels like to go through an average unremarkable day however reading about an average day is no more interesting than living one  beyond that salinger doesnt have the imagination to paint people as strangely as they really are chekhovs normal little people seem more real and alive than salingers because chekhov injects a little oddness a little madness into each one real people are almost never quite as boring as modernist depictions because everyone has at least some ability to surprise you  salingers world is desaturated emotions and moments seep into one another indistinct as the memories of a drunken party little importance is granted to events or thoughts but simply pass by each duly tallied by an author in the role of court reporter  what is interesting about this book is not that it is realistically bland but that it is artificially bland yet as ridiculous a concept as that is it still takes itself entirely in earnest never acknowledging the humor of its own blase hyperbole  this allows the book to draw legions of fans from all of the ridiculously dull people who take themselves as seriously as holden takes himself they read it not as a parody of bland egotism but a celebration poised to inspire all the bland egotists who have resulted from the new egalitarianism in art poetry music and academia  those same folks who treat rationality and intellectual fervor like a fashion to be followed imagining that the only thing required to be brilliant is to mimic the appearance and mannerisms of the brilliant as if black berets were the cause of poetic inspiration and not merely a symptom  one benefit of this is that one can generally sniff out pompous faux intellectuals by the sign that they hold up holden as a sort of messianic figure anyone who marks out holden as a rolemodel is either a deluded teen with an inflated sense of entitlement or is trying to relive the days when they were  but what is more interesting is that those who idolize holden tend to be those who most misunderstand him upon close inspection hes not depressive not consumed with ennui or an existential crisis hes actually suffering from shell shocknow known as posttraumatic stress disorder  the way he thinks about his brothers and classmates deathsgoing over the details again and again in his mind but with no emotional connectionits not symptomatic of depression but of psychological trauma he is stuck in a cycle unable to process events going over them again and again but never able to return to normalcy  it takes a certain kind of selfcentered prick to look at someones inability to cope with the reality of death and think hey thats just like my mild depression over how my parents wont buy me a newer ipod its not an unusual stance in american literaturetheres an arrogant detachment in american thought which has become less and less pertinent as the world grows and changes as recently as the road we have american authors comparing a difficult fatherson relationship to the pain and turmoil of an african civil war survivorand winning awards for displaying their insensitive arrogance  perhaps its time we woke up and realized that the wellfed despondence of the white man should not be equated with a lifetime of death starvation war and traumas both physical and emotional and as for salingera real sufferer of posttraumatic stress who was one of the first soldiers to see a concentration camp who described how you can never forget the smell of burning fleshi can only imagine how he felt when people read his story of a man crippled by the thought of death and thought to themselves yes thats just what its like to be a trustafarian with uncool parents no wonder he became a recluse and stopped publishing well this was a pain to get through  first of all this is a shitty way to start a novel no matter how you want to introduce your main character  if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth  description that is easily one of the saddest most pathetic introductions to a book as i started this book i wondered if the introduction is like this how will the rest of the book be  this is what the rest of the book looked like  he was also the nicest in lots of ways he never got mad at anybody people with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily but allie never did and he had very red hair ill tell you what kind of red hair he had  i sort of used to go to allies baseball matches  it was around tenthirty i guess when i finished it  i can imagine holden as this very insipid boring little kid with no life in him whatsoever  also holden thinks everyone besides him is a phony and a moron and he makes it very clear because he mentions it like every two pages literally every damn time  i read some of the comments regarding how i didnt understand this book because i didnt relate to it that may be true very very true regardless i still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and a dry boring writing style perhaps i will read it again when i am older and maybe ill enjoy it a spell in the army would do that young man a power of good or maybe a couple of bags of heroin anything to stop that whining voice reading this book was one of the biggest wastes of my time in the past twenty years holden caulfields problem is that he is the biggest phony he knows count the number of times he lies or behaves like someone hes not and then try to convince me otherwise this is not a book about teenage alienation its about a smartass who cant deal with who he really is and spends almost  pages ranting about it  most likely to a doctor in a psych ward i know there are people who thought this book changed their lives and helped them find their unique way in the world but coming from a nonwhite nonmiddleclass background as a kid i really resented having to read about this spoiled screwed up white rich kid who kept getting chance after chance and just kept blowing it because he was so selfabsorbed and selfpitying i felt at the time there was no redeeming value in it for me i was born on the outside trying my best to get in i felt no sympathy for him at all i didnt even find him funny it just made me angry i guess it still does please take this review as an account from a fourteen year old maybe consider that before you make some extremely inappropriate judgments about me  tw sexism homophobia gaslighting inaccurateinappropriate interpretations of depression violence and abuse  i dont think ive ever despised a book more than this one i cannot positively find a good thing to say about it whatsoever before anyone decides to come at me for hating this book and say andrea youre so immature and uneducated or andrea it was written in the s what do you expect no i will not apologize for detesting this book and no i will not excuse any of its problematic content because it came out a long time ago to top it all off i practically killed myself reading it it was awful to get through i wish i could throw the book into a paper shredder but it belongs to my dad and its from the early s so if i wait a couple of years i can probably get an antique shop store credit  this book is aboutwell i couldnt even tell you a character examination an inadequate and inaccurate account of depression a plot to piss everyone off who is reading a slacker who does stupid things and uses hypocrisy and lying to get himself out of situations that he created a boy who gets kicked out of school  one of the worst things if not the worst thing about this book is the vernacular used jd salinger writes in this method in which he attempts to emulate the way an actual teenager speaks that would make it more realistic he thought but it was actually just annoying if i have to hear another character holden caulfield use the phrase like a madman or like a bastard or goddam which was horribly misspelled by the way i am literally going to gouge my eyes out with a spoon to make it even worse it was also obnoxiously repetitive i counted the word goddam seven times on one page he also had an affinity for the sentence it killed me every time that was used i literally wanted to be killed  the other most pressing attribute of this book is holden caulfield himself probably my least favorite character of all time i got dragged for disliking this book so i think i deserve to drag this character for some time now if theres one thing i cant stand its hypocrisy lying and shamingjudging other people for what they like to do or tendencies they may have i have been shamed and judged many a time due to my interests and anxieties the fact that holden caulfield is constantly judging constantly shaming and constantly criticizing other people for what they do when he should just stand in a mirror and do a selfexamination infuriates me there is not a second that passes by in that book without holden getting angry or depressed because someone lived their life and upset his little hipster fantasy  holden seems to be agitated by everything yet he continues to comply with the things that agitate him ill reference a specific example grand theres a word i really hate its a phony i could puke every time i hear it page  in two pages he uses that exact word in a sentence without thinking anything of it he constantly and unreasonably points out others for being phony when hes the one whos really phony the filthy hypocrite he almost hates certain people for being reasonable and not complying with his own corrupt morals and standards i understand that the author is trying to show that he is a flawed character but he just unsettles me  another thingi get that this book is utterly sexist and homophobic because its outdated but that doesnt mean i have to appreciate it or dismiss it the way he treats the women in his life and belittles the homosexual community is just awful there is a whole paragraph where he discusses his distaste for men who dont treat women right and who are boring implying that women should go for nice guys like him then on the next page he describes his date with a girl saying that they horsed around even though she didnt really want to but inherently had no other choice this honestly feeds into the hypocrisy along with the sexism he can be quoted calling girls weak stupid and dumb not specifically but in general he can be found making fun of flits in which he describes homosexuals as phonies in regard to gender this regard is disgusting i dont understand how people who read this book in this present time can manage to ignore that and call this an excellent book  this book did not have a predictable ending at all it had a horrible ending if you dont want to be spoiled for the ending skip to the next paragraph but if you dont care by all means be my guest and continue reading this book ends with holden coming back home it begins with him getting kicked out of prep school and running away and it ends with him coming home to his family and finding another school no sign of resolution no sign of conclusion just the story being like okay fun nothings changing its going to end abruptly byebye now there was no sense of ending i understand that sometimes books do not necessarily have a happy ending but with a book like this that has already charted its course with little to no plot i think some resolution is required i felt like my time had been wasted after finishing  lastly id like to talk about this books interpretation of depression now dont get me wrong someone who is depressed can be a slacker and not want to care about school at all and flunk out of everything and not have any friends but this books interpretation was insanely problematic the way the character was portrayed made the book seem as if holden was diseased because of his depression and that he was so awful because of it maybe this is just my opinion but thats not a good message to share to your audience  overall this book was horrendous ghastly abominable it had no point and it consisted of holden running away doing stupid crap lying about it getting away with it and then just having it never appear again or show any effect to the story the writing didnt make it interesting and neither did the characters all of which i hated i dont recommend this book and ive done so many analysis assignments and projects that i never never never want to see it again  edit can we in the comments please stop giving me hate for writing this review i dont know if anyone realized this but i was a minor at the time of writing this and am still a minor and i really dont appreciate the endless threats i got for sharing my opinion i understand that the version of me who read this book in her freshman year of high school took this book in a different account than how it was meant to be taken but never did i say that anyone who likes this book is horrible i understand that you may not agree with me and i respect that but to completely chew out a minor who had a premature opinion in paragraphs and paragraphs of writing is maybe something that should be more thought out maybe you can make a statement commenting on how you think im wrong and then you can commit to somethingmore fulfilling if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is what i thought about the catcher in the rye and my reasons for liking it or disliking it and possibly even how i felt about the work each of the four times ive wasted my time reading it and all that mein kampf kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth also id probably have to take the time to learn how to italicize things on goodreads which would probably be worthwhile but my computer skills could easily be outshone by a resuscitated troglodyte fresh from an iceblock added to that i dont know how long i could go on trying to poorly mimic the book without wanting to puke i mean not only is it a crumby thing to do to but its also phony as hell  so what do i think about the madman exploits of old holden caufield perhaps one of the most acclaimed protagonists in all of american literature no terribly much as a matter of fact each time ive read this book i wanted to kill myself holdens always saying things like that i mean if you were to wear one blue sock and one red sock and maybe slowly skin your shrivelfig under the comforting cotton of a green sock hed say something like god how i hate how that guy messes around with his socks it makes me want to kill myself in that case youd better hope youre at least in possession of a decent valise lest that bastard caulfield spread some more wrath upon you for your clearly inferior luggage that guy he really cracks me up  i never really understood why this book is so universally adored sure holden is a slacker the type of clown that every distraught kid envisions themselves to be some gem in the rough with all the talent but lacking the ambition to make a notable mark on the world which holds them back but you grow up if only to acknowledge you have no talents and still have no ambition and instead of grabbing for that golden ring you waste your time writing shitty reviews on shitty books here on goodreads on a balldampeningly warm sunday afternoon come to think of it thats probably why so many appreciate this bumbling tale like holden they probably equate themselves to that misshapen hunk of precious metal hidden beneath a untilled mound of nebraskan soil laying in wait for someone to unearth their sparkling brilliance for all the world to admire of course when you realize tucker max probably felt the same way you immediately bathe in bromine and shave what remains of your flesh completely bald to scour the scourge as thoroughly as humanly possible perhaps it may be slightly more promising to delude yourself than resigning your life to the contemplation of just how lame you actually are  so heres a quick glimpse of whats inspired so many lifelong laughingstocks heres holden fruitlessly swimming against the current a complete nincompoop lets remember hes irish who gets kicked out of school for being a moron and talks hard yet winds up getting the shit mercilessly beaten out of him by a crumby snob named stradlater a book about studly strad would have been far better and a pimp named maurice holden also feels the need to denounce everyone as a phony though i find myself at a loss to imagine anything phonier than a wimpy bigmouthed mick mollycoddled by daddys fat bankroll while attending prep school along with his stunning array of handcrafted italian leather luggage lets not gloss over the fact that holden is probably impotent as evidenced by his inability to lay the wood to sally jane or even a prostitute perhaps his crowning disgrace either that or hes queer seeing as he duped poor antolini by presenting his former mentor with the ultimate fantasy of a drunken sexuallyinexperienced youth with no place to go and then afraid that further action might expose his impotence he felt the need to flee into the night acting all startled about what just transpired lets face it holden himself claims that similar perverty stuff happened to him a lot as a kid and then feigns shock when antolini comes in to take a juicy bite of the bare bottom he so masterfully baited all this weirdness coming from an awkward geek with a fondness for children ought to be enough to sway any who remain unconvinced thus far youre still not seeing the light seriously ok last clue caulfield is a deviant the kid aspires to be a catcher and this catcher fantasy involves children if you need further explanation ill be required to rent a jackhammer to pound the obvious into your skull  this will hopefully be the last time that i read the catcher in the rye as ive given it too many chances and always walked away completely disappointed i will give salingers opus two stars however simply for the entertainment of laughing at it well whatever this was underwhelming as hell i dont exactly know what i mean by that but i mean it  being and especially having a teenage narrator sucks what the hells the matter with you the narration by holden caulfied in the the catcher in the rye made me think a bit of the russian english dialect in a clockwork orange except that i in that book in the end found the way of speaking to be a good way to set an atmosphere and a proper functional device and here i found it terribly annoying and leading nowhere like the whole novel in a sense  i expected a lot upfront of jd salinger his most famous work i mean normal people is called a millennial version of this and i loved that novel holden caulfield is a real teenager his speech is full of hyperboles i told him fiftya thousand times and whatevers and alls as hells it really is i swear and goddamns while he is being kicked from school he admits already in chapter two that he sometimes speaks as a twelve year old and in chapter three he terms himself an excellent liar putting his tale of his expulsion in an unreliable narrator light that however does not have any pay off in a sense you can say that on almost everything holden tries or wants at some point during the story no follow up is given most of the time because he doesnt feel like it he was in my view infuriating and rather a hypocrite like why does he hang out with people he first says he doesnt like and then calls them phony sure thats something teenager do but people also pick there nose and dont write a story about that kind of bad habbits  for someone for whom english is the only subject he does not fluke holden his vocabulary is very limited constantly repeating itself sometimes his narration feels almost trump like some exhibits he hated it when you called him a moron all morons hate it when you call them a moron  when she cant think of anything to say she doesnt say a goddamn word  i mean he was very intelligent and all but you could tell he didnt have too much brains  wuddaya mean philosophy ya mean sex and all that what you mean  he even admits the following when someone confronts him on this matter your mind is immature it is it really is i know it there is even something that a character calls a typical caulfield conversation later in the book all sex and hormones while he is being a virgin as well  to top this off everything is crumby or he is or wants to horse around and we have some gross nail clipping broken nails and pimple popping  allright there are some themes that are kind of interesting i never seem to have anything that if i lost it id care too much the only real heart in the first chapters is the death of his older brother to leukemia and the selfmutilation following from that and an offhand comment about a gift of his mum almost every time somebody gives me a present it ends up making me sad shows some real emotion as does his touching depiction of his kid sister  at times this made the book feel like a less impactful and tight version of the bell jar psychological trauma and a sense of purposelessness while being in one of the most exciting place on earth broadway here and new york in general in sylvia plath her novel comes back prominently the lack of an overarching tale in a postwar and postreligious world and angst about that is also visible  to spice it up we have some suicides by bullying on his class obsessed school and holden seems to spend money as a kind of therapy as a kind of early latecapitalism critique and it is interesting how he treats new york as a kind of village even asking someone in central park if shed seen his sister and getting a response that the person knew her even  finally everyone can relate to the escapist fantasies of starting a simple live and travel the world he has and there is some wit between all the repetitive thoughts holden has that guy morrow was about as sensitive as a goddamn toilet seat  mothers are all slightly insane  still this is not nearly enough in my opinion to warrant the excruciating reading experience of following holden during a frankly completely wasted week people are always ruining things for you the above quote is not just immature teenager hate against the world but also an accurate depiction how i feel about holden throwing in his own windows during this book in a consistent manner there is basically no plot it is all character and he as main character is a conceited jaded nothing brings him joy type of person everything he perceives has a mocking voiceover in his head and he tired me out despite this being only a short work  he is super fickle one moment he loves something two sentences later it kills him one moment he has an urge to marry a girl two pages further he hates her guts also the amount of times he goes to somewhere or wants something and then he arrives there and hes just not in the mood and nothing ends up happening just kills me multiple times this is the case really it is a wonder he goes ice skating somewhere halfway the book and actually does that he constantly repeats and speaks against himself making the whole book feel both frantic and inert maybe a bit manic depressed even  in the end the depiction of holden his struggle with life just feels overdone and hardly warranted given all the privileges he has as a white upper class male with a rich father in the s combined with a lack of a redemptive finale or any development in his character i cant rate this higher than  star dear holden  a lot 
The Lord of the Rings,look at thisss hobbitses not bought at flea market for ten francses catalogue says worth seven hundred dollarses oh yes not knows about bookses gollum but cant touch cant read she says too valuable going to eat fish instead but nice birthday present oh yes precious this is the story of frodo who goes on an impossible quest to destroy a very powerful and magical ring along the way frodo travels with various characters and they find themselves constantly in peril  this book was very challenging for a variety of reasons it has a completely different world with completely new beings hobbits etc while the book flows as if you know all about these creatures additionally it was so different from reality that it was difficult to visualize this was one of the rare instances where i feel that the movie was better than the book the quest is extremely long and it kept reiterating the fact that they are taking on a quest that might not be successful although it served as a good reminder to really challenge oneself it was very repetitive and my patience was wearing thin in a  page book it also was extremely slow going in places more than  pages just to leave to go on the adventure personally i felt that it was such a chore to read this book and it derailed my entire reading plan for  the hobbit was much shorter and straight to the point  that being said tolkien created entire worlds that creativity has laid the foundation for so many other authors and stories this book has inspired people to dream dreams it just didnt inspire me however i feel that i would be remiss if i didnt note that the impact this book has had in the world and on artsliterature even in the present year i could reread a page or two but i would not want to read this book again  the endingafter  pages it seemed very abrupt and i was left thinking um why didnt they just do that in the beginning to destroy the ring the true source of the fantasy fiction genre tolkien has spawned so many fantasy writers since the lord of the rings went into print i love all the earlier ones too like verne and carrol and cs lewis but the hobbit and the lord of the rings its like an institution  who else besides me has the notion that the real hero in the lord of the rings story is sam sam is the typical accidental hero he is the girl or boy next door the ordinary folk sam is you and me and represents the courage we all have inside of us he shows that when the going gets tough and the shit hits the fan it is the most unlikely of us that step up heros are not always musclebound hunks not always the james bond type character or the brilliant lawyer bringing justice to the deserving almost all of the time the hero is the one that does the things that go unnoticed uncelebrated there is a hero in all of us whether we know it or not    a hobbit finds himself on a quest that will change his life  an adventure full of peril and strife  an ancient evil is rising to come forth again  like a dark cancer enveloping causing suffering and pain  a gold ring will help frodo on his way make him invisible to all near by  but give away his location as sauron sees him from most high  like the all seeing eye of lucifer the eye from the skies  and frodo is in extreme danger as a dark army begins to rise  strider and legolas and gimley will aid him and samwise gamgee  and meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took and gandalf to complete the band of brothers a family  gollum the sinister one the gold ring an obsession  gollum wants it back from fodos possession  a tale of great adventure fantasy of the highest esteem  tolkien was a master to me thats all he has ever been  the fellowship of the ring begins with the shire and winds its way through the barren lands that lie on the way to mordor i tried to read this part of the book once but dnf it then then i picked up the trilogy bound in one volume and went through it fairly steadily  ive read that tolkien wasnt as original as first claimed there is a book called the broken sword that has parallels with lotr nevertheless tolkien take on traditional myths was unique and groundbreaking the eddas the welsh myths and norse myths all are the foundation for this great story  this was a reread and was a satisfactory one because i wanted to reach my favorite parts i looked forward to read tom bombadils part again did it then the rivendell parts ditto slowly i wound my way sometimes following sam and frodo sometimes aragorn gandalf appears relatively scantily towards the third book i had a lot of fun reading lotr and ive not yet deleted it from my ereader because im tempted to reread it soon five well deserved stars indeed i have read lotr many times over the years in fact it is i think the book i have read the most in this world which i suppose makes it my favourite book albeit closely followed by half a dozen others shout if you want to know or take a gander at my favourites shelf i have always enjoyed it understatement but for some reason this reread is more special than ever i had almost forgotten how much was different from the films and despite having read lotr once before since the films i seem to be getting more from the book this time than ever before  the fellowship of the ring  stars   as part of a buddy read i have just completed the first book of the trilogy and have given it   as anyone who actually reads my reviews will know i very rarely need to use spoilers as i leave other people to read the book themselves so you will find no or few spoilers in this review the first book weaves an amazing tale with incredible characters in a well constructed world the characters and situations make you smile laugh and even cry as the journey begins the fellowship is put together and at the close of this book so cruelly broken having somehow forgotten the differences to the film i thoroughly enjoyed the differences especially tom bombardil and the river daughter and surprisingly i enjoyed all the poems some brought tears to my eyes is it the first time i have really read them  the pilgrimage of frodo sam and their fellows lasted for a year and it happened so that it took me nearly as long to see them home to the shire well people say good things happen slowly so i dont regret the journey one bit  something crosses my mind that terry pratchett has shared in a slip of the keyboard he was  or  when he read the lord of the rings for the first time his parents left him at some neighbors house to babysit their children while all the adults went visit somebody to pass the time terry who as all boys wasnt very keen on reading got absorbed in the lotr and suddenly the shire had spread out in his imagination and the edges of the shabby carpet turned in the shires borders and beyond them adventures were awaiting so terry pratchett read all night long and for the whole next day too he read the novel for  hours with some small breaks of course  the bladder of a yearold is not a waterskin after all in the years to come he continued to reread the book each year this is how it goes brilliant minds resonate in accord  when i was almost finished with the novel i realized that the lord of the rings is actually an allegory of the human life there is a spirit of idyll in the shire days are lazy and sometimes tinted with mischievousness and gandalfs visits are sheer feasts  that looks very much like childhood perhaps then you step outside the hobbit hole and the limits of the known and you plunge into adventures  you had been yearning so much to lose those familiar faces for a while and see if some glorious song might be sung for you too the journey starts jolly one repast follows another the food in the first part is indeed quite abundant  tolkien himself says that if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world you sing songs admire everything new and your eyes are as big as pancakes as you try to perceive all novelties that happen to you  i suppose thats the period of youth after that though you slowly realize that you carry a truly heavy burden on your shoulders that you have responsibilities and failure means too much it means the world songs are noticeably fewer you sing once in a blue moon and its only to give yourself courage and to remember the past when things used to be simple and not to enjoy yourself and like in life there are glimpses of hope but also precipitous collapses in pitchdark depths you are sometimes alone among the multitude and sometimes there is a friend to lend you a helping hand and you put one foot in front of the other and keep going because you know that nobody is going to wage that battle for you and you rely on the flickering hope that one day you could sigh im finally back  there is some very sweet melancholy seeped through tolkiens world or at least i felt it that way the verdure and meadows in the shire to fight for the world but also for your tiny homeland though it will never be the same to do all you are capable of for what you know is good and right even if you wont be there to enjoy it yourself it must often be so sam when things are in danger someone has to give them up lose them so that others may keep them  choose a dauntless pony let his name be bill for example or a proud steed as shadowfax and ride through the middleearth there be wonders for some reason i only marked the fellowship of the ring as read when i actually devoured the whole of the lord of the rings in one go  i read this a loong time ago when the films came out but i remember loving it a lot amazing book amazing films a wonderful distraction from my finals at uni back in the day for some reason i only marked the fellowship of the ring as read when i actually devoured the whole of the lord of the rings in one go  i read this a loong time ago when the films came out but i remember loving it a lot amazing book amazing films a wonderful distraction from my finals at uni back in the day save time watch the movies this book can appeal only to a linguist the underlying story is great but it is buried under an avalance of horribly annoying songs and poems that do nothing to advance the story they just take up space i diligently read every last one hoping that they held some deep meaning in relation to the story but if there is one it is so obscure that it serves no purpose also the book is all about walking yes i know they are on an epic quest and there has to be soulsearching etc but the amount of detail regarding the walking is a snoozer  pages of walking and  pages for a huge battle augh i know that this is a masterpiece and i agree that the plot line is a beautiful tale of good and evil and power and corruption however reading this series was a drudgery the only really good part that you miss in the movies is when the hobits return to the shire in the last three chapters of the return of the king if you want a tolkien fix id reccommend the hobbit best read ever it remains the best of its genre no matter how many fantasy worlds have emerged since  funnily many of my students come and talk to me about the specific edition they have at home and how it was handed to them by a father or mother who insisted they read through the first  pages before giving up  we have copies in german swedish and english at home published between the s and now but i know there is an older version somewhere in the wider family collection the one my father read when he was young finding evidence of former lord of the rings reading stories is magical in itself a ritualistic passing on of the passion for that one ring and its fate from generation to generation  posttolkien readers share that special fellowship that comes from holding your breath with frodo and sam from suffering with gandalf and cursing saruman from swinging a weapon with the united forces of an entire fairytale up against mordor  of course we also share the gain and loss of arwens choice  forever magic i read lord of the rings first when i was about eleven or so and then stayed up all night at a hip boygirl party in the bathroom with nathan o  talking about ents and elves and whether tom bombadil was god yes i was a geeky child however all these years later the story has stuck with me  first a warning dont read tolkien if you dont appreciate trueomnicientnarratorstyle epics tolkien isnt a master character builder he leaves all that to the readers imagination the agony in the aragornarwen romance  so blatant and operatic in the movies  was a longing look on striders face at rivendell an odd comment from bilbo and a short nononsense appendix as with many of the themes in this work the romance and deep character relationships must be picked from between the lines  and there is so much between the lines here the world of middleearth lives utterly lives instead of tugging on whatifs this fantasy forces readers to imagine tolkiens work is the fullest realization of literary world building ever penned  it is also sophisticated writing drawing on older forms epic romance tragedy tolkien doesnt waste time writing snappy dialogue the story is too epic to dwindle to individual persons however voice shifts subtly depending on point of view chapters dealing with hobbits contain much more dialogue and detail chapters dealing with rohirrim have a poetic rhythm reminiscent of extant middle english works chapters dealing with elves are magic and blurry and hard to wrap a mind around these shifts in style far from being a novice writers oops are intentional and serve as mass characterisation of races and groups so what tolkien foregoes in terms of dialogue he replaces with style and action a classic example of show not tell  having just spouted all that praise i have to admit that all the criticisms are true the story does resound with luddite antiindustrial metaphors overt christian themes of salvation and spirit a structural decision to include songs that doesnt quite work and fantasy tropes that are now cliche  now that everyone else has copied them that is the thing to remember is that this book started the genre everything fantasy from philip pullman to george rr martin exists in the shadow of this opus  so no it isnt a popcorn read get over it if you invest the time and spirit to read this work you will be glad you did i know i read this series at the tender age of eight when i was very impressionable and very eager to get obsessed with anything but i think these are better than we give them credit for  not to show up and act like jrr tolkein was some misunderstood genius but its fascinating to me that this book was foundational to modern high fantasy a genre which i think plays a lot with cruelty the brutal world the betrayal of friends tolkeins novels do not revolve around complex moral codes they do not question whether there is good and evil or who is who the fundamental hero of this story is love  its no accident that the hero of this series is the most underestimated of all people a hobbit there are the godly elves but this series focuses on mens capacity to fail and triumph the outsiders save the world  i think all the time about the fact that were it not for one moment of pity frodo takes on someone who he knows will try to hurt him this entire story would have been differentwould have ended on a far far darker note  on weekends i also take time to think very deeply about sams role in the series and the fact that his love and loyalty saves frodo and by extent the world within this narrative love saves the world  the biggest flaw is that tolkein could not edit to save his life i will not elaborate on that beyond to say he would dedicate at least five pages to explaining the concept im going to keep it very very real my love for this comes partially from just how much i adore the movie adaptations this is genuinely the  series in the world where i think the movie adaptation is superior in quality to the books ive watched them so many times i think every time i watch them i end up adding a few sentences to this review because im full of thoughts and tenderness the movies are my favorite and always worth a watch when a book defines a genre there is nothing you can say anymore that will add or detract from the volumes and volumes of all that has been said before so a book review im not attempting though the gr site is sorely tempting just paying my respects from the bottom of my heart and raising my hat to the master of the art every reading journey has a beginning even if that beginning comes across as lame as hell in the retelling my beginning with this particular book occurred on a wedding anniversary date i was a few cran and vodkas over the limit and had decided that a nice leisurely stroll through the bookstore would help clear my head before venturing on to our next destination the grocery store yes you read that right my anniversary date celebration consisted of booze books and groceries im pretty sure if you google anniversary gifts by year for the modern working couple with children you will see this exact scenario listed under year sixteen if it isnt there i vote it should be because silver hollowware who actually wants that  anyway  when i happened upon this ginormous book in all of its leather bound glory i knew that i had to possess it i realized that buying it would force me to read it sooner than later and it was a book that had lived on my mental toread list for a very long time what i didnt consider was the size of the book and how difficult it would be for me to lug it around everywhere i went sober me would have thought of this and went for the story broken out across three books instead of one tipsy me saw the fancy binding smelled the pages and could care less about my future suffering i saw my precious and nothing was going to stop me from making it my own especially not commonsense  my reading stretched on for weeks on end and every day the book got heavier and more cumbersome if you arent singing m right now then you cant call yourself my friend a few chapters in and i decided to get a tote to make my traveling easier and to protect my precious from rain stains and torn pages i was frodo and the tote became my sam without my durable new friend i would have been miserable and it would have taken me a hell of a lot longer to finish one of the best stories i have read in a while i also wouldnt have been able to enjoy the characters i had fallen hard for in all of the various locations i was able to visit because of it exciting locations such as the doctors waiting room and a hotel room in texas to name a few  five stars to a book that taught me to appreciate epic journeys and all of the friends you might find along the way and zero stars to a specific edition of that same book that taught me not to visit the bookstore under the influence of alcohol just kidding the book is gorgeous and it makes a great new addition to my real bookshelf theres not really much to say other than epic i thoroughly enjoyed reading this for the first time ive seen the peter jackson trilogy and really enjoyed those as well but this time it was fun to read the original story jrr tolkien created so much in the middleearth realm and the lotr books only capture a small portion i feel he truly created a genre and set the standard for epic fantasy  the movies obviously left material out for time and added some for creativity along the way in my opinion both are strong this edition had appendices innthe back to help with time lines back story and touched on a lot of the mythos based in tolkiens world he created so much that the hobbit and the silmarillion are recommended reads to further explore this genre thanks note sept   i just edited this review again to delete the word trilogy since a reader made a comment objecting to it strictly speaking tolkien did envision the lotr books as a single long novel which in terms of plot structure it actually is not a trilogy in the usual sense its just published in three volumes because its sheer length makes it unwieldy in one  note march   i just edited this review to insert an accidentally omitted word  actually i read tolkiens masterful middle earth fantasy corpus beginning with the hobbit in the early s and finishing the lord of the rings almost a decade later before this anniversary edition came out i also read all four books to my wife in the early s she loved them too  this body of work is of course the genredefining classic of modern fantasy especially epic or high fantasy  which popularized the genre as the publishing market force it is today exerted enormous influence over practically all subsequent fantasy authors including r a salvatore and terry brooks and set the conventions readers would come to expect a pretechnological setting an epochal struggle between good and evil whose outcome is determined by magical factors and a demand for personal moral growth on the part of the characters thrust into a pivotal role in that struggle and tolkiens depictions of wizards elves dwarfs dragons etc became the template for all subsequent portrayals of these creatures  part of the success of tolkiens work derives from the breath taking scope of his worldbuilding which reflects his day jobs as a philologist and medievalist he created entire languages and folklores for his middle earth as well as a detailed milleniaspanning history but more importantly as a devout catholic he embodied his deeply christian worldview in the writing his fantasy world though he doesnt employ the kind of explicit christian symbolism that c s lewis does is the scene of conflict between good and evil with worldaltering significance under a superintending providence in which the individual moral choices of both the high and the lowly have significance and temptation is an everpresent danger i have read jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings probably and this truly is but a very conservative estimate at least fifteen or more times since my mid twenties i did first attempt it at the age of twelve but my english language skills were at that time not sufficiently fluent to appreciate the lord of the rings for the masterpiece it is so i am glad i gave up to try again later and indeed i have also never once perused the lord of the rings as an actual trilogy as i have always considered it as one entity and a single reading period of time mostly because i have never even remotely believed that the fellowship of the rings the two towers and the return of the king should in any manner be considered as stand alone novels in and of themselves and therefore that they really do require a perusal as one all encompassing work of epical fiction and by the way not as an allegory as i have also and indeed never believed those critics who claim that the lord of the rings is supposed to represent an allegory against war or against national socialism  and indeed and in my humble opinion one does absolutely and yes without question need to read and approach the lord of the rings as an epic and to equally realise and understand that because it has been written by jrr tolkien like and as the latter like and as an epic it is for the most part very if not even almost one hundred percent plot driven with an abundance of specific physical and yes sometimes very much minute details about middle earth about both the positives and negatives of middle earth about the threats that are both obviously and insidiously stalking middle earth and the many reasons for this and therefore and definitely with much less of a deliberate emphasis on getting into the internal workings of the multitude of characters presented and depicteddescribed by tolkien by the author within the pages of his the lord of the rings and no i am not in any manner saying or claiming that the characters of the lord of the rings are somehow unimportant or lesser but simply and yes indeed that like with the epical narrarives and stories of antiquity and the middle ages the tale of the threat of the ring of power of saurons reawakening and restrengthening and of frodo samwise gandalf aragon legolas and the rest of the fellowship setting out on their quest to take the one ring back to mordor to be destroyed in the volcanic fires of mount doom is much is considerably more essential and necessary knowledge and information than detailed analyses of character and having the latter with nuance and psychology developed at the potential detriment to plot and storylines  but furthermore i also do very much and personally understand and appreciate that for some readers the vast amount of writing and especially the myriad of inserted song like poems can have the tendency to make the lord of the rings potentially or even actually much daunting and offputting however i also do have to say and claim that i have actually only one time and this the very first time i tackled lotr in its entirety at the age of about twentyfive read all of the poems as well as the myriad of foot and endnotes that are part of the lord of the rings and that whenever i do reread lotr while i always read slowly deliberately and with appreciation of and for tolkiens eye for detail and description i also tend to skim and skip a goodly number of the inserted songs but always do read and even sing my personal favourites such as the song of the merry old inn and the beautiful but heartbreaking lament for boromir and yes those parts of in particular the two towers section that i for one always find tedious and dragging mostly when frodo and samwise are trudging through the marshes with gollum simply because i just happen to find the story threads that feature aragon legolas and gimli considerably more interesting engaging and even sometimes a bit humorous and while some lotr completists and fundamentalists might well find my way of reading anathema and problematic and perhaps even an insult to jrr tolkiens work and legacy for me coming to the lord of the rings selectively and occasionally if not even often skimming and skipping those parts that i am finding and have always found a bit tedious and dragging this has also made me enjoy and appreciate tolkiens oeuvre all the more and all the more lastingly with me not only ranking the lord of the rings with five stars but also always being both willing to reread and indeed very much looking forward to rereading the lord of the rings ever two to three years this is the entire epic lord of the rings trilogy tolkien created an imaginative and incredibly detailed world with an unforgettable struggle between good and evil played out on so many different levels and in different ways with various characters its not necessarily an easy read  tolkien can get a little dry at times  but theres so much richness and depth to it  sigh i really need to reread this sometime soon  the bbc big read says its the  novel ever beating out the likes of pride  prejudice jane eyre and harry potter who am i to argue it certainly was my first and favorite in the realm of fantasy literature as an adult ive come to appreciate the traditional novels more from writers like the brontes jane austen charles dickens and others but the mysterious and magical land and inhabitants of middle earth will always have a welcome spot in my heart and mind i became horrifically lazy towards the end of the lotr reread which was undertaken as part of my month of the kitten squisher and neglected to review the final two books which together make up the return of the king not so much resting on my laurels as stretching out full length and having a big old snooze right on top of them but youve all seen the film by now right i was forced to read this book each member of my first book club had an opportunity to choose the book we read when one of the members chose the lord of the rings i was not happy fantasy is not my genre but i was a good book club member and read it anyway  i loved it there were times when i did not want to sleep because i wanted to finish just one more page or chapter tolkien creates whole worlds languages species and histories it is epic in its scope somehow he manages to entertain make you think and visualize the world he describes  it taught me a lesson about being open to new things because sometimes by being open you can be richly rewarded this was what i wanted it to be the first time i read it it is a good thing not all tears are an evil cause the words of the last few pages got pretty blurry my full review has been moved over to my website and in its place i have left a defence of the novel itself if you would like to read my review please click the following link my review of jrr tolkiens the lord of the rings  the lord of the rings was the book that created my love of literature when i first read it at the age of twelve certainly i was a precocious reader beforehand and the chronicles of narnia and the hobbit have much to be thanked for also however it was the lord of the rings that pushed me onto a path of epic fantasy and grand classics without it i would no doubt have avoided ulysses and crime and punishment  works of equal importance for in my eyes the lord of the rings is a great and versatile work it has a riveting story  a story so compelling and so punctuated with themes that it demands a rereading from me time and time again it has poetry and imagined history of the type that many aspire to recreate and yet no one can for there is only one lord of the rings and it does not share power with other aspiring fantasy works  to finish therefore i will briefly attempt to answer the critics of this monumental work not in a manner that is in any way conclusive or exhaustive but in a manner that satisfies my cravings for i find there is much in the lord of the rings that is often overlooked nowadays  due in part to changing attitudes to fantasy fiction politics history and the many tolkien clones and fantasy movies available   the biggest criticisms of tolkien can all be found in the one source in michael moorcocks essay epic pooh his essay begins with a fascinating quote by clyde s kilby which begins why is the rings being widely read today at a time when perhaps the world was never more in need of authentic experience this story seems to provide a pattern of itthe final statement of this quoted paragraph is exceptionally revealing however for a century at least the world has been increasingly demythologized but such a condition is apparently alien to the real nature of men now comes a writer such as john ronald reuel tolkien and as remythologizer strangely warms our souls  this quote also brings us to the first criticism made by moorcock keeping in mind that moorcock to me exemplifies the overall criticisms made by many about fantasy and the lord of the rings as part of that he writes that the sort of prose most often identified with high fantasy is the prose of the nurseryroom it is a lullaby it is meant to soothe and console it is mouthmusic it is frequently enjoyed not for its tensions but for its lack of tensions it coddles it makes friends with you it tells you comforting lies  to moorcock tolkiens work is both overly romanticised and escapist all at once he links success with the fact that the novels appeal to what people want to read not with what they should read yet to state such is to me a form of cold cynicism i do not believe that comfort is what appeals to the reader solely however there will always be a degree of this yet i perceive that readers look for works which contain at their heart a story and characters that appeal to them it is in these areas that success is grown   interestingly moorcock mentions watership down at the same time as discussing the lord of the rings and both books are strong because they have characters which touch the reader they are not in any degree comforting because they contain frightening ideas and realities within them yet what they do is to show the reader truths about inner strength and the ability to overcome darkness tragedy and minor defeat all of which can sound like idealism or naivety yet fiction allows us to do such a thing  to perceive an idealistic view of what we can be  moorcock writes on however and mentions that tolkien uses his words seriously but without pleasure yet this misses much of what and how tolkien uses words certainly one can see how on the outside it could be seen that tolkien has a sort of unconscious humour and writes without pleasure but a linguistical analysis of the words and names shows that deeper down within the roots and origins of many words are humorous ideas for instance hobbit comes from old english words meaning hole and dweller  another of the criticisms levelled against tolkien is the existe
The Book Thief,just to clarify yes i did cry  ive read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book i can see why people wouldnt like it  i really can perhaps because i took a lot out of it personally i found i enjoyed it a lot  quick test to see if youll like this book   did you like anne of green gables  can you cope with an offbeat melancholy caustic deadpan selfrighteous narrator  do you like words questions  were all about what kind of underwear youre wearing so dont worry about them  so lets all gather around for story time with mistress kat  two incidents set me off lately   my neighbour came to me and complained about the islanders for those not australian the tongan fiji papa new guinea and new zealand populations of australia causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation  i was tooling around on facebook when i noticed one of my friends one of those friends youve never met except in an internet community hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the american people i wouldnt go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neohitler but lets just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned her comments on the video were that everything hed said was right it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that its about time somebody did something fuck me ive heard this phrase so many times what is it exactly that theyre referring to do they actually know ive yet to hear them pronounce what this something is or what it looks like is there some plan that im not aware of that theyre referring to does it involve chipmunks honey and tequila  to my neighbour i simply mumbled that i had to leave and got in my car i was offended on behalf of my friends so i blew him off and i havent really spoken to him since to my facebook friend i resisted the urge to make any comments i debated about starting a fight that would in all likelihood spill over to our community in the end i ignored her and i havent spoken to her since  the book thief is not your typical wwii story it doesnt even ask you to sympathize with the jews their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitifulbeautiful character of max this story actually focuses on the bad guys zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the jews he assumes that you feel for them that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesnt spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have  instead it focuses on the bad guys you get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in germany the thing is though that these arent really the bad guys zusak probably rightly assumes that wed never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad theyre not really bad after all they may be germans and they may have escaped persecution and death but theyre still poor theyre the tiny fraction of the german population who sympathizes with the jews they harbour a jewish man in their home and come to love him the thing is though that for most of the novel theyre not the good guys either they dont speak up for the jewish people they dont try to change popular opinion they dont stand for whats right they quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves  so you can see how i would sympathize how could i think that im one of the good guys when i dont stand up for people either shouldnt i have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the islanders were to blame for all the crime shouldnt i have asked him how many islanders he knew how he could make such assumptions about people shouldnt i have challenged my facebook friend shouldnt i have asked her why shes spreading propaganda couldnt i have probed her to think critically about this mans claims about facts and ethics  no i didnt want to cause problems and i didnt want to make waves  the narrator of the book thief makes a claim that hitlers took over a country and started a war  not with guns or weapons but with words ive read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but i actually agree with him  when i was a child i asked my great aunt nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality human nature ethics and theology her response was always the same if you dont fill a childs head with all the right stuff someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff its kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms those who stand for nothing fall for anything  well i agree when you dont educate people when you dont teach them to think critically with full understanding and proper knowledge then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot hitler told the german people how to think he told them who was wrong why they were wrong how to fix the wrong what was right then he did the most powerful thing a person could do he told them a story when you tell a whole nation a story about the future  a gloriously bright future with plenty and joy a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies a future in which they are happy and everything is as it should be  and if you tell that story well enough then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet  coincidently when you dont speak up when you dont proclaim the truth when youre too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then youre no better than an accomplice to a crime i cant imagine how my friends would feel if theyd known that i stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that pretty appalled i imagine  and rightfully so  and now we come to the big reason why i think a lot of people didnt like this book  the narrator  the hunger games did a similar thing to the book thief it sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame however as opposed to the book thief you didnt feel judged after all for the sins that the hunger games was preaching of were all guilty  and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability perhaps theres a sense that were all going down together when were damned at least well have good company right the book thief however singles you out as solely responsible it strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment  maybe im a glutton for punishment i dont mind being stripped down i dont mind being reprimanded and so i loved this book i loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues i loved this book because i loved the narrator i loved this book because i loved the story  i loved this book because i now have the perfect excuse to start a helluva lot more fights  for some reason that thought makes me very happy this is a book to treasure a new classic i absolutely loved it  set in germany in the years  the book thief tells the story of liesel narrated by death who has in his possession the book she wrote about these years so in a way they are both book thieves liesel steals randomly at first and later more methodically but shes never greedy death pockets liesels notebook after she leaves it forgotten in her grief amongst the destruction that was once her street her home and carries it with him  liesel is effectively an orphan she never knew her father her mother disappears after delivering her to her new foster parents and her younger brother died on the train to molching where the foster parents live death first encounters nineyearold liesel when her brother dies and hangs around long enough to watch her steal her first book the gravediggers handbook left lying in the snow by her brothers grave  her foster parents hans and rosa herbermann are poor germans given a small allowance to take her in hans a tall quiet man with silver eyes is a painter of houses etc and plays the accordian he teaches liesel how to read and write rosa is gruff and swears a lot but has a big heart and does laundry for rich people in the town liesel becomes best friends with her neighbour rudy a boy with hair the colour of lemons who idolises the black olympic champion sprinter jesse owens  one night a jew turns up in their home hes the son of a friend of hans from the first world war the man who taught him the accordian whose widowed wife hans promised to help if she ever needed it hans is a german who does not hate jews though he knows the risk he and his family are taking letting max live in the basement max and liesel become close friends and he writes an absolutely beautiful story for her called the standover man which damn near broke my heart its the story of max growing up and coming to liesels home and its painted over whitepainted pages of mein kampf which you can see through the paint  whenever i read a book i cannot help but read it in two ways the story itself and how its written theyre not quite inseparable but they definitely support each other with the book thief markus zusak has shown hes a writer of genius an artist of words a poet a literary marvel his writing is lyrical haunting poetic profound death is rendered vividly a lonely haunted being who is drawn to children who has had a lot of time to contemplate human nature and wonder at it liesel is very real a child living a childs life of soccer in the street stolen pleasures sudden passions and a full heart while around her bombs drop maimed veterans hang themselves bereaved parents move like ghosts gestapo take children away and the dirty skeletons of jews are paraded through the town  many things save this book from being allout depressing its never morbid for a start a lively humour dances through the pages and the richness of the descriptions as well as the richness of the characters hearts cannot fail to lift you up also its great to read such a balanced story where ordinary germans  even those who are blond and blueeyed  are as much at risk of losing their lives of being persecuted as the jews themselves  i cant go any further without talking about the writing itself from the very first title page you know youre in for something very special indeed the only way to really show you what i mean is to select a few quotes and i wish i was better at keeping track of lines i love  as he looked uncomfortably at the human shape before him the young mans voice was scraped out and handed across the dark like it was all that remained of him p  imagine smiling after a slap in the face then think of doing it twentyfour hours a day that was the business of hiding a jew p  the book was released gloriously from his hand it opened and flapped the pages rattling as it covered ground in the air more abruptly than expected it stopped and appeared to be sucked towards the water it clapped when it hit the surface and began to float downstream p  so many humans so many colours they keep triggering inside me they harass my memory i see them tall in their heaps all mounted on top of each other there is air like plastic a horizon like setting glue there are skies manufactured by people punctured and leaking and there are soft coalcoloured clouds beating like black hearts and then there is death making his way through all of it on the surface unflappable unwavering below unnerved untied and undone p  after ten minutes or so what was most prominent in the cellar was a kind of nonmovement their bodies were welded together and only their feet changed position or pressure stillness was shackled to their faces they watched each other and waited p  people and jews and clouds all stopped they watched as he stood max looked first at the girl and then stared directly into the sky who was wide and blue and magnificent there were heavy beams  planks of sun  falling randomly wonderfully onto the road clouds arched their backs to look behind as they started again to move on its such a beautiful day he said and his voice was in many pieces a great day to die a great day to die like this pp  writing like this is not something just anyone can do its true art only a writer of zusaks talent could make this story work and coud get away with such a proliferation of adjectives and adverbs to write in such a way as to revitalise the language and use words to paint emotion and a vivid visual landscape in a way youd never before encountered this is a book about the power of words and language and it is fitting that it is written in just such this way  the way this book was written also makes me think of a musical or an elaborate flamboyant stageplay its in the title pages for each part in deaths asides and manner of emphasing little details or even speech in the way death narrates giving us the ending at the beginning giving little melodrammatic pronouncements that make you shiver its probably the first book ive read that makes me feel how i feel watching the phantom of the opera if that helps explain itc update aug   this review has been here  years has  pages of  comments and  likes theres no outrage for you to add in the comments section that hasnt already been addressed if you want to talk about the book or why you liked it or anything else feel free  update feb   i wrote this review  years ago on a foreign keyboad so im well aware that i spelled chekhovs name wrong im not going to fix it so please dont drive my review further up in the rankings by commenting on the misspelling youre very dear but i know his name is anton and not antonin on that same note you dont need to add comments telling me that i didnt like the book because i dont know how to read and dont understand metaphors i actually have an ma in in english lit so i do know how to read  much better than you do in fact now quit bothering me before i go get my phd and then really turn into a credentialtouting ass  update july   to all jr high students who find themselves grossly offended by my review please remember that every time you leave a comment here you push my review up even higher in the rankings please save us both time and energy by not commenting thnx  this was the biggest piece of garbage ive ever read after the kite runner just as with the kite runner im somewhat shocked that this book is a bestseller and has been given awards chewed up and swallowed by the literary masses and regarded as greatness riiiight  the whole thing can be summed up as the story of a girl who sometimes steals books coming of age during the holocaust throw in the snarky narration by death nifty trick except that it doesnt work a few halfassed drawings of birdies and swastikas senseless and often laughable prose that sounds like it was pulled from the poetry journal of a selfimportant  yearold and a cast of characters that throughout are like watching cardboard cutouts walking around very slowly and thats the novel  here are some humble observations  first chances are that you mr zusak are not antonin chekhov you are therefore incapable of properly describing the weather for use as a literary device and you end up sounding like an asshole dont believe me  i like a chocolatecolored sky dark dark chocolate really do you now  the sky was dripping like a tap that a child has tried its hardest to turn off but hasnt quite managed really wow next youll tell me that the rain was like a shower im moved  oh how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky great obese clouds yes stupid obese clouds they need an education and a healthy diet  next chances are that you mr zusak are not william styron or any one of the other small handful of authors that can get away with holocaust fiction theyve done their research had some inkling of writing ability and were able to tell fascinating stories you invented a fake town in germany probably so you didnt have to do any research and told a longwinded and poorlywritten story and in  pages you couldnt even make it to  so you sloppily dropped off and wrapped it up in  whats the point of writing historical fiction if you cant even stay within the basic confines of that hisotrical event for me this does nothing more than trivialize the mass murder of over  million people maybe thats why a  yearold australian shouldnt write about the holocaust but thats just me moving on  but what really makes this book expensive toilet paper is the bad writing which is to be found not just in bizarre descriptions of the weather but really on every page some personal favorites  the breakfast colored sun  somewhere inside her were the souls of words  the oldened young man wtf  he crawled to a disfigured figure  her words were motionless  it smelled like friendship remind me to sniff my friends next time i see them  a multitude of words and sentences were at her fingertips huh  pinecones littered the ground like cookies  sigh  all of this is quite funny coming from a book where the main character supposedly learns the importance of words further i love that the protagonist comes to the conclusion that hitler would be nothing without words really really would hitler be nothing without words what about selfloathing misplaced blame and hatred an ideology xenophobia charisma an army and a prideinjured nation willing to listen dont those count for something  the shitstorm comes to an end when a bomb lands on our fictional town wiping out everyone save for the sometimes bookthief main character of course because weak writers who dont know how to end their story just kill everyone off for a clean break and some nice emotional manipulation written for maximum tearjerking effect our main character spews out some great lines when she sees the death and destruction around her  to her dead mother god damn it you were so beautiful  to her dead best friend as she shakes him wake up i love you wake up didnt i see the same thing in that movie my girl  then she profoundly notes that her dead father was a man with silver eyes not dead ones  and this kind of angsty adolescent prose just never ended it went on and on to form the one longass senseless disjointed story  but thats ok take it all the junk give it a quirky narrator an obscure and mysterious title throw in a jew on the run from nazis who likes to draw silly pictures of birds and swastikas and market it all as holocaust lit ahh the packaging of bullshit makes for such a sweet best seller  swallow it down america put it on the shelf next to the kite runner you love this you live for this  sucked when death captures me the boy vowed he will feel my fist on his face personally i quite like that such stupid gallantry yes i like that a lot  a few days ago when i was starting the book thief my mother stopped by and saw the book on my coffee table having just read it herself and knowing me better than anyone else in the world i might add she was determined to save me from myself she did her very best to convince me not to read it she described in detail the three day long headache all the crying had caused her and the heartache she now has to live with but im nothing if not stubborn i guess i never learned to listen to my mother im pretty sure her parting sentence was dont come crying to me and i didnt i huddled in a corner and cried inconsolably instead  death himself narrates the story about a little girl named liesel growing up with her foster parents in nazi germany at the beginning i felt somewhat intimidated by the idea of death as a narrator i assumed that his voice would be dark and thunderous but for the most part he was a ray of light illuminating earths saddest time incredibly insightful observations and occasional dry humor are only some of the things no one but death could have brought into this story besides we hear people calling gods name every day for many reasons but when death calls to him in despair and even those calls fall on deaf ears no one can fail to understand the gravity of the situation  i do not carry a sickle or a scythe i only wear a hooded black robe when its cold and i dont have those skulllike facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance you want to know what i truly look like ill help you out find yourself a mirror while i continue   the book thief is not one of those books you read compulsively desperate to find out whats on the next page no it is in fact better to read it slowly in small doses in a way that allows you to savor every word and absorb the power and the magic it contains all the while you know whats going to happen death has no patience for mysteries however anticipation of the inevitable makes it even worse my whole body was tingling with fear because i knew what was coming and i knew that it was only a matter of time zusak found a way to give a fresh approach to a muchtold story he offered a glimpse at the other side of the coin really should we feel sorry for the people hiding in a basement in munich suburbs sure bombs are falling on their heads but most of them are members of the nazi party willingly or reluctantly some of them truly think that jews are no better than rats some on the other hand are hiding a jew in their own basement some are just innocent children but the more important question is are we any better at all if we dont feel compassion and sorrow death does a great job of asking all these questions in a calm unobtrusive way  im not pretentious enough to believe that my clumsy words can ever do this book justice i wont even try time will speak for it as im pretty sure it will survive for decades and generations to come the book thief and markus zusak should find their place in every school textbook all over the world   seven thousand stars could never be enough for this book i put off reading this book for the library book club here are my three reasons for doing so   its a young adult book i am an adult it cant be that good if its written for young people  its about the holocaust and i think weve all heard enough about that the author will probably even focus on colors among the grays as in schindlers list  i have way too many other books to read  after avoiding the book for as long as possible i sat down hoping to enjoy it enough to gain some clever comments for the book group  turns out most of my concerns were right but one other thing was also true this book rocks  the first thing any review will say about this book is that it is narrated by death so i might as well get it out of the way death the hooded one the angel of the night narrates he is very busy during the war years as you might expect some people claim this is a mere gimmick and that the story is strong enough as it is  i agree that this is a strong story it moves like a sailboat on a brisk day but i think the choice to tell it through death was a good one death foreshadows constantly so we know a bit about which of the characters will die instead of ruining the shock value this heightened my anticipation and dread and isnt that how people feel during war they know some of them are bound to die they know they will lose loved ones its one long hellish wait to see how it will turn out  its also an unusual take on the holocaust because it focuses on liesel an orphaned german girl living in hitlers birthplace liesel the book thief and the other characters in this book are rich interesting and wily i say wily because at points in the book you hate them but they change and you grow to love them for instance liesels adopted mother is a foulmouthed abusive sharp woman spoiler when liesels adopted father is shipped off to war however liesel creeps through the house to see rosa sleeping with her husbands accordian strapped around her waist rosas changes prove one of the greatest reasons to read good literature to get insight into the type of people we dont usually give a second chance i am apparently one of the few people who just do not see what all of the hype is about on this one i was really excited to read this after all of the glowing reviews it got but i was left extremely disappointed i found the writing stilted and stuttering hard to stutter in writing but this book pulls it off overly sentimental and heavyhanded on the symbolism  i also found the authors approach to the story to be just plain gimmicky the first and foremost gimmick also see heavyyhanded symbolism is that the story is narrated by death now this might work in some books but not this one the choice of narrator adds absolutely nothing to the story it is only a distraction to the reader and it also encouraged the author to add trite observations about deaths perspective for example he doesnt carry a scythe but likes the human image that add nothing to the story if death here had been given developed personality or a unique perspective then maybe and even then its a stretch the choice of narrator would have worked as it is the story is told almost entirely as though by an omniscient narrator is death omniscient and we get absolutely nothing from the choice of death to fill the role its a gimmick and it falls flat  the other gimmick i found most distracting these are not the only two but they are the most egregious is the repeated use of little newsflashtype bold and centered notes that appear periodically through the story to highlight some stupid point and add in the authors mind dramatic effect these newsflashes as i think of them were irritating and served only to break up the natural narrative flow without adding anything significant this is another example of the author hitting the reader over the head with his points rather than trusting his own writing to get the message across this is another illconceived and heavyhanded gimmick intended to correct for a poor narrative  i think it is telling that while this book gets listed as teen fiction zusak actually wrote it for adults for some reason it got identified as being for teens when it got marketed in the us it was written in australia it seems to me that the explanation for this change is that the novel feels like it was written by a very immature author and so the prose does not attain the quality one should expect of adult fiction  i think good holocaust stories need to be told but the book thief fails at that endeavor the story is trite the narrative is sentimental and uninspired i recommend that you look elsewhere for something better if you want something for younger readers try number the stars by lois lowry if youre a bit older also read night by elie weisel or the diary of anne frank i might even add in fahrenheit  by ray bradbury to counteract the heavyhanded bookburning theme of the book thief theres plenty more out there that better deserve your time and attention than does this book i hate it when this happens i truly do  it makes me feel wrong inside when everyone else loves a book that i find to be underwhelming i mean whats wrong with me did i not get it obviously it must be a lack of intelligence or something because everyone seems to rate this  stars i was looking through my friend reviews hoping that someone would share my opinion  at least a tiny bit  and seeing  stars  stars  stars  stars  i can appreciate that markus zusak is a very talented writer some of the phrases he uses are beautiful and highly quotable  more reminiscent of poetry than prose and the story idea a tale narrated by death and set in nazi germany original and ominous  but it was the storytelling that never really worked for me this is one of those incredibly slow subtle books that are told in a series of anecdotes and are meant to cleverly build up a bigger picture but the stories just didnt interest me  i could imagine i was reading a collection of short stories and not a fulllength novel about playground fights developing friendships wwi stories and death the book felt almost episodic in nature  these stories are supposed to come together and form a novel that is all kinds of awesome but it was so bland i also think that nearly  pages of subtlety can make you want to throw yourself off the nearest tall building anyone read to the lighthouse and spend  of it just wishing theyd get to the effin lighthouse  im giving this book  stars for the pretty words and the concept but other than that this book unfortunately wont stay with me i find it an easily forgettable novel im sorry i give this  stars but there is a disclaimer if you want a fast read this book is not for you if you only like happy endings this book is not for you if you dont like experimental fiction this book is not for you  if you love to read and if you love to care about the characters you read about and if you love to eat words like theyre ice cream and if you love to have your heart broken and mended on the same page this book is for you  this story is narrated by death during world war ii and it is the story of a young german girl who comes of age during one of the most horrific times in recent history death has a personality if something bad is about to happen death warns you ahead of time my favorite part is when he stomps on a framed picture of hitler on his way to retrieve a thousand souls from a bomb raid death is trying to understand the human race as much as the humans are when his job becomes unbearable he watches the color of the sky as he gathers the souls and carries them away the descriptions of the sky are like nothing ive ever read  a few quotes in years to come he would be a giver of bread not a stealer  proof again of the contradictory human being so much good so much evil just add water p  the town that afternoon was covered in a yellow mist which stroked the rooftops as if they were pets and filled up the streets like a bath p  he was more a black suit than a man his face was a mustache p  he does something to me that boy every time its his only detriment he steps on my heart he makes me cry p  there was once a strange small man he decided three important details about his life  he would part his hair from the opposite side to everyone else  he would make himself a small strange mustache  he would one day rule the world yes the fuhrer decided that he would rule the world with words  its going to take awhile for this book to fully sink in but overall this was a masterpiece i feel like i was just given a history lesson but in the most emotionally damaging way possible the book thief was published as young adult novel dont you believe it this is a wonderful novel appropriate for adults of young middle and advanced years my wife was shedding copious tears as she finished reading the book and insisted that i read it immediately how could i not i was prepared for a moving read and was not disappointed  description sophie nlisse as liesel meminger  from tv guide  the main character is liesel meminger just shy of ten years old when we first meet her it is preww ii germany her father has been transported for being a kommunist while en route with her mother and brother werner to be handed over to foster parents hans and rosa hubermann her brother dies at his burial she retrieves a book dropped by one of the gravediggers a connection to her brother and begins her career as a book thief the hubermanns live on himmell heaven street in the town of molching outside munich rosa is a coarse foulmouthed woman hans is a warm supportive papa they come to form a very devoted loving family the story follows liesels coming of age meeting other children particularly her bff rudy making friends seeing reflected in the actions of her peers and the events that occur in the town the horrors of the age but there is much more to this portrait of a german town than the bullies one expects to grow into the expected abusive stereotypes there is hope as well for those who are dragged into the military against their wishes for those who harbor fugitive jews at great personal risk for those who stand up against the abuse of the weak for those who share a love of knowledge with those eager to learn there is sadness as some cannot live with what they have seen what they have lost  description nico liersch as rudy steiner  from imglistcom  the book thief is populated with a klatch of wonderful characters the spirited liesel will win your heart as will her friend rudy hans and even rosa there are other characters who will also pluck those strings you will be rooting for this one or that one cheering victories and weeping at defeats having characters one comes to care for is the greatest strength of th

absolutely stunning book  this is my third time through and each time i am blown away by janes strength of character with every twist life hurled at her jane merely straightened her shoulders adjusted her pack and trudged on  each time i read this novel i notice something different this time it was how much charlotte bronte slipped her own beliefs into the novel precisely as men would suffer and it is narrowminded in their more privileged fellowcreatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockingsit is thoughtless to condemn them or laugh at them if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex it made for a truly eyeopening reread  the abc reading challenge  j  audiobook comments read by nadia may i may be the only one with this  but whenever i read a really old novel i find it much easier to listen to opposed to reading a copy i spend less time puzzling out the language and unfamiliar terms and more time enjoying the story i highly recommend listening to this book if youve tried reading it and just couldnt get into it i feel like an ass saying this but who actually thinks this is a cute romance what the actual f  now that this is out of the way  i did like jane as a character and i also liked the portion of the book about her childhood but the two romances were train wrecks and if i hear anyone say they love m rochester i will forever judge you  pride and prejudice  jane eyre  there i said it i could bang mr rochester like a screen door till next tuesday thats not all i got from this book honestly jane be still dont struggle so like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation  i am no bird and no net ensnares me i am a free human being with an independent will which i now exert to leave you  i am glad that in  charlotte bronte made the decision to publish her novel under a male pseudonym currer bell had a much better chance of being published than charlotte bronte and with reviewers and readers assuming that she was in fact a male writer allowed the novel a chance to be weighed properly without prejudice jane eyre became a bestseller the question is of course would the novel have been so successful or even published at all if charlotte bronte had been emblazoned on the cover i like to think that some editor would have realized the bloody brilliance of the story and would have published it anyway even if they didnt spend any money on promoting it would readers have bought it hopefully word would have trickled out about how compelling the plot was and people would have overcome their natural prejudice for reading a novel by a woman  so isnt it fun that charlotte tricked everyone including her own father she did not confess her efforts to him until she had become successful even writing these words i have a smile on my face thinking of this successful bamboozlement of publishers editors and readers  the story of course is larger than the book most people with any kind of inquisitive nature have been exposed to the bare bones of this novel without ever reading the book maybe they watched a movie based on the book or maybe they have heard it referenced once read it is impossible for people not to use aspects of this novel as common reference points for other readers  take mr edward fairfax rochester himself the master of thornfield hall he is a brooding complicated dark and intelligent creature he is a force of nature who conforms the world around him with every stride he takes or every word that drops from his lips he is the embodiment of the lord byron character it doesnt matter that he is not handsome he is powerful women swoon in his presence and after a carefully administered smelling salt might start calculating what he is worth a year  rochester is completely taken by jane eyre practically from the moment they meet the drama of their meeting is one of those great cinematic scenes in the history of literature bronte incorporates many scenes into the novel that are frankly gifts to future movie renditions rochester has never met anyone quite like her he is not alone everyone who comes into contact with jane eyre knows they have met a unique person she is a kind and pleasant person but she will not brook any discriminations against her character  mrs reed her aunt mr brocklehurst director of lowood school attended by jane mr st john eyre rivers minister who asks to marry her and even mr rochester all attempt to conform jane to the acceptable deferring victorian woman of the time to call this a feminist novel does put it in a box which constrains it too tightly jane or charlotte either one would loosen those bindings and let it breath as charlottes intentions with this novel go well beyond the confines of any specific genre i found her ideas of female equality embodied so wonderfully in the character of jane inspiring women are supposed to be very calm generally but women feel just as men feel they need exercise for their faculties and a field for their effort as much as their brothers do they suffer from too rigid a restraint too absolute a stagnation precisely as men would suffer and it is narrowminded in their more privileged fellowcreatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the piano and embroidering bags it is thoughtless to condemn them or laugh at them if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex  i hear you charlotte  can you imagine the impact of such words on your typical victorian housewife a woman who has lived her whole life being the daughter of her father the wife of her husband the mother of her sons she has been passed from the care of one man after another if she were fortunate enough to be born pretty she has that brief moment of power when suiters contend for her hand but probably ultimately her father would decide who was best for her to marry how about the impact of reading this novel on the typical victorian man did he look up from this book and peer over at his wife she looking rosy in the firelight knitting away at some frivolous thing and thinkdoes she want more or maybe he sees his pretty daughter enter the room on the verge of womanhood and does he consider the possibility that she wants or deserves more  there is no spark of revolution inspired by this book but i do hope that this book may have chipped away at some of the archaic ideas of inequality maybe a few women readers realized that some of those secret desires they have harbored their whole life were not such strange concepts when jane stands up to the conformists she encounters she is willing to take the punishment because she knows in her soul that what she believes about herself is incontestable  this is no better illustrated than in her interactions with im sorry to say this because it isnt completely fair the odious st john eyre rivers he wants to marry her but only for the sake that he believes she will make a wonderful useful missionary wife he doesnt love her she is willing to go but only as a sister not as a wife jane refuses to compromise but there is this moment where she is teetering in the balance im mentally screaming to her at this point i shuddered as he spoke i felt his influence in my marrowhis hold on my limbs he is a cold man who would have gladly marched our jane off to some godforsaken part of the world to die some horrible death from disease or from simple neglect  i know the plot and yet im still completely invested in every scene there is always the possibility that ive fallen into an alternative universe and i am reading some other version of jane eyre with a completely different ending i can assure everyone this did not happen  when jane is residing with mrs read she describes her place to sleep as a small closet i cant help but think of the closet under the stairs at  privet drive like harry potter she is also an orphan but still with a rebellious streak because she is also sure that she is supposed to be someone other than who she is currently perceived to be the relief she experiences when she learns she is getting away from the condescending attitude of the read house and going away to school at lowood also reminds me of harrys relief to discover he too is escaping to hogwarts though i must say harry despite the trials and tribulations he experiences draws a better straw than miss jane  i really enjoyed the gothic elements those were to a degree completely unexpected oh sir i never saw a face like it it was a discoloured faceit was a savage face i wish i could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments  ghost are usually pale jane  this sir was purple the lips were swelled and dark the brow furrowed the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes shall i tell you of what it reminded me  you may  of the foul german spectrethe vampyre  there are noises in the night at thornfield hall there is an unknown tenant locked away in the rafters of the house there are secrets there are unexpected fires there are scandals waiting to be known in fact the twists of the plot were considered so outrageous for the time that the book acquired a reputation for being improper this helped to boost sales further  the bronte family was very close they grew up conceiving their own stories and fantasies and acting them out in impromptu plays all three girls and the brother branwell were writers tragically they all died young charlotte outlived them all dying in  at the age of  with her unborn child branwell  and emily  both passed away in  and anne died the following year at the age of  can you imagine having to bury all your siblings it must have felt like the spectre of death was stalking the brontes  what makes rochester unique is that he does eventually see jane the way she sees herself fair as a lily and not only the pride of his life but the desire of his eyes i will remember that line desire of his eyes for a long time she is a hidden gem in rooms full of people charlotte bronte makes some good points through janes eyes at how unaware wealthy people are of the true natures of those who serve them  i would talk about the love story but what is there to say it is one for the ages i would say that charlotte bronte never found her rochester in real life but some letters have come to light written to a man named constantin hger that suggests that maybe she did he was married to someone else and when elizabeth gaskell wrote the biography of her friend she carefully edited out those very revealing letters of a love that could never be  jane eyre may you always find the readers you deserve   certainly one of the best novels ever written  the kind of novel that makes one believe in love again  or at least desire to hold on to the illusion  likely my favourite read for   for the time being just basking and swooning  inebriated  speechless  i know its out of fashion and a trifle uncool but i cant help it im a romantic fool  this is my sixth time reading jane eyre although twice at school and every time i read it i get something different from the story however this is the first time reviewing and the first time i have challenged myself to explaining why this story means so much to me apart from it being the first classic book i ever fell in love with which will always have its rightful place in my book history no film adaption has done it justice and no words that i write can capture the beauty that lies within these pages of course i can write words so inspiring is this book but cannot express how i truly feel with this book the way charlotte bronte can write with such rawness i also need to restrict myself to covering the key themes and elements otherwise i would be writing a book about a book so first up is the character development  jane eyre sets the bar in character development and is one of the best i have ever read for this there is nothing left to the imagination and the explicit way emotions and feelings are portrayed is remarkable sentimental but also appropriate the character traits of the two key male characters rochester and st john are evocative and ignite frustration and even slight anger in the reader one man would turn his back on the laws of god and society for the love of the young jane whilst the other obsessive and devout has expectations of selfsacrifice for god his own vanity and ambition  whilst different both men possess the same unwavering sense of entitlement and lack humility and understanding when they offer jane a life contrary to her beliefs honour and feelings st john says to her   you are formed for labour not for love a missionarys wife you mustshall be you shall be mine i claim younot for my pleasure but for my sovereigns service  while rochesters disregard of what jane represents is equally as distasteful he does draw sympathy from the reader because there are displays of kindness towards others and his love for jane is unquestionable if not selfish once again it is janes response that ignited a wave of emotions in me  laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation they are for such moments as this when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour  feminism religion and class are constant themes through the novel where the eponymous jane tells her own story if you consider the period in which this book was written the content and storyline the uninhibited expressions of love and anger as well as the uncensored view of feminism then you can begin to appreciate just how incredibly provocative this book might have been on many occasions jane describes herself as someones equal not to be caged in a social class nor defined by societys expectation of the role of women it is this freedom of expression independence of mind and moral commitment that consumed me so much in this story  i am no bird and no net ensnares me i am a free human being with an independent will  at this point i reveal that the reason i love this book so much is because of jane eyres character it is the most extraordinary story about an ordinary young woman although a heroine in my eyes a woman guided by honour influenced and dedicated but not cosseted by religion an independent woman who is highly principled and determined yet loving and generous and passionate but not vindicative a young woman who wants to live love and think freely and in that lies the beauty of this book how groundbreaking daring and courageous from the incredibly gifted charlotte bronte  second to that is the uninhibited depiction of the characters their emotions and the inner battles they must conquer in the face of temptation all of this of course is brought to life with brontes perfectly chosen words vivid descriptions and unbridled but elegant prose there is such a rawness to the writing although some would say overly dramatic but for me it is another beautiful and remarkable aspect to this book because it works  jane eyre is a book that is bold for the way it inspires feminism courageous in the way it challenges the accepted norms of society and religion but is also respectful there is beauty in the storytelling sincerity in these righteous but flawed characters and artistry in the way the themes have been woven into the story  an epic masterpiece in literature  i have for the first time found what i can truly lovei have found you you are my sympathymy better self my good angel says rochester  and my gr friends i too have found in books what i truly love and it is this timeless classic that is likely to remain as my  book of all time for all time in the dawn of a new year in books what better way to have started my new reading year than with jane eyre the principled loving feminist and her story i read this book back in high school i hated it i thought it was boring and stupid and all i wanted to do was spread the word that this book was terrible and no one should read it i had it marked one star on goodreads and it had a home on my least favorite shelf  well i have been waiting years to find the perfect place to use this gif    i reread in late august early september  i have to say that i should probably reread everything i read bank in high school to get a better perspective  i enjoyed the book quite a bit this time the story in intricate and dark jane eyre is a tragic hero who does her best through the whole book but keeps encountering unfortunate situation after unfortunate situation the story held my interest a lot more than some other classic novels i have read  my only complaint was a few times certain plot points were belabored i found myself saying okay i get it lets move on  so everyone if you remember a book from your youth with less than enthusiastic fondness it might be worth giving it another shot you never know what you might find mr rochester walked so every other tall dark handsome and broody male character could run and thats the that on that  i really dont have much else to add that hasnt already been said about this book considering its been around for  years but i will admit how impressed i am with how modern this story feels i think thats a key factor in why i enjoyed this so much  because it doesnt feel like a classic to me  not only is the writing very accessible and incredibly easy to read which i dont find to the case for most books written during this time period but the dialogue between characters is very forward thinking the conversations between jane and mr rochester are very much similar to conversations that are happening today i really admire how bronte incorporates feminist ideals into this story and i honestly didnt expect the lowkey thriller vibes present in some parts so that was fun  overall this is a great story  would recommend for years ive been saying that jane eyre is my favorite novel of all time and that it is the character of jane is to me one of the most admirable and appealing fictional characters of all time poor and plain she may be but her spirit is indomitable  in an era when women were expected to be brainless and ornamental jane through the words of charlotte bronte refused to bow to those expectations the novel is a firstperson narrative from the perspective of the title character  the novels setting is somewhere in the north of england late in the reign of george iii   it goes through five distinct stages  janes childhood at gateshead hall where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins  her education at lowood school where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression  her time as governess at thornfield hall where she falls in love with her mysterious employer edward rochester  her time with the rivers family during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin st john rivers proposes to her  and ultimately her reunion with and marriage to her beloved rochester spoiler alert you may not want to read this review if you plan on reading jane eyre  i read jane eyre for the first time as an adult and i cant help but feel sorry for every junior high or high school student who was forced to read this book  i thought getting through this book was very difficult i assumed i would love it since i generally love books by jane austen but i didnt find many similarities at all jane eyre was boring and unbelievable i did enjoy the first half of the book because i had such hope for her but then it just became dull and unrealistic i never bought the romance between jane and mr rochester nor did i buy the coincidence of her happening to arrive on the doorstep of the only relations she has in all of england during her time of need i also find it strange that she dedicates the last paragraphs of the book primarily to st john rivers when he was such a small part of her life not to mention the fact that the part he did play was primarily negative  bronte failed to draw me into the lives of these characters or like them frankly which made this a very long read for me one of the most beloved novels in history for many generations  jane eyre is set in england in the s  the story of a neglected girl orphan of that name who never gives up her dream of happiness no matter how remote a possibility this goal can ever be reached hated by her cruel aunt mrs sarah reed not a blood relative and cousins eliza jealous of her more beautiful but spiteful sister georgiana and abused by them both they look down at the beggar this little poor girl this imposition why is she here  they show every day their contempt not even bothering to hide it  it would be so nice everyone thinks if jane wasnt there her miserable tormented life seems everlasting no escape where would she go  and treated like a lowly servant not a loved relative she the orphan has to keep her feelings to herself bessie the nurse maid is the only person that treats miss eyre kindly secretly of course the frosty aunt very reluctantly raised jane until the age of ten then gladly mrs reed sends the unwanted prepubescent jane  to a charity school lowoods run by a clergyman the tyrannical mr brocklehurst he forgot the teachings of jesus  harshly treated there too as are the other students jane is hungry and cold often by the director brocklehurst a man that believes in discipline except for his own luxury loving family  jane grows up a lonely woman with few friends only one in fact fellow student helen here for a short time she hopes there has to be something better than mere existence leaving the horrible school after eight long years the last two as a teacher the teenager gets a job as a lowly and paid little governess  in a gloomy mansion far away her new master is the rather distant and frightening mr edward fairfax rochester a mysterious man that spends little time at home jane becomes attractive to the not very attractive rochester many questions are left unaccountably unanswered at thornfield hall the little girl adele the governess teaches and takes care of sometimes along with her french nurse sophie is she rochesters child or just his ward  those strange horrific noises up on the third floor  dreadful devilish and inhuman laughs in the middle of the night what is causing them  how did the owner of the house make all his money  will rochester marry the beautiful but greedy woman blanche ingram she despises miss eyre and make her leave thornfield hall will the plain jane ever find a place to call her own and find love and contentment  this classic book written by one of the brilliant but short lived bronte sisters charlotte will not disappoint readers of great literature still worth the effort after more than a century and a half of its existence  it will continue for who knows how long    the brontes fuelled my love for reading and convinced me that the classics werent all mean nasty books that fascist teachers made you read in school just to torture you i grew up with austen and dickens whom i loved but the brontes always seemed to come out on top for some reason jane eyre is my second favourite after wuthering heights i love the darkness and sadness of their novels but the more quiet style than youd find in dickenss wild tales of orphans drunks and epic family betrayals i probably read this first when i was about  and loved books like what katy did at school and the malory towers series im not sure if i loved the books as any little girl might or because i wanted to go away to school to escape my motherdidnt want to go away to school because i would feel abandoned  my mother didnt love me and wanted me to go to boarding school there was a very good one in the nearest city i lived in a village about  miles away my father wouldnt hear of it he went to work in the city every day and i remember him saying to my mother how would i feel if i was left there and he came home every day they had a big row which i overheard and my mother suggested a compromise that i come home at weekends my father wouldnt go for that either  then i was supposed to go to cheltenham ladies college but after a brief interview they declined to have the third member of my family the other two cousins one on my fathers and one on my mothers and coincidentally we all have variations of the same first name had both been expelled probably about boys i forget now but we were all early developers that way and we werent like really wellbehaved either being expelled runs in the family me too several times and my brother but he was expelled from hebrew school only he put a firecracker in the headmasters desk which my father had also done and also got expelled for but we didnt know it until my brother got into trouble  i didnt want to go and not be with my father who loved me but i did want to go and get away from my mother and to some extent my younger brother the golden child who didnt have to do anything no chores nothing and got everything he wanted that was rubbed in by the housekeeper we had a livein housekeeper who never lost an opportunity to show how much contempt she felt for me she made my brothers bed washed his underwear hung up his clothes and shined his shoes as she did for my parents bu tnot me it wasnt that the chores were onerous it was that i was the only one in the house excluded from having them done  my father though had hated boarding school he was expelled from several he used to run away he had a strange upbringing he also lived in a village and there were boy cousins there was only one girl in his generation of a lot of boys in another village and a lot more in the city whenever any of them got into trouble they would just go and stay with an aunt instead of going home he told me no one really minded who turned up at the dinner table and they were always ready with excuses so then he would get away with having run away for a couple of days until the school called his mother my grandmother who loved me very much and she would have to track him down and there would be hell to pay  on his third school he wrote the classic note of novels i saw it and wished i owned it he wrote to his mother dont try to find me i have gone and joined the army she went and got him back and persuaded the school to take him back he hated school he wanted to be a farmer and went to agricultural college rather than university but on his fathers death had to join the family company so my father was really keen on not sending me away and not forcing me into a career i really didnt want  so in jane eyre going to boarding school i could see myself as the outcast the one who wasnt accepted the outcast the plain girl as my mother was always rubbing in fat plain awful hair thunderthighs and best dressed in brown grey bottle green or navy never pink red or flower prints so i felt like jane i identified with her although i was a hair model in my teens and later in films i never felt more than adequatelooking until my s when i started to see myself in a more positive light i thought if i could get away maybe i could become part of a group people would like me i also thought i could get away from the endless berations of my faults and the accompanying beatings  i reread it at about  and understood the book much more ive probably read it and its prequel jean rhyss wide sargasso sea half a dozen times jean rhys was from dominica an island i know well when i was first there her family home in roseau had become a guest house and that was where i stayed  not much of a review of an excellent book but it was why i loved it so much whew i finished this one this morning and im glad i finally read it i cant say however that i enjoyed it would recommend it or will ever read it again not in this lifetime anyway  description  for starters i didnt like jane yeah when she was a kid i felt sorry for her but the older she got the less i liked her her religious convictions and the decisions she made because of them had bertha looking like the picture of sanity by comparison speaking of why in the world did she wander off in the middle of the night with no money what did she think would happen was manna supposed to drop out of heaven and i dont buy that an educated sensible woman would just run off into the night without taking enough with her to make sure she could survive an idiot would have better sense than that but by the end of the story i was almost wishing she had wandered off after st john and contracted some disease the fact that she didnt totally realize what an awful freak st john was nailed the lid on her coffin to me even at the very end of the book she kept talking about all of the great works he was doing for god  description  seriously he was an ass and i would have told him to give me my five thousand pounds back at least bronte had the sense to kill him off at the end well maybe he wasnt quite dead yet but he was on his way to meet his maker ugh i also thought it was more than just a teeny bit fishy that she ended up on the doorstep of the only family she had in the entire world exactly how likely is that not very  description  then there is the man himself mr rochester he wasnt anything to write home about for sure lets start with the obvious shall we he was cold condescending secretive wow oh yeah and he was ugly to boot yum  description  can anything else be said about him to make him more of a catch i know just in case lets have him keep a drooling homicidal wife hidden away in the attic personally i think bronte had covered all the bases at this point did he honestly not see anything wrong with letting her marry him while he had that crazy bat of a wife locked upstairs if he had just told her the situation to start with i might have liked him a little better nah probably not i never actually figured out what she saw in him my best guess ended up being low selfesteem coupled with a bad childhood  description  the gothic mystery part of the plot ended in the middle of the book and shortly thereafter ended anything remotely interesting say what you will about looney bertha but at least she pumped some life into the story  description  and wasnt it just awesome that bertha burned the house to the ground and then leaped to her death nice exit big girl i gotta say she was by far my favorite lest we forget she also managed to mangle rochesters good looks even more before she bowed out now janes man looks like a oneeyed onearmed flying purple people eater of course she doesnt mind because now she feels she can be of use to him  description  jane i can tell we will never see eyetoeye on things so ill just let it go our friendship was never meant to be for some you will forever remain the stoic heroine who finally gets her happily ever after for me you are just a ninny with bad taste in men as adele would say adieu reader this review is over reader gaze upon my tortured physiognomy and answer me one question that i shall pose to thee in the langu
"The Chronicles of Narnia (Chronicles of Narnia, #1-7)",when the lionwitchwardrobe movie came out a while ago some dude accosted me and said dude the fucking right wing media is trying to say that the narnia books are all about fucking christianity  no shit i figured that out when i was   but who cares if you cant enjoy these books at all there is no child alive inside of you and if youve got no child inside you youre not very much fun at all are you i love narnia of course its not perfect but they are such wonderful stories paving the way for so many other fantasy worlds that followed sure theyve got the allegorical christian background and some of lewis wording and phrases wouldnt pass as politically correct now but if you can look past these small details narnia is a truly magical place the stories iconic i will never forget them  the magicians nephew  by gum said digory dont i just wish i was big enough to punch your head  the creation story of narnia young polly and diggory are swept up in the experiments of a magician attempting to find other worlds in doing so they discover the beginning of narnia and so start off the tales  the lion the witch and the wardrobe  course he isnt safe but hes good hes the king i tell you  the most well known of the narnian chronicles peter susan edmund and lucy discover narnia through the back of a wardrobe their battles with the white witch are legendary  the horse and his boy  do not by any means destroy yourself for if you live you may yet have good fortune but all the dead are dead alike  this one though based when the pevensie children are still in narnia the focus is on two young calormene children shasta and aravis having both run away  they seek a better life in narnia becoming involved in a battle between the narnians and the calormenes  prince caspian  but things never happen the same way twice it has been hard for us all in narnia before now  the pevensie children return to narnia after a gap of several hundred years though to the children only  year of our time has passed they aid the rightful heir to the throne in his attempts to stop his evil uncle from destroying narnia  the voyage of the dawn treader  a swashbuckling tale full of adventures only edmund and lucy return this time taking with them their dreadful cousin eustace they land on the deck of a ship with prince caspian  on a journey to find  missing dukes  the silver chair  he was not a perfectly enormous giant that is to say he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole  eustace returns with a school friend jill to find the missing prince whose disappearance has led to numerous others going missing in search of him their journey takes them to the land of giants and to the world underground also the best character  puddleglum the marsh wiggle is in this one i love him  the last battle  all worlds draw to an end and that noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy  a fantastic conclusion an evil ape is using trickery and deceit to cause the narnians to live in fear this is the battle to end all battles and none will be the same again   stars narnia is a wonderful place with the most incredible cast of characters like i said it certainly has flaws but its achievements overcome those big time  all their life in this world and all their adventures in narnia had only been the cover and the title page now at last they were beginning chapter one of the great story which no one on earth has read which goes on for ever in which every chapter is better than the one before the chronicles of narnia chronicles of narnia  cs lewis  the chronicles of narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels by c s lewis  it is considered a classic of childrens literature and is the authors bestknown work having sold over  million copies in  languages  written by lewis illustrated by pauline baynes and originally published in london between  and  the chronicles of narnia has been adapted several times complete or in part for radio television the stage and film  set in the fictional realm of narnia a fantasy world of magic mythical beasts and talking animals the series narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of that world  except in the horse and his boy the protagonists are all children from the real world magically transported to narnia where they are called upon by the lion aslan to protect narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful line  the books span the entire history of narnia from its creation in the magicians nephew to its eventual destruction in the last battle  books of chronicles of narnia  the lion the witch and the wardrobe  prince caspian the return to narnia  the voyage of the dawn treader  the silver chair  the horse and his boy  the magicians nephew  the last battle  i discovered the chronicles of narnia when i was six years old halfway through my first year of school i had discovered the joys of our school library and i still remember the day and the exact shelf where i found the lion the witch and the wardrobe it was the lowest shelf the one that rested on the ground and i had to crouch down to wiggle the book out from amongst its peers by the time id finished first grade id read them all and searched high and low for any book series that could be as wonderful and magical as this one had been  now i could dismiss my love of these books as some quaint childhood memory that i was unwilling to let go of certainly that is a factor however the magic has never faded ive read them all so many times that ive memorized them ive memorized them so thoroughly that ive told them as bed time stories to children that ive done baby sitting for children who have loved the stories and begged to go to bed early so that they could hear more about diggory and polly or lucy peter edmund and susan or more about shasta and avaris and so on and so forth  its not just children either my husband and i read a book a proper book for half an hour for our son every night for the past month that has been the chronicles of narnia its gotten to the point where he doesnt want to stop our sons bedtime comes and goes and my husband insists on reading just a little bit more he says things like i wish id read these as a child theyre fantastic  are they perfect no the last battle is a hard and frustrating read the magicians nephew is a little awkward the horse and his boy is just a tad controversial for some of its content but theyre so so worth the read  to me theres a magic to these books that time and life has never managed to dim terrific fantasy setting and storyline spoilt by extremely unsubtle allegory and as the story progresses excessive christian preachiness warning racial stereotypes abound and may offend  recommended for adults who thrive in a christian religious environment or those who can overlook these aspects totally and enjoy the story not for gullible children unless accompanied by a discerning adult  detailed review  i wont insult the intelligence of respected goodreaders by giving a synopsis of the narnia stories  i dont think there will be many here who do not know this story even if you have not actually read the books the stories of the four pevensie children who discover the magical land of narnia through the back of a wardrobe is the stuff of legend in literary circles  a land which they rule over as kings and queens after freeing it from the enchantment of the white witch under the benign yet firm supervision of aslan the lion  as fantasies for children go this is a terrific universe filled with possibilities there are talking animals magical creatures from greek mythology and english fairylore and suitably satisfying and mysterious landscape worthy of exploration again and again so one feels that if only the author in c s lewis had let himself go he could have produced something similar to the the lord of the rings  unfortunately he does not do that the author sublimates himself to the christian so that the story becomes allegory  and mostly allegory the spirit of gungho adventure is coated over with sicklysweet preachiness which becomes so cloying towards the end that one almost feels like throwing up read this as a kid and reread later on these  books were a great form of escapism despite the somewhat overbearing christian symbolism that is pervasive throughout the movies did not to the books justice but the animated film about lion witch and wardrobe was actually ok a must for kids overall i would give this book  stars below i have provided specific ratingsreviews for each story at first i was skeptical about reading the book in chronological order as opposed to publication order now that i look back at it it works well both ways i also had some trouble at first with the way the style of writing was presented but i got used to it pretty quickly the world of narnia is well written and detailed thanks to cs lewis i can safely say that i liked the introduction of every story but i just personally didnt find it to be extremely appealing as a whole this book nonetheless will be someone elses treasure not mine i liked it but i just wasnt too crazy about it  the magicians nephew  stars i would surely want to reread this story again in the near future such an original plot i enjoyed every minute of it getting to know the backstory and how narnia was created was interesting to me many people didnt like how there were connections with christianity but i found it to be quite creative there were a few metaphors between adam eve and the tree of wisdom digory and uncle andrew were my favorite characters even though at times the uncle seemed quite cynical my favorite moment would have to the fight at the lamp post and how they escaped one quote that stood out to me was what you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing it also depends on what sort of person you are  the lion witch and the wardrobe  stars i liked these characters they engaged me throughout the whole story my favorite character were the two youngest ones lucy and edmund they seemed to always have something going on with them there was also more human and animal interaction in this story than in the previous one but its interesting to read about again there are several religious metaphors present in this story too it was pleasurable reading and seeing all the symbolism we also get to see more of the magical world of narnia in this story so that is exciting i had fun with this story  the horse and his boy  stars this story started of interesting but i just wasnt so captivated by the  main characters the concept is good but it just isnt appealing to me the desert scene felt eternal to me and unexciting i did not hate it but i cant say i liked it it was ok compared to how great the previous two were this wasnt on that level  prince caspian  stars in this story we are introduced to prince caspian and i must say he was a well written character the backstory about him and finding out how he commences his journey is interesting i seem to enjoy the introductions of each story quite immensely this one being one of my favorites  the voyage of the dawn treader  stars my favorite part of this story was the involvement of the new character eustace even though he was portrayed negatively at first it was interesting viewing how he slowly changed the dragon scene was enjoyable to me i am not a big fan of all the other scenes they werent bad but just not mind blowing  the silver chair  stars the beginning of the novel was fun which is when eustace and jill embark on their new adventure they are sent on a mission and we read about their journey i found many parts dull this story didnt have much of an impact on me  the last battle  stars this story ends the series of the chronicles of narnia there were several parallels to heaven and at first these religious metaphors didnt bother me much in the previous strories but i just didnt like how they were used here it felt like one part of the novel dealt with adventure while the other part dealt with religiongodcreation themes i cant even begin to count how many times ive read the chronicles of narnia the truly amazing thing about these books is that each time you read them they magically become more complex more meaningful and more beautiful i first read the lion the witch and the wardrobe when i was about seven or eight years old and i did not get it at all sure i followed the story but the deeper meaning was completely lost on me someone later told me that it was a christian story and when i read the book again as a young teenager i picked up on that element of it in the many times ive read the books as an adult ive come to find that the underlying meaning  not just of the lion the witch and the wardrobe but of the other books as well  becomes gradually clearer until you cant believe you didnt see it all along the books are like narnia itself unfolding like an onion layer upon layer narnia upon narnia but each layer is bigger and better than the one above it  in order of the events that unfold in the story but not in the order that the books were published the chronicles of narnia include  the magicians nephew  the narnian creation story two children living in london are magically transported to other worlds and witness the dawn of narnia the story incorporates such familiar elements as a tree of knowledge and the fall of man  the lion the witch and the wardrobe  peter susan edmund and lucy four children living in england during world war ii stumble through a magic wardrobe and discover the land of narnia which has been ruled for hundreds of years by an evil white witch who has cast a spell over the land so that it is always winter but never christmas with the help of aslan the great lion they seek to free narnia this is the most obvious christian parable as aslan represents jesus and the story parallels the resurrection story  the horse and his boy  takes place during the golden age of narnia although most of the events unfold elsewhere in the southern lands of calormen and archenland shasta a calormene fishermans son runs away when he hears his father negotiating to sell him into slavery together with two talking horses and a noble calormene girl running away from an arranged marriage he tries to get to narnia the book is a meditation on faith and the concept that god helps those who help themselves its also my favorite of the seven books  prince caspian  peter susan edmund and lucy return to narnia to help young prince caspian recapture the throne of narnia from his evil uncle miraz not the most overtly religious of the stories  the voyage of the dawn treader  edmund lucy and their obnoxious cousin eustace join caspian now king of narnia on a quest to find seven banished lords who had served his father it doesnt seem all that religious until the end of the book which encourages people to seek god in their own lives  the silver chair  eustace whose personality has dramatically improved thanks to his time in narnia returns with his school friend jill to search for prince rilian caspians son who went missing ten narnian years earlier  the last battle  eustace and jill return again to narnia to assist king tirian the last king of narnia in his final stand the book is a parable of the end of days with chaos confusion war unbelief and the worship of false gods tirian eustace jill and their friends can only hope that aslan returns to narnia to deliver them  read them then read them again and again and again you wont be sorry the magicians nephew is easily the best story of the chronicles first of all its the least overtly religious there is a creationoftheworld element but its not our world so it seems more fantastic than religious not only is there a veil over the religiosity theres so much creativity in this story the magical rings the inbetween place the deplorable word the founding of narnia  starting with the lion the witch and the wardrobe the religiosity becomes noticeable with the witch as satan aslan as jesus and the emperor as god and because of the talking fighting animals the fantasy seems aimed at children i might have enjoyed it more at age   the next story in the series the horse and his boy takes a dark ethnocentric turn with its unfavorable depiction of the arablike calormen shoes turned up at the toe scimitars suffixed phrases of praise son of lineage declarations in the voyage of the dawn treader we get a notquitepositive summary of the calormen  they are a wise wealthy courteous cruel and ancient people they bowed most politely to caspian and paid him long complimentsbut of course what they wanted was the money they had paid  given that this book was published in  its possible to forgive the cultural insensitivity but its sad that children around the world still uncritically read such racist material  the voyage of the dawn treader demonstrates the problem with using god or jesus in a story there are no real conflicts when the dawn treader stops at dragon island the boy passenger eustace wanders off encounters a magical spell and is turned into a dragon this raises all kinds of serious issues about how to keep eustace the dragon with them but none of these problems matter because within  hours aslan just changes eustace back to a boy  there was a similar deus ex machina the term being used most appropriately in the lion the witch and the wardrobe to save edmunds soul aslan sacrifices his life but it wasnt aslans only life he had another one ready  one thing i found especially creative about the chronicles is how a story involving talking animals justifies eating animals the  film adaptation of the lion the witch and the wardrobe was what made me want to read this thick heavenly book little yet valiant lucy was very close to my heart as well as her siblings who occasionally thought she was crazy i was so enthralled by the movie and i asked my parents if they could buy me the series for my birthday  my uncle in the us was the one who granted my wish teehee after buying this collection from barnes  noble he immediately had it shipped all the way to the philippines hence this book literally traveled to my hands i was overwhelmed with happiness when it finally arrived after all it was the first series i had ever owned after caressing it for a long time i tucked myself into bed and got down to business  little did i know that this would be the series that would transform me into a devoted booknerd at the age of  i managed to fly through each novel because they were just so beautiful and fantastic the perfect mix of magic adventure and biblical allusions captivated me from start to finish by the time i read the last battle i was already a hardcore fanboy  in totality the chronicles of narnia will always have a special place in my heart and library just looking at aslans face on the cover fills me with much happiness and nostalgia if i were the ruler of books i would require everyone in the planet to read this timeless series one of my favorite series growing up very formative to me as it combined a love of fantasy with my religious upbringing wanted to check out its affects on me since im not christian anymore  the chronicles of narnia strikes me now as a unique series its probably base on a oldschool chronicles format i do not recognize because my lack of college education not only does cs lewis push christian ideology over commercial appeal which oddly enough lead to lasting commercial success but he has a rotating cast of human characters from our world in the four pevensie children their cousin eustace his friend jill pole uncle digory and his friend polly plummer along with many narnian native like prince caspian the white witch reepicheep and my favorite puddleglum the only constant character in the book is aslan the lion the narnian world is also very well developed probably a side affect of lewis being friend with jrr tolkien lewis takes you to other kingdoms across the eastern sea and to the underworld also spans the whole expanse of time in narnia from creation to destruction which is a really neat concept for a series theres so much good in here magic honor valor and friendship lots of lessons taught in this series great for kids and adults alike a lot to like here and the christian symbolism is only overt in certain book i never found it to be distracting but can see how others would this series hit some nostalgia points but i am surprised how much i did not remember the sixth book in particular the silver chair i did not remember at all  recommend to everyone young and old christian or not fantasy or non fiction reader i have encountered few people who did not at least like the lion witch and the wardrobe so if your interested in literary history or good worldbuilding enter the granddaddy of portal fantasy the chronicles of narnia  this read could not be described any better than this  journeys to the end of the world fantastic creatures and epic battles between good and evilwhat more could any reader ask for in one book the book that has it all is the lion the witch and the wardrobe written in  by clive staples lewis but lewis did not stop there six more books followed and together they became known as the chronicles of narnia i love how you can see aslan as jesus giving up his life for us and the greater power or deaper magic that brings him back to life back in the early s i encountered this wonderful series through the first of the books to be written the lion the witch and the wardrobe below i quote most of my review of that book insofar as it applies to the whole series i subsequently discovered the whole series and in the s read it to my wife who loved it as much as i do we didnt read it in this omnibus edition but as individual books and for a long time i intended to eventually review each book separately but since the series has so much commonality i decided that reviewing it as a single entity is more practical  note this omnibus volume lists the seven books of the series in their internal chronological order starting with the magicians nephew which describes aslans creation of narnia and this is the order in which lewis himself recommended that they be read barb and i however read and experienced the series in the order in which the books were written lewis fans debate which order is preferable and i can see both sides of that usually my preference is to read a series in internal chronological order but the way that we read this one probably provides for more of a feeling of resonance in the later ones as certain things that were mysterious before fall into place later  most people know that c s lewis was an effective christian nonfiction apologist using the tools of reason and logic to build the philosophical case for christian faith but he ultimately became convinced that an even more effective apologetic is available through the truth of art the instinctive and emotional appeal that stories exert  especially the kinds of stories that draw on the deep mythical archetypes of fantasy to illuminate the real universe the chronicles of narnia his classic fantasy series was the fruit of that discovery set in narnia a magical land whose world lies in another universe in which magic works and time moves differently than it does here and in which christ is incarnate as the great talking lion aslan the first book of the series presents one of the most powerful symbolic literary presentations of the christian gospel ever written although the intended audience in lewis mind was children and his various direct addresses to the readers as author presuppose this there is nothing invidiously juvenile about the quality of the writing it can be enthusiastically appreciated by anyone who loves tales of imagination and adventure fantasy and wonder and the truths here like those in jesus parables are simple enough to speak to children but profound enough to challenge adults  the christian message is an essential part of all of the books in the narnia series we all react to fiction based partly on how we feel about the messages it conveys and thats appropriate so readers whose view of christianity or of religion in general is highly negative could hardly be expected to give the narnia series unqualified praise the converse applies of course to books like the his dark materials series by philip pullman who avowedly seeks to be the antilewis it isnt surprising that his work is less appreciated by readers who hold a very negative view of militant atheism thats a subjective assessment and fair enough as such some other criticisms of lewis series though are intended to be more objective and can be debated objectively this discussion might contain some spoilers  one reviewer states that the series has no real conflicts because aslan can exercise miraculous power to resolve them but if this is so then the theistic view of real life is that it has no real conflicts either since god has miraculous power to resolve them but no theists that im aware of view real life in that way least of all lewis as his other writings indicate and insights from all of his writings are valuable in interpreting the narnia books since his thought was highly unified as his writings on miracles make clear he believed that god can intervene in the natural order miraculously but doesnt do so very often because intervening on a wholesale basis would negate the predictability of natural law and leave us unable to recognize a miracle when one did happen and very importantly god doesnt make peoples choices for them they exercise free will which requires that their choices have meaningful consequences good or bad so in narnia as in the real world aslan doesnt intervene very often and most readers observe quite a bit of conflict bad things happen and they arent always deserved evil isnt automatically and instantly punished and good characters suffer and inevitably die some well before their time and characters experience a good deal of conflict in struggling to decide on the right course of action or on whether or not to do what they think is right when all the rewards would appear to gained by doing wrong in one of the books eustace is indeed changed back from dragon to boy but only after he learns a lesson about the value of human friendship and that doesnt come easily to him and in the first book yes aslan will be resurrected after giving his life for edmund but his death is still an awful experience that he undergoes for someone whose welfare viewed from a coldly objective standpoint is nothing to him most of us wouldnt undergo it even with the guarantee of resurrection  like most nonvegetarians lewis views eating of meat as appropriate when the meat is that of a non rational nonthinking creature eating a being who can speak is cannibalism no matter what that being looks like whether or not one regards that as a significant distinction or how significant its seen as being is a matter of opinion but it is a genuine distinction between humans and for instance cattle  probably the most significant criticism here is the accusation of ethnocentrism and racism in the portrayal of the calormen calormen are darker in color than narnians their culture differs from the narnian one and their government is a despotic empire that would like to add narnia to its domains neither narnian nor calormen culture are identical with any culture in our world though like all fantasy writers lewis uses this worlds cultures as a grabbag from which he can pull various features calormen is mostly desert but its polity is much more turkish than arablike and the idolatrous cult of tash doesnt resemble islam some readers assume that any mention of dark skin means that the people so depicted have to be racially inferior that race and culture are the same thing with the former dictating the features of the latter and that the character of a government mirrors the character of a people and that if narnia and calormens governments tend to be hostile and suspicious toward each other that must mean that everything narnian is good and everything calormen is evil but there are good reasons to think that lewis didnt share these assumptions nor want to convey them  two of the most sympathetic and positively treated characters in the series are the calormenes aravis and emeth aravis is a strong gutsy and capable heroine she winds up marrying prince cor and their son grows up to be archenlands greatest king and emeth whose name not coincidentally is the word for truth in hebrew is readily welcomed by aslan into heaven having amply demonstrated his moral worth this certainly suggests that lewis judges and wants his readers to judge calormenes not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character its also instructive that a character in that hideous strength lord feverstone advocates liquidation of the backward races but hes a spokesman for the anythingbutnice nice whose social program represents everything lewis detested  in the latter novel closer to the end lewis lays out a theory of human cultures in which all of them at their best and truest are unique and distinct embodiments of moral and social truth making a kind of truly multicultural mosaic in which the differences are respected and appreciated this idea is reflected in the last battle where aslans true country is made up of the platonic ideal of every created country including calormen where lucy sees the towers of the true tashbaan so calormens cultural differences from narnia can be viewed in this light there is no reason to think lewis view of shoes turned up at the toe scimitars suffixed phrases of praise sonof lineage declarations was unfavorable the latter are found in the bible a book lewis certainly viewed favorably and some of his writings suggest that he rather liked stately formal courtesy in social interactions he contrasts the calormen oral storytelling tradition favorably with english teaching practices and if calormen culture is called cruel in one place which lewis would say is a deformation caused by sin its also called wise finally king miraz and his gang who are all white arent viewed as any more benevolent than the calormen tisroc and his toadies the actions of both are due not to race and nationality but to the common experience of human fallenness  this is far and away one of my favorite fantasy series id highly recommend it for any readers who appreciate imaginative literature and i believe most would find it both intensely entertaining and thoughtprovoking a mostly wellwritten very imaginative thoroughly enjoyable read the narration is warm and witty the protagonists are well developed and likable but not perfect written perfectly but with flaws that give the stories depth and the settings are vivid and fantastic remember those loony onefooted invisible things that hop around and the ending when the boat sails over that undersea city and then into the clouds at the edge of the world  im always annoyed when people confound the quality of this series as literature with the quality of the worldview it allegedly expounds as if the literary world is some kind of neostalinist monolith where the only legitimate art is that which edifies us by propounding a correct ethical system its just a story and a good one at that furthermore as an atheist i think  the religious content of the novels is overstated and  even if it isnt oh fucking well that doesnt detract from the novels one whit the books really dont have any more to do with christianity in particular than does any other story with a character who gives up his life to save others see harry potter  see also religious archetypes in general  as for the calormen i think its highly possible that the garb was just supposed to convey the exotic and this particular nation just happens to be bad in the world of the book everything is not a political statement the good faun from lww is not a statement about how pagan nature religions are good likewise i just dont see that the bad calormen are necessarily a statement about how the people who once wore curlytoed shoes in the real world are bad  in sum its a good story and even if all the criticisms of the book its racist its christian etc are true its still a good story and if all i ever read were wholesome books explicitly conveying a wonderful worldview i would be bored as hell i read the entire series one right after another eight times in a row when i got them for christmas in fourth grade obviously i loved them then just finished reading them again to eric my yearold and loved them maybe jus
Lord of the Flies,kids are evil dont you know  ive just finished rereading this book for my book club but to be honest ive liked it ever since my class were made to read it in high school overall lord of the flies doesnt seem to be very popular but ive always liked the almost hobbesian look at the state of nature and how humanity behaves when left alone without societal rules and structures make the characters all angelfaced kids with sadistic sides to their personality and what do you have just your average high school drama but set on a desert island with a bit more bloody murder but not that much more  in  when this book was published britain was in the process of being forced to face some harsh realities that it had blissfully chosen to ignore beforehand  that it is not in fact the centre of the universe and the british empire was not a thing of national pride but an embarrassing infringement on the freedom and rights of other human beings much of british colonialism had been justified as a selfrighteous mission to educate and modernise foreign savages so when put into its historical context alongside the decolonisation movements this book could be said to be an interesting deconstruction of white western supremacy  of course to a modern reader theres a lot of racism in this book the racial aspect is a big factor golding establishes from the very first page that ralph is a perfect white blondehaired blueeyed private school boy and piggy even asks which is better  to be a pack of painted ns like you are or to be sensible like ralph is im not going to argue with anyones interpretation but i think there is actually room to see this book as a criticism of racism for me i always saw it as golding challenging the notion of savages being darkskinned uneducated people from rural areas with this book he says screw that ill show you savages and proceeds to show us how these private school silver spoon little jewels of the empire are no better for their fancy education and goldplated upbringing  i think that seemed especially clear from the ending when the officer says i should have thought that a pack of british boys  youre all british arent you  would have been able to put up a better show than that goldings way of saying that human nature is universal and no one can escape it  some readers say that you have to have quite a negative view of human nature already to appreciate this book but i dont think thats true im not sure i necessarily agree with all the implications running around in the novel  namely the failure of democracy and the proauthority stance  but it serves as an interesting look at the dark side of human nature and how no one is beyond its reach plus anyone who had a bit of a rough time in high school will probably not find the events in this book a huge leap of the imagination  the fascinating thing about lord of the flies is the way many historical parallels can be drawn from the messages it carries you could choose to view the charismatic and manipulative jack merridew as a kind of hitler or other dictator who takes advantage of a group of people at their weakest dictators and radicals often find it easy to slip in when a society is in chaos we do not have to assume that golding believed that everyone everywhere is evil only that we all have the capacity for it when we find ourselves in unstable situations  still a fascinating book after all these years i read this book a long time ago long enough to where i barely remembered anything past the basic premise so i picked it up again only to wish i hadnt theres a reason why they teach this book in middle schoolin order to enjoy this book ones intellectual cognizance must be that of a child because otherwise youll spend the entire time picking out everything thats wrong with the book and theres a lot to pick out  from what little of the story that is actually coherent i can see why this book has had a lasting effect on social commentary since its initial publishing the overlying illustration of how easily man can devolve back to his feral instincts is striking yet could have been infinitesimally more effective in the hands of a decent writer  see i would have cared a bit more about the little island society of prepubescent boys and their descent into barbarism if you know any of the characters had been developed at all instead were thrown interchangeable names of interchangeable boys who are only developed enough to conform to the basic archetypes golding requires to hobble his little story along the leader the rebel the fatkid the nosepicker etc were he born in this time i believe golding would have done brilliantly as a scriptwriter for reality tv  and the plot theres a plot im guessing so since things seem to happen but its kind of hard to tell since he spends pages describing irrelevant events that are never incorporated characters that possibly exist yet probably dont and using words that dont mean what he thinks they mean and as the main characters are a bunch of kids not worth caring about thus goes the way of the story  and the prose dear god the prose get it away it burns us  so yeah this book sucked it had potential there were even a few parts i internally squealed at in hopeful anticipation but whatever potential it did have was hopelessly squandered by a man who wrote like hed never written anything before in his life dont waste your time a group of boys are stranded on a remote and deserted island how will these boys fare away from grownups away from society away from rules  written in  the lord of the flies written by william golding is considered a classic the symbolism in this book is unreal especially if you consider the colors mentioned in the book pink was mentioned  times like most people i read this in high school and i got a lot more out of it as an adult at the very end i now ponder if that actually happened or if ralph was just imagining it trying to avoid any spoilers here the author who is deceased now has stated that the book can mean whatever you want it to mean so clearly everything in this review is absolutely true if you want to check out more of my thoughts and questions raised for this book please check out the readalong thank you to everyone who participated and made this reading so much better than my first  although this book goes down as a classic it is rather bleakthere is very little hope or anything that can be considered uplifting there were too many boring descriptions of the scar more than  times and sand more than  times as for the audiobook through audible william golding the author is reading the book he sounds extremely bored i do not recommend the audible version  overall i wish that i hadnt read this as a child it traumatized me and i wasnt ready for it there is too much violence and ill will in this every time i would pick up a book i would think about piggy and feel darkness however as an adult perhaps i was more prepared knowing the ending but i also developed the sophistication to appreciation the subtleties of this book for me this quote sums up the entire book its a powerful exploration of humanity and the wrongness of our society and it also demonstrates the hypocrisy of war adults judge the behaviour of children but are they really any better i think not  the scary thing about this book is how real it is the lord of the flies bespeaks the brilliance of realistic dystopian fiction it gives you a possible world scenario a bunch of very human characters and then it shows you want might happen when they are thrown into a terrible situation they act like monsters or humans what golding shows us is that we are not so far from our primal nature from our so called killer instincts and all it takes is a little push out of the standard world we live in for us to embrace our darker side  the boys act in accordance with what they have seen in the world though they dont understand limits power creates authority and violence is a way to achieve the peace you want sort of ironic isnt it they go to war amongst themselves and in doing so lose all sense of childhood innocence they grow up they learn what humans are capable of doing when pushed they become savages and reject civilisation and create their own sense of community though in another display of irony this in itself becomes a minicivilisation just a one of their own accord without any rules and a nasty child tyrant enthroned as chief  what are we humans or animals or savages  the novel is rich in allegory to the point where it has been interpreted in so many different ways over the years like all great literature it could mean lots of things and nothing at all its a very clever piece of writing and it got me thinking a great deal about children and how we protect them from the realities of the world it sort of says something to me a quiet acknowledgement about how messed up things can be given the right circumstances and these children are so very quick to embrace it with unflinching enthusiasm at least when one of them leads the way  its a good book with a lot of ideas though at times i found the prose a little hard to follow the dialogue is confusing at times and many of the children fade into the background with only a small few developing distinct personalities i found the first part of the story particularly difficult to read so in terms of the actual execution i think it could have been done a little better i found myself wanting to edit sections of the text which is not a place a reader should ever be in especially with a novel this revered by so many enthusiastic readers critics and students maybe im just a little picky with word placement  overall though im glad i spent the time to revisit it there are so many popculture references to this that a reminder was needed lord of the flies is one of the most disturbing books ive ever read it was required high school reading and since then ive read it four more times it is as disturbing now as it was then using a group of innocent schoolboys stranded on an island the author very realistically portrays human behavior in an environment where civilization no longer has meaning  maybe he said hesitantly maybe there is a beast what i mean is    maybe its only us  that quote sums up very well the idea of this modern classic i ran away from this novel for years but it finally caught up with me or i tripped who knows it was a lot more interesting than i expected and it was worth my time but i would not say i loved it  during some sort of war a plane crashes on an island and the only survivors are a bunch of kids forced to stay alive without the guidance and surveillance of adults some start to behave crazy and cruel i guess the morale is that people are civilized because there are rules that are reinforced and if the society gets rid of them some of use will return to our animal state or worse  while i admit that the story is thoughtprovoking and a classic a pioneer of the subject i cannot say i enjoyed reading it too much not much happens for most of the book and when it does it feels rushed also the author spent a lot more time describing the nature than the characters or their experience i had problems distinguishing between the children and i did not manage to form a strong opinion either about the positive characters or the negative ones finally i think it did not age well it is hard to explain why i have this impression  i both listened to and read lord of the flies while listening i got lost in the descriptions read bored so i thought the written version was more suitable for this story i hated this book first off as i remember it talks about humans failure to govern ourselves or more broadly the failures of human nature there are a few reasons why i think simply dropping a group of kids on a desert island does not in fact prove anything   these kids were raised in a capitalist nominally demcratic society the first thing they do is appoint leaders as someone who spends my time working in consensus based groups seeking to challenge hierarchical structures i have a strong belief that this is not how things need to be it takes a bunch of unlearning and relearning to use these formats  simply being in a new space or being a child does not do this work the author and the children he writes about are a part of a specific culture and its incorrect to generalize these values to a broader concept of human nature   theyre all boys again socialization yes even of a  year old plays a huge role in what behavior we see as appropriate while its quite true that men or at least masculinity control government its ridiculous to use only boys to extrapolate what ways of governing ourselves are possible  i read this book in  when i was a freshman in highschool so maybe theres something i missed or maybe my memories are being colored by just how gross the pigs head descriptions were if so feel free to correct me for now though i have to say that this book is offensive and makes dangerous assumption a hard book to rate as although its well written and is very thought provoking the content gets unpleasantly graphic and some aspects are awkwardly dated eg the assumption the british boys should be jolly good chaps  were not savages were english  plot  it starts off as a conventional adventure a mixed group of boys some know each other many who dont survive a plane crash on a desert island and struggle to survive it is somewhat confused and confusing at first  perhaps to make the reader empathise with the boys confusion  from the outset there are issues of priorities jacks instant gratification of hunting or ralphs long term need for shelter and maintaining a fire signal and leadership its inevitable that standards of civilization will slip  there is also an infectious fear of the beast although whether one interprets it as animal airman hallucination or symbolic may vary at different points in the story certainly the tone of the book changes after simons first encounter with lord of the flies   image teaching lord of the flies by the jenkins comic source   group dynamics  eventually the boys split into two groups hunters who become ever more savage in appearance and behaviour and the remainder who want to retain order safety common sense  and their lives why do the obedient and angelic choir turn to savagery  does the fact they have an identified leader who isnt the overall leader once theyre on the island contribute one also wonders how the story might be different if it was a mixed sex group or even an all girl group very different certainly and i suppose it would provide a distraction to what golding was trying to say about human or just male nature  it illustrates how petty bullying can be condoned and encouraged within groups exacerbated by rituals chanting body markings etc and how it can escalate to much worse nevertheless one of the main victims piggy is proud of his differences demonstrates knowledge and intelligence and actually grows in confidence as his leader loses his  milgran zimbardo christianity  it questions whether it is power or the environment that makes some of the boys so bad echoes of zimbardos prison experiments and milgrams obedience experiments  if a book can echo things which came after it was written  in fact golding experimented while a teacher at a public school with setting boys against one another in the manner of lord of the flies see here thanks matt  the more christian concept of original sin runs through it which was probably goldings intention his editor made him make simon less jesuslike along with other christian analogies relating to snakes devils aka lord of the flies self sacrifice and redemptionrescue  and then there are the conch and fire as symbols of order and god respectively in total contrast to the warpaint etc of the warriors  lots to think about but more the stuff of nightmares than dreams  compared with the hunger games  its interesting to compare this with the hunger games which modern teens probably find much easier to relate to see my review here i think one problem lord of the flies has is that the period is tricky too far from the present to seem relevant though i think it is but not long enough ago to be properly historical  compared with i have no mouth and i must scream  for another dysfunctional group trying to survive a very different ordeal see harlan ellisons horrific short story about an evil supercomputer which i reviewed here without what the author intended to do or probably has done it would be a  star but so  star is the only option  of course its completely natural to become primitive again within the shortest amounts of time and not an unintended dark comedy self satirizing biased sexual predator of an author who finally deus ex machinas out of this mess  in a private journal and in a memoir for his wife golding said he tried to rape a yearold girl when he was  and on his first holiday from oxford   he had met her when both were taking music lessons in marlborough wiltshire when he was about  and she was  but he tried to rape her two years later when he was home during his first year at oxford golding writes that they went for a walk to the common and he felt sure she wanted heavy sex as this was visibly written on her pert ripe and desirable mouth soon they were wrestling like enemies as he tried unhandily to rape her she resisted and golding years later wrote that he had made such a bad hand at rape before shaking her and shouting im not going to hurt you a later girlfriend mollie was also treated badly by golding she was another local from marlborough whom he later let down by breaking off their engagement because he had found her frigid   the attempted rape involved a marlborough girl named dora who had taken piano lessons with golding it happened when he was  and on holiday during his first year at oxford carey quotes the memoir as partially excusing the attempted rape on the grounds that dora was depraved by nature and at  was already sexy as an ape it reveals that golding told his wife he had been sure the girl wanted heavy sex she fought him off and ran away as he stood there shouting im not going to hurt you the memoir said   golding who won the nobel prize in  three years after bagging the booker for rites of passage admitted trying to rape a yearold schoolgirl when he was an yearold student at oxford according to a forthcoming biography by john carey the schoolgirl put up a fierce resistance but they had sex two years later according to golding who nevertheless called her depraved by nature and sexy as an ape in his unpublished memoir men women  now he wrote it for ann his wife of  years to explain his monstrous character     fringe philosophy downgrading and unintended satirizing of kids language from an adults perspective to seem capable of writing empathic and emotional tragiccomic dialogues and characters is a cheap trick that fails epically if not performed right but its the logical consequence of making kids act as if they were stupid animals to integrate a biased boring and one sided plot if you want real philosophy on an island read   more bad philosophy on an island read  this one has everything racism glorifying religious extremism a true clear picture of our past  back to the show as its often the problem with monopolies the ones in art lead to overrated hyped and simply not good wanna be philosophical constructions i mean symbolic metaphysical allegory metaphor overload for young people who want to be entertained honestly dont try to murder each other kids what a lesson of course kids are so stupid that they immediately establish cultic dictatorships if they are not supervised what else should logically happen  if this wouldnt be a typical forced read to torture school kids and a kind of pre pop psychology nobel prize higher literature with meaning drivel i would say its barely average but because of its excessive misuse its just unacceptable possibly the ever so clever bureaucrats of the boards of education all over the world ought think a second about removing all the trash of all the lauded boring outdated obsolete literature each country tends to accumulate in a strange mixture of patriotism cultural imperialism our writers literature tradition and think about including the great amazing wonderful worlds of literature kids and young adults want to read  the worst classic ive ever read one extra star up to  could have been given for incompetently trying to be deep philosophical and critical and failing to transport the important message about the evil lurking in naked apes nice try william but just an epic fail and total bigotry regarding your alcohol and abuse problems you loved to drivel about in your strange diaries of a molester i was really searching for deeper meaning any of all the arguments seen in positive reviews but its just unrealistic the ending is a bad joke putting as much symbolism and innuendos in it to camouflage the immense flaws doesnt really help and it just fuels my opinion that just as in real life much of what is idealized and glorified is just bad and rotten look at the ratings of goldings other books rated by people who like to read classics another achievement in inability  i know there are many getting real pleasure out of classic literature thats a question of taste and i dont force them to read my trivial literature thats where the tolerance ends because the problem is that the previously mentioned kids teens and young adults dont deserve to be bored with what elder generations may really enjoy but has absolutely no worth for them i did once make the mistake of reading a few dozen classics and most were just average some really bad but definitively close to none great its sad avoidable and just plain anachronistic to violently keep extremely outdated versions of descriptions of long away pasts in the curriculum and the main reason kids and teens hate to read  irony time there would be old classic clever books that could really tell something about human nature not using placative over the top violence especially in the classic and new scifi and socialscifi genre that explore many questions regarding human nature state politics sexuality economics faith but they would be too extreme progressive and subtle cause bigoted conservatives dont want their kids to read really dangerous meta context social criticism stuff they want some characters far away from any real imminent problems playing hide and seek with a freaking pigs head  it truly left me speechless just asking why whats wrong with you humanities literary critique nobel prize quality literature higher art snobs modern art dont you realize that you are satirizing yourself by praising so many works that many avid lifelong readers with k reading scores deem bad arrogant boring and worthless reminiscences of a past when bigoted unenlightened people celebrated any trash that could distract from their incredible cognitive biases it at least also lets me imagine a purgatory library filled with this stuff and dark angels forcing me to read it until i become insane repair my brain and restart the process forever mwahahaha  trying to find an explanation a combination of personal drivel with the biography of a disturbed mind the author had issues binge drinking and alcoholism were demons haunting him and he did exactly write this one thing that made him famous and nothing else of importance what makes one more disgusted is the fact that he as mentioned tried to rape a  year old girl when he was  how often has he been successful and didnt write about it because he was so completely wasted and drunk that he wouldnt even remember it a reason he should at least be retrospectively condemned as retroactive time travel castration isnt really an option thats one of the crime areas where i distance myself from restorative justice and go full metal eye for an eye archaic retributive justice because i am of the opinion that sex offenders should be incarcerated under terrible conditions life imprisonment without any chance to ever see the light of the day again and this rehabilitation thing is complete psychologic psychiatric  other partly fringe science the humanities unleashed on humanity like a plague nonsense nobody would try to cure someone who is heterosexual homosexual or has a different gender identity than physical body because thats completely crazy but hey someone who is born seen in babies or made a pedophile rapist necrophile etc can of course be healed and another very important factor its cheaper for the state to release serial sex killers to save some money and wait if it takes them weeks or months until the next victim is tortured raped and eaten how is it possible that psychiatrists say that they are no danger anymore before and dont get any problems for their little oopsies however such a tortured poor soul someone who raped as bad as he wrote could become a celebrated highlight of highbrow s literature which makes him worthy of even more fringe nobel prizes maybe for voodoo economics  i just dont buy it  this book is famous for unmasking what brutes we are just under the surface but well for all the hype it just isnt convincing peopleeven teenage boysjust arent as savage as golding seems to want us to believe and nothing in this book persuades me otherwise  perhaps if id gone to english boarding school id feel differentlybut then thats the real irony of this book that the brutality from which the british empire was supposed to save so many people and cultures was in fact the brits projecting their own savagery onto others  but the rest of us no we arent monsters underneath a little messed up maybe a little more raw but nowhere near the kind of brutes that golding wants us to believe i absolutely hated this book thats my overriding memory of it im afraid i had to read it in secondary school when i was about  and i never remember disliking a book so much which was surprising as i was a voracious reader  i just remember having absolutely nothing in common with the characters  a group of english upper  middle class school boys whereas i was a scottish working class girl i just could not relate to the story at all and just wished they would all kill each other as soon as possible so the book would finish  the fact that we had to read the book in class at the pace of some of the slower readers agonisingly painfully slow readers and then discuss it afterwards which was like trying to get blood out of a stone probably didnt help  never ever again im glad i can check this one off my list i wish i had enjoyed it more i was pretty bored after chapter two so i started to read online articles and other reviews to find out the author confessed that he attempted to rape a girl named nora  when he was  while home from his first year at oxford made my skin crawl he was sure the girl wanted heavy sex there are plenty of articles online with a simple search william goldingrape nobel prize for literature novelist yea whatever  another golding confession was when he was a teacher he got schoolboys to fight among themselves maybe thats the origin of lord of the flies  the audiobook on libbyoverdrive read by the author was dreadful i searched and found much superior narration on youtube by martin jarvis a disturbing story more so because they were kids what a pleasant story  i didnt exactly want to read about a bunch of preteen boys killing animals and acting like idiots but theres a thing called required reading sigh  this is a favorite book of english teachers everywhere probably because it has a theme and so much symbolism look all i want is an exciting plot decent writing and characters with i dont know personalities apparently the bar was too high   the plot  a bunch of boys are stranded on an island with no way of contacting the outside world as expected they go a little crazy i would have liked this but it wasnt creepy or disturbing at all the characters just stumbled through their little island occasionally killing their friends all with no outstanding emotions or reactions to their situation  the book begins with piggy and ralph and their realization that no adults survived the crash rather than rejoice in their freedom or even mourn the grownups they simply stand there like two bumps on a log when jacks tribe kills one of their own they have no reaction they talk to each other for a bit about how horrible they are and then thats it  its so dull too they hunt a pig ralph talks about a fire they eat they argue over the stupidest things possible ralph talks about a fire someone dies ralph is still mumbling something about a fire   the characters  besides being devoid of all emotion theyre basically just vessels through which golding tells his story this isnt wrong exactly but it turns quickly into indifference when the story itself isnt enough to hold my interest each boy is a caricature a symbol representing a theme its not at all difficult to pull out these themes either  piggy the fat one is the voice of reasona conscience if you will ralph the leader is the law and order of the island who symbolizes societal expectations jack the powerhungry jerk represents our inner demons and violent urges   thats like saying sofia the loud one who represents the relentless noise of society with loud being my only characteristic   the writing  i havent read anything worse in actually i read a book with equally terrible writing yesterday ages the dialogue is absolute trash its basically this over and over again  dyou think no i dunno on account of my asthma you see your auntie i saw the beast  no one is capable of forming a full sentence apparently these boys only retained a fraction of their brains when they fell out of the plane  heres a sample of the description which is hardly coherent and makes absolutely no sense more does not equal better random words put together does not equal good imagery  if you could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the return if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts on either side then there was a chance that you might put the beast out of mind and dream for a while   and thats one of the better passages all in all it was inflated way too much when something much simpler would have done the job    a classic i guess so a good book nah interesting story for me it doesnt hold up by current day tastes its definitely a parable or allegory of social mores how man once left without social structure degenerates to base instincts i liked it well enough but would have preferred more details in order for it to work there was a plane crash where was the wreckage it describe the path cut in the jungle but doesnt describe the wreckage or how the children survived skipped right over that part the kids just appear on the beach the author i think was too en rapt with the symbolism and theme rather than telling the story for example everyone eats fruit but there is never a description of the fruit or how they eat it what it tastes like the author flies over all these sort of details and focuses on proving his theme david putnam author of the bruno johnson series yup i have now ticked box where it says this book is one of the must read classics and i think thats the highlight of my reading experience that i have with this story  there are many things that are hard to believe about this story like why only teenagers got stranded on the island other than few no one said anything about going home violence among these kids is not such a big thing as this is a common occurrence nowadays this book depicts how easily humans could turn violent and their desire to rule fellow humans but i was also expecting another trait of human nature to come out and that was being stand united against oppression sadly that did not happen  definitely a disturbing read but not an outstanding story in todays world thank god im done with this horrible book  a plane full of british schoolboys crash lands on a deserted island with no adults in the beginning they try to be civilized and concentrate on being rescued but the mind of jack quickly too quickly id say becomes twisted and warped into madness the main protagonist is ralph the one who remained slightly sane throughout the book ralph was really annoying at the start but he grew as a character farther into the story i hated jack from the very start he was a fucking terrible person treating piggy like dirt piggy was my favorite character along with simon and guess who dies both of the them and for some reason jack doesnt      i didnt think this story was realistic at all i doubt a boy or a group of bo
Romeo and Juliet,as i looked over my previously read books and searched for one that was missing a review romeo and juliet stood out to me but then i thought about it who doesnt know about this play who hasnt read it in school sometime in the past who hasnt watched a movie version or seen some sort of take on the classic tortured romance story and why on earth would anyone care to read another review let alone my review on it exactly so dont look for much here as im sure most everyone has read it already and im not that funny to even make reading my opinions worth it that said a few shared thoughts about what ive learned from this play     parents exist to torture their children its a simple fact if your child wants x it is your responsibility to keep x away from himher     love will always end in disaster dont attempt it without proper backup     even though someone looks dead they probably arent kill them again just to be sure     your bros or girls dont always have your back     magic powders are the cure for everything always trust what you dont understand and just inhale it like the world is about to end    in all sincerity i do like the play a lot ive enjoyed countless interpretations i think parts of it are brilliant and parts of it are pure illogical nonsense every tv show and movie has their own reappropriation to tell not everything can be perfect when it comes to love but this play certainly teaches a lot of lessons and provides a lot of bumps and this reader still goes along for the ride so youre at a nice outdoor cafe one day eating your lunch and all of a sudden some fool kids come running through the square with their swords out apparently theyve got some strong second amendment advocates in verona and insist on skewering each other right there in front of you in the square and seriously all you want to do is just eat your damn fine not that anyone asked you pasta and get back to work before your lord finds some excuse to fire you but nooooo instead youve gotta deal with a whole lot of screaming panicky dangerous crowds rubbernecking around and betting on these rich kids fighting over who knows or cares what and theres no way youre gonna get back in time  yeah thats about the read i got from shakespeare on this play this is an excellent deconstruction of the elements that make up major greek tragedies breaking it down into parts and fitting them into modern day or it was then society shakespeare was a great adapter of older tales retold to suit his own purposes and here it shows  so theres this greek story right its set up on this grand scale with major crashing chords that are played over and over throughout the tale theres the greek chorus of course at the beginning and then somewhere in the middle to remind us what it is were watching theres a good deal of sky imagery to go along with this invoking of the old gods moons suns clouds night stars dreams even the otherworldly faejuliet is the sun the lark the herald of the dawn take him and cut him into little stars the queen mab speech tons of other examples by the same token the gods of the underworld are equally called to witness lots of death grave earth imagery as well examples too many to count these extreme terms are then often juxtaposed next to each other wedding bedgrave is probably the most frequently used for obvious reasons throughout the course of the tale  through this shakespeare shows you just how seriously his main characters take everything thats going on especially romeo and juliet of course but also all the other family members of the capulets and montagues with the exception of mercutio everything is on a grand scale everything is the most important thing ever nothing could be more lofty  until shakespeare quite strongly states his opposition to that idea  he thrusts this grand tragedy into the midst of a bustling thriving city where the participants must brush elbows with and be interrupted by the every day facts of life he uses each stupid mistake to show us all the ways the end we know is coming could have been and should have been averted were it not for the stupidest thing that could possibly happen happening in every single scenario i ended up thinking this after seeing all those scenes of servants at the capulet house preparing for parties servants running about the city with messages escorting nurse on her errands inserting a plague that prevented the letter from getting to romeo while the two teenage idiots are upstairs enacting this farce life is happening all around them and they are just way way too selfcentered to see it juliet is a bit more aware than romeo though she understands the conflict between the two families what it will likely mean for them what she needs to do to get what she wants and how to accomplish it and yet even she is so centered on the fulfillment of what she wants she can barely pause to think of others theres a great little moment when nurse comes back from seeing romeo in the square and juliet is really impatient to hear what he had to say nurse is all im old im out of breath give me a second juliet doesnt seem to really care if she dies on the spot so long as she gets the information she wants and then nurse says accidentally the words that i think explain this whole play  your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and i warrant a virtuouswhere is your mother  exactly shes thirteen you guys thats exactly what he should have said when he met her and didnt you know why cause romeos a virgin who really really would prefer not to be he tells the friar that he likes juliet instead of rosalind now because she loves him back and will presumably have sex with him whereas rosalind would not friars great response o she rosalind knew wellthy love did read by rote and could not spell  just another case of why true love waits is a poor plan if only romeo had himself a girlfriend this whole thing could have been avoided  this play displays the soul of adolescence both positive and negative negative seems to be more promiently on display at first the characters are selfcentered impatient convinced that if what they want doesnt come true the way they want it to the whole world will end theres also another big adolescent theme masks teenagers spend a lot of time trying to figure out what face they want to wear to the world what they want to present themselves as so it makes sense that theres tons of masks hiding lots of hiding and subterfuge going on here  whats interesting to me though is that it also shows the other side of adolescence the part thats thinking about growing up but cant quite leave behind his childish things one major example of this to me the influence of several characters on romeo mercutio and the friar even benvolio it seems to me that theyre starting to get through to the guy in the short time hes there especially mercutio he gets him to go to the party gets him to laugh and joke again and manages to give him some fine counsel into the bargain i witnessed a lot of echoes of mercutio coming out in romeo they just dont seem to quite take hold for instance theres mercutios magnificent queen mab speech which he follows up with true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind  ie dont take all these heart burnings so seriously kid romeo does appear to consider this later though he does dismiss it similarly the friars long speech about manhood ie his great smackdown of how why romeo is terrible seems to get to him even benvolios urgings that hell find someone else to love at the banquet seem to have worked if not quite in the way he intended he just couldnt quite get there juliet herself well i think we see a lot of the mature woman that she could have become but she doesnt have a womans experience or resources yet and she ends up giving up rather than having the opportunity to grow which funnily enough her father predicts in the first act when paris asks for her hand in marriage with younger than she are happy mothers made and the dad answers with and too soon marrd are those so early made of course he then proceeds to do the opposite of his own advice but i dont think that undermines the message  elizabeth mentioned in her review that she thought there were a lot of comedic elements in this play i agree what with the servant characters the stupid mixups and that raillery that takes place between the minor members of the family and that one romeomercutio scene before the nurse interrupts them my closest guess is that was shakespeare saying look i could be writing this but instead you people want to see this stupid stupid tale enacted stupidly so i cant i can write this soapy crap if you want me to but this isnt who i am  or as mercutio says why is not this better now than groaning for love now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature for this driveling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole  and yet for all of that annoyance that satire that social criticism that biting realism for all of that shakespeare still gives this tale a beautiful sympathy putting gorgeous words into the mouths of his leads he makes romeo and juliet people people you can envision and who you know people you dont want to see die in spite of all their errors right there in front of you he respects the beauty in the craziness explores it in wonder he was after all a storyteller and if this was a story to affect people it deserved to be told and told as well as he knew it to be in him to do with a understanding that extends from his characters to the audience that wanted to see it  it is worth reading even if you think youve heard it all before after all even if you dont like it it is not so long as it is a tedious tale so i finally read this i regret everything  review to come i dont know if fortunately or unfortunately but i read the book in shakespearean english i did understand it but it was so difficult i got the plot and stuff i understood the story the way it is written i like the story a lot the ending even more in my opinion it is a bit too long but i still recommend it i think it will be better to read it in normal english since i read it like that short time ago and its much easier to understand it and it can be read in a much more fluent way i recommend you to read it in normal english its easier to chew it good play teenagers are wild and yet i wish but for the thing i have my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite  this is the first william shakespeare ive read and it was interesting how the conclusion is literally in line  of the prologue  it really isnt easy english to read very indirect sentences although at time the dialogue and wit is razor sharp for instance near the end romeo takes a shot at capitalism in a few sentences the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law the world affords no law to make thee rich then to be not poor but break it and take this my poverty but not my will consents  the drama and everything coming together conveniently including a sudden outbreak of the plague is quite reminiscent to victor hugo his writing much later overall the writing is very filmic you can see every scene before your eyes while reading and theres so much drama and tight packed events clustered into this with a lot of violence and death for instance the father of juliet responds as follows on the unfortunate infatuation of his daughter my fingers itch  wife we scarce thought us blest that god had sent us but this only child but now i see this one is one too much  there is some criticism to be given from a modern reader perspective nowhere do we really get to know why romeo and juliet love each other they are hardly fleshed out characters besides him apparently being an excellent swordsman and the whole family feud is nowhere clarified or charged with some kind of background and why would a friar have a magical potion and if he hadnt facilitated the kids every step along the way i think theyd be less spoiled and dead set on getting what they want  what i also found very funny beside romeo being compared to a dishcloth when rated against another suitor of juliet was how multiple characters comment on how only last week romeo was in love with rosaline that juliet is only  and already overdue in getting married according to her parents does not help in taking the whole plot and emotions felt by romeo and juliet very serious despite the grim ending a quick and quite fun classic about maybe more the dangers of teenage overdramatic tendencies than true love pers ive managed to live almost four decades without reading or watching this classic and i was pretty excited to get going on paper this is my ideal story boy meets girl girl already has boy in reality this wasnt my ideal at all the play format is really not my jam and the theres only so much of yee art thou donkey language that i can take  basically i didnt bond with anything except the bottle of poison  this piece of literature is often associated with romanticizing suicide so from that standpoint it was an interesting read for me and did i find it romantic no tragic most definitely yes  im sorry shakespeare maybe id do better with a more modern translation who am i kidding ill watch the film i was thinking the other day and decided hey why dont i write up a review for the worlds possibly most effed up play ever why not so im going to as you can probably tell this will not be eloquently written and in fact i do not give a flying purple monkey about the romanticism behind the idiocy that went down that one week in verona it all happened in on week because this play has bothered me since forever and it isnt about to change now on with the review   spoiler alert  over the ages people have swooned and very literally pined over and wished for a love such as romeo and juliets schnitzel most of the books published these days have the same pathetic starcrossed lovers theme to it its ridiculous really what little sadists we are on the inside because somehow a stupidstupidstupidboy killing himself when he finds the woman he loves deadafter gravedigging her out btwis suddenly the ideal fairytale and then that girl waking up to find him dead only to stab herself to death is instant true wuv    pssshh    no way is any of that effed up monkey business even intelligent one romeo you were a tool and secondly juliet you should have ceased the opportunity to live on he was totally in it for the sex i mean he liked that rosaline chick when he thought he could get his hands on her sex why not a severely younger girls nah it makes no difference right right  i declare bs it does so make a difference although i will admit to getting the whole back then they didnt care about age argument granted they didnt but within a week you cannot fall in love and then be willing to die for that love that is straight up whacked try telling me that is rational and i will deliver personally the flying monkey fist to your face because it isnt that kind of relationship is not love its obsessive creepily and utterly obsessive   and you know what this may even be a little hypocritical of me since i was all team dimitri and i accept that but at least rose wasnt   some theories i believe in   friar lawrence was the mastermind behind it all if he had slapped on an extra donkey to that letter the plan would have reached at least a day early its called express mail sucker  photobucket   both romeo and juliet really had no lives i mean i meet a guy i like within a week and things are great but for some reason i end up playing dead medieval princesses in my house and he comes over sees me dead and then proceeds to kill himself id be glad because the guy is a whole new level of messed who does that apparently romeo and juliet frick what happened to being selfdependent it seems that even in the fifteenth century it did not exist who can blame bella for going off the deep end there wasnt much too look up to anyway  and one thing i never could get  romeo how about you wait until shes really dead he must have been really thirsty took him no time at all to gobble up that poison i mean ever heard of water or rum bud  juliet this should have been you     that guy was finally gone why did we not party i would have liked a party  i will never love this play the timeline is ridiculous and the emotions too rash to ever be realistic shakespeare i love you and believe you are a genius but this is one piece of yours i will never like  while i agree with my past opinion of liking this play i would definitely have a much deeper and more appreciative opinion if i had read it now as my tastes have definitely matured since then      i do not care about this book or anyone in it at all weve been reading it in school for two months now and for the life of me i never enjoyed reading it once not even when i was assigned to read as the nurse which was actually kind of agonizing everyone in my english class would be assigned to read for a specific role in each class and we all hated it no one in my class liked this book i understand that its a classic so i should appreciate thembut no i dont see why i should have to slave through old english and the troubles of an instalovey forbidden romance plot please  romeo and juliet as everyone should know by now is a tragedy by shakespeare that illustrates the forbidden love between romeo montague and juliet capulet the montague and capulet families have personal vendettas against each other as has been going on for centuries but after romeo sneaks into a capulet party to find his rejected love rosaline he sets his sights upon juliet instead and they instantly fall in love its also so dramatically boring if you just read my plot summary and thought this would interest you it probably wouldnt  normally id continue this negative review by saying something i enjoyed about itbut i genuinely cant think of anything ive rated it two stars because i didnt think it matched the level of the catcher in the rye or the old man and the sea but there was still nothing good about this book at all the characters were all bland the romance was stale and i couldnt comprehend the writing if you feel like you should respond to that by saying youre so immature its shakespeare and old english then ill say yes thats true and just because it was written in the s doesnt mean i have to appreciate it or try understanding the old english or think that because its an old book i shouldnt need to love the plot or characters the same way i do with the typical books i read i know the writing is outdated and if its outdated then why are we even reading it  romeo and juliet were not in love im sorry to say im pretty sure the point of romeo and juliet is to differentiate between love and infatuation but i feel the need to come out and say that because my friend loved this book because of the romance romeo and juliet met when they were teenagers and made out within thirty seconds of meeting each other then they fell in love and got married within the week the whole book was some sort of instalove fantasy im sorry but i really dont see how this sort of plot appeals to people when i read about romance i want the storylines to feel real even if the point of this story was to illustrate that they werent really in love the way it was written was made to seem as if shakespeare wanted everyone to believe they were in love there didnt seem to be anything ironic about it  the fact that my english teacher wanted us to interpret certain scenes as comedic relief was actually funny to me no matter what context a man celebrating his daughters arranged marriage is not funny a priest ordering around his servants is not funny either way how am i supposed to find something funny if i can barely understand it are there some sort of medieval sex jokes that im missing or is shakespeare just a terrible comedian  i was so frustrated with most of these characters too romeo was impulsive and stupid juliet was a wet rag friar laurence was a manipulative failing grade the parents were all possessive paris and tybalt were possessive and the nurse was annoying why couldnt mr william shakespeare give me a break to enjoy the story for a second i legitimately wanted nothing to do with any of these characters and whenever someone would die i seriously wouldnt care  in conclusion romeo and juliet is a dry toerag of a book with no personality and a boring plot i guess it does kind of teach a lessondont commit suicide for a man you just met im sorry i just cant stand behind dusty old classics that i cant understand which therefore have no meaning to me andrea youre youngtoo young to understand these deep meaningsits a brilliant book thank you very much i dont think anyone with a perfectly functioning brain should be forced to like a book with outdated themes and language that they cant understand the amount of pure spite and enjoyment i got from onestarring this play is concerning never have thirteen year olds sounded so elegant and poetic yet acted like the biggest dumb dumbs well this has always been one of my least favorite shakespearean tragedies  i suppose ive always felt that shakespeare depends mostly on performance its not meant to be read until its been seen at least once and though ive seen one movie adaptation of this play as a child i dont think ive seen quite enough to form an opinion so instead of reading this in full i listened on audiobook  and you know what i think it wasnt enough i think i needed to see this again before listening to it moreover i think this is a play generally better seen than performed while the language is beautiful the emotionality of this play comes primarily from seeing these two young lovers  dumb yes but in love  kill themselves for what they believe when reading this its simply something happening something far away and removed when you see it  really see it see them gasping see them desperate and upset  its a call to action  romeo and juliet is at its core not a play about two lovers it is a play about how prejudice and hate can destroy the happiness of two innocents reducing it to they were stupid is missing the point they were stupid but if not for the hate of their families the feud that had been destroying their family for generations they would have survived dumb yes but they would not have died if not for the hate of generations past  i really dont have much else to say the language used in this play is gorgeous of course but among shakespeares tragedies the characters dont speak to me on quite the level others do yet i think this play has the potential to be fantastic if seen live with talented actors its a play that will chiefly depend on its performances but i think its a play worth seeing if you get the chance  baz lurhmann movie review can i just say this movie adaptation is completely wild the cinematography is weird and wild and completely all over the place on purpose as lurhmann often does the setting of the balcony scene is wonderful and beautifully done im a huge fan of everything about the opening scene which is so tonally odd that it sets a perfect tone for the show i actually think the mercutio performance in this one is my favorite several of the other characters are just a little bit flat although wellcast to emphasize the youth of the characters  audiobook performance review i liked calista flockharts performance while i felt she went too breathy at parts and didnt add the proper layer of characterization underneath all the innocence i felt her intonation conveyed her feelings quite well unfortunately i felt myself hardpressed to truly believe in matthew wolfs performance his intonation spoke to me of lust not of true love the only moment where i genuinely loved his character was in the final poisoning scene i was left near tears during his final monologue the only moment i truly felt strongly during the play shakespeare writes beautifully but that does not save this mushy tale i had seen countless versions in indian movies before i actually read it the romantic age  this one is entering her teens ripe for sentimental scenes has picked a gangling unripe male sees herself in a bridal veil presses lips and tosses head declares shes not too young to wed informs you pertly you forget romeo and juliet do not argue do not shout remind her how that one turned out   ogden nash exactly the three things i took away from this reading   romeo and juliet is and reads like an early work of shakespeares whether or not you believe he wrote it and so the scene executions are occasionally clunky and it lacks the subtly of his later work   regardless the story moves you when two people love one another and are kept from loving one another something must stir within your heart otherwise you may want to get your heart checked out   the third thing i took away was a questioning as a wise guy once wondered loudly aloud is it lovebabyor is it confusion romeo and juliet are very young i remember being  i had no idea what love truly meant i thought it had something to do with whether or not a girl was a looker and if she made my winky stand at attention i thought numerous times shes the one shes perfect there will never be another one for me i didnt know what i was talking about hell i didnt even know what me really meant and besides the definition of me changed a great deal from  to  to  without the definition of me the answer to who the one and only she is can not be known and all that is just a fraction of what goes into love its a base a mere beginning at best so how can romeo and juliet truly love each other especially so soon after first meeting and barely even knowing one another on that basis their love rings false ah but that does not matter these are not  or  year olds they are at least she is  and if they have feelings for one another that are rending their hearts apart isnt that all that matters even if we dont believe they are old enough to fully understand true love dont we have to respect what they are feeling on some level and if so then doesnt romeo and juliet ring as true as ever it could after all as another wise guy once posited a little less loudly i am human and i need to be loved just like everybody else does   rating note i hate the bland  star middle of the road choice especially when i dont consider a work bland or middle of the road but perhaps it fits this time more as an average of my emotions while reading so in the th century yearolds were able to fall in love and commit suicide all in less than a week now they get upset if they dont get the  likes they want on social networks newbies  this is the greatest love story of all times yes it happened in less than a month and there are men that after  years of being in a relationship still arent ready to get married i cant imagine what would have happened in a sixmonth marriage new home a couple of kidsa challenge to mother nature but times not important here after weeks of fighting over little things romeo developed a drinking problem juliet was heavily depressed the kids fell in love with their neighbors at a birthday party three deaths by stabbing and  months later big divorce either way they were doomed thats what happens when you rush into things  i love shakespeare the man described love hatred all kinds of human miseries with such a beautiful brilliant writing he had an extraordinary way of exploring his characters psyche hamlet for instance only the greatest tragedy of all times but romeo and juliet am i such a romantic no sometimes not sure what about after reading this play sorry i studied romeo and juliet for exams when i was around fifteen i remember appreciating the story then so i thought it was about time for a reread this story is so beautifully tragic it is bound to move you at some point in the tale unless of course you have a heart of stone when two people are deeply in love and then they are kept away from each other there has to be something that stirs within you it did for me this play is not just entirely about two lovers it teaches us how incredibly destroying prejudice and hate can be to innocents if it wasnt for the feud that had been going on for time the two lovers would have survived the language used in this play is simply beautiful and it is is certainly one of those stories that cannot be rushed through it needs to be savoured like the first cup of good coffee in the morning sadly i cannot give this a higher rating as although i liked this play i didnt love it read it when i was in school romeo and juliet  my first ever love story at that time i didnt understand it much but now it makes sense that how hatred among families can result in death of lovers a sad story indeed you know there actually isnt anything bad about this book but rather how badly it is taught in public high school this book wasnt for me i knew what i was getting into but i had no choice i had to read it for school and every single scene was a struggle the characters made the worst decisions and then wrote it off as being young have to say that this play was a disappointment i absolutely loved hamlet but romeo and juliet just fell flat for me full review to come this is my second time reading the play the first time i read it and hated it hence why i find the movie to be better than the book i thought since id grown older and loved many adaptions of the play i might be able to love it more while i didnt hate it i didnt love it either sure there are patches of beautiful writing but its not as consistent as with some of his other works sure it does have some humour but everything happens so quickly i wasnt able to connect to any characters you have to suspend your disbelief with the time frame of everything happening to enjoy it as much as i can be a huge romantic and love forbidden love stories youve also got to admit that this is probably the first case of instalove that ever existed i felt like too much was happening and too many characters i didnt care about had long passages to say however its still a classic and most people love it so you might love it too but i didnt and dont think i ever will the rating needs a little explanation maybe i am being too harsh but thats the rating i feel this book needs  so these are the reasons that romeo and juliet could have gotten a two star rating the language reading this out loud was actually a lot of fun there werent rough spots and it flowed very very nicely this made it easy to read a loud as it was meant to read aloud plus i had a lot of fun when the character i was acting died  two i enjoyed the character of tybalt it was interesting to see someone who still saw the family feud as a problem and was not wrapped up in the loveydovey nonsense  so sadly those are my only two reasons  now let me clear up a common misconception i can understand olde english perfectly fine it is not because of some language barrier that i missed the point and think my thoughts i read and understand olde english perfectly fine i read classics regularly the language is not a problem clear  however shakespeare manages to make some huge mistakes  this one is a huge pet peeve of mine and is done so often we can all agree that shakespeares works are not scifi or fantasy therefore the world building should be accurate which means that the endless references of greekroman gods and goddesses do not belong i love mythology but this is not the time and place for them in  when the real romeo and juliet lived no one would know about the ancient gods and goddesses stories histories art song etc were all under the veil of the church which would have censored and forbidden all research on pagan gods and goddesses no one would know they existed make your world building accurate  which brings me to my next point these arent even shakespeares stories theyre remakes yes he seriously changed any logical events and elizabethianized them but why is he getting the credit when he basically had no imagination at all  there was so much wasted potential the family feud could have been interesting that would have engaged me however the family feud isnt even a plot line its a slight fact so much wasted there  plus the little fighting bit with the feud was botched too normally theres a long period of mourning no dancing no parties no colour no suitors while i guess those fact werent convinent enough for you shakespeare  also i have 
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)+A17",im going to keep going until i succeed  or die dont think i dont know how this might end ive known it for years  harry potter  most seventeenyear olds dont view the possibility of an early death as being well possible but then again most seventeenyear olds havent come facetoface with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either  in harry potter and the deathly hallows the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular harry potter series jk rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in  truly rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every potterheads questions  and then some  not only does deathly hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books but rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books case in point near the end of the first potter book after hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of devils snare harrys best mate ron bellows have you gone mad are you a witch or not now six years later hermione finally gets her revenge on her redheaded friend when ron believes that all is lost until hermione yells to him are you a wizard or what thus reminding ron to use his wand to solve their problem subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes rowlings books so enjoyable to reread as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple readthroughs  harrys bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much rowling truly wrote harrys last tale for her longtime fans this line seems to read as a secret shoutout to the potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after the prophecy in the fifth book revealed that neither shall live while the other survives and therefore by the end of book seven either harry or voldemort had to die rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists turns and complications however that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end  more than any of the other potter books deathly hallows is a true quest narrative with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by voldemorts death eaters the multiple closecalls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale the book does after all chronicle a brutal war so be prepared for a lot of killing and consequently a lot of tears  this is not to say that deathly hallows doesnt offer up a great deal of laughs as well the hilarious twins fred and george weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isnt all doom and gloom by far the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show potterwatch anonymously hosted by former hogwarts quidditch commentator lee jordan with special appearances from fred george and exdefence against the dark arts professor remus lupin rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour tragedy and adventure so that her epiclength novel never lags or drags  to write a  page book that millions of diehard fans around the world are able to devour in less than  hours is no mean feat but rowlings farewell to the boy who lived is an incredibly gripping pageturner that will leave all potter lovers immensely satisfied its hard for me to believe that i finished the harry potter series i wish this series would go on forever i dont know how ive gone through my life without these books i regret not reading it when i was younger but i am so happy that i finally did better late than never right the world built in these books is so real and tangible it is truly a masterpiece the characters are engaging and brilliant and i love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself especially in this last book i was taken by surprise when i started the series i didnt think it would pull me in as it did as i kept reading through the books the characters slyly stole my heart now having finished the last line i am flooded with emotion this series is more than a story or words on a page it is magic i cant believe its over ive finally read the harry potter series and what an ending to the series this book was the sixyear buildup is over the final adventure towards which weve been sailing for  through six amazing hogwarts years  is here at last and yet again rowling surpasses her own standards to bring us the most adventurous book of the entire series to conclude everything is a most dramatic way twist after twist after twist is going to keep the reader immersed more than ever be warned once started you wont have a moments rest till your finish this one  twelve failsafe ways to charm witches  it seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about harry potter books in general  from plot to writing style  which never reached a plateau but kept on improving all of that is still there but setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything weve seen before and the complexity of the events has also been increased even the few supplots are highly detailed and complex and contributes a lot to the main story it gives a very fulfilling feeling when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end tying up a lot of loose ends also its unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced  whether they are happy or sad  maintaining suspense better than ever  permettezmoi to assister vous  the reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here but all that help make the ending much more satisfying i did miss the occasional humor though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now oh and im really happy that i only had to hate snape for a few days from finish of halfblood prince till now i guess thats the good thing about reading all the books of series at once less anxiety  wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure  when i started philosophers stone it made me realize that ive been missing out on a lot  a world of magic which is full of amazing characters then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way its been three magical weeks for me  literally and figuratively  from the starting of the first book till the last i dont recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as i did with harry potter and though the ending was great its sad not being able to continue to know that this is the end ive watched the first few hp movies a long time ago but those didnt come anywhere near the books in my opinion and i really wasnt a fan but now im finally enlightened as to why harry potter series is much loved by millions its impossible not to once youre through with the books a well thought out foundation put in place in first three books then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books while each book being a fivestar read at least for me harry potter became the my alltimefavorite book series  only the difference between truth and lies courage and cowardice i hadnt read this book in so long its been great to reread it and notice all the details i had forgotten  it was perfect for the holidays even though this one is quite dark happy thanksgiving to everyone celebrating today we all have so much to be thankful for this year and every year i am immensely thankful for books but in particular this series  i know im not original when i say the harry potter books are what made me fall in love with reading but they gave me a childhood far more magical and imaginative than i could have ever asked for they opened my eyes to a world beyond the one in which i lived the series taught me the value of empathy that courage comes in many different forms the importance of having and being a true friend that love is the greatest power above all and most importantly it taught me to believe in magic i would not be who i am today without these books and i love that stories have the power to do that to change lives for the better  i owe so much to this series which became such a massive part of my life and for that i will be forever thankful  it is finished  im thrilled to say that i managed to follow through with at least one book related commitment this year and that was to read the entire harry potter series for the first time its tough to pick a favorite from the group but the deathly hallows is a worthy contender for that coveted first spot as the dark tension that began growing at the finish of the goblet of fire has come full circle i felt this was the perfect finale to a rightfully highly acclaimed series im so happy to have finally experienced first hand this beloved story arc that so many readers hold dear to their heart im already trying to figure out when i can reread them  now on to our annual christmas time watching of the films while we wrap presents    gulp this was my pifm choice for the month of november in the a good thriller group here on goodreads i cant believe its finally time for my first read through of the harry potter books to come to an end but im also dying to read this one and see how it compares to the film though this is the least magical harry potter book the weakest the least whimsical the least logical it remains that i do consider it a  star book  keeping the differences in lord thingy and harry potter in mind the finale symbolically played out in the great hall of hogwarts could not have been better conceived  i was curious to see if i would cry again i did the princes tale gets to me every time the epilogue seems to belong to cursed child more than to deathly hallows but jk rowling is only human im a millennial and like most millennials i grew up with harry potter not just the books but we kinda aged with him or thereabouts its a coming of age story for our whole generation whether or not we received our hogwarts letters  and we were there together we were at midnight release parties and movie theaters lined up and excited to share in the adventure i cant think of the number of people who ive bonded with over these storiespeople who i wouldnt have thought to have much in common with in the first place we came from all different backgrounds much like the  houses and joined in the battle of hogwarts   we mourned the deaths of beloved characters     and cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others     we debated what harry should have done with the elder wand   but we never let go of this world we continue to relive these memories through fan fiction arts and crafts music food and drink and theme parks    being that it came out nearly a decade ago i think it holds up pretty well i always wonder how the characters are doing after a series ends after watching th anniversary of my all time best fantasy series feeling sorry for both roberts and watson i chose the last book to return back to the universe for saying see you soon to my favorite characters  even though the book is slow burn i didnt mind as long as i already know where it goes it might be my fourth time read and im so sure it wont be last  so many people may think why we connect with hp books so deeply my answer is it awakens different feelings that change at each people for me it brings out so many complex feelings an emotional trip in memory lane that reminds of my excitement at each time i start a new book of the series hope sadness fear always blended seeing my favorite characters growing up making mistakes choosing their paths and evolving are the best things ive witnessed  the entire final book focuses on harrys teaming up with his friends more like family ron and hermione to finish the task dumbledore gave them  the ending of the book gives us the epic final that has been promised from the beginning its big screen adaptation truly reflected the terror emotional breakdowns excitement of the conclusion even though making two additional movies from one book was not the best idea  prisoner of azkaban is gonna be my favorite book of the series the authors significant walk to the dark side and harrys big discovery about his godfather but it was still great to have fourth tango with the final book of the series  i think its time for me head out universal studios to visit hogswart and have a thrill ride for showing my tribute to this strongest installment of the century  lets see my favorite quotes it is the quality of ones convictions that determines success not the number of followers remus lupin  no harry you listen said hermione were coming with you that was decided months ago  years really  words are in my notsohumble opinion our most inexhaustible source of magic capable of both inflicting injury and remedying it  albus dumbledore  it is a curious thing harry but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it those who like you have leadership thrust upon them and take up the mantle because they must and find to their own surprise that they wear it well  albus dumbledore  all was well i remember when the hardback came out walmart was having a big to do at midnight but i worked rd shift at the post office at that time i stopped by after work around  ish am and there were a few copies left i was so excited and i ended up not getting much sleep and was tired that night at work because i couldnt put the book down  and i cried and cried i still do some of these books do that to me no matter how many times i read the books  happy reading  the true master of death does not seek to run away from death he accepts that he must die and understands that there are far worse things in the living world than dying albus dumbledore  to you yes you reader of this review  should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end i offer you my deep thanks for your resilience bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews youll ever read on goodreads you still have time to back out though so dont tell me you havent been warned  to jk rowling there is no argument about your brilliance you are a certified genius a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and i cant praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life but youre still human and surely youve recognized your flaws one of which is your penchant for killing your characters you cant blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to i accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but i find no good reason for the death of fred why why kill him havent you killed enough already why did he even have to die why not percy instead kidding i honestly think no weasley should have died for obvious reasons i dont think i still have to enumerate also i honestly believe the last book lacks at least  more pages why jump to  years later epilogue right after the devastating war dont the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them a simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss i have gone so far have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue also dont you think professor severus snape deserved a better more respectful way to die and whatever happened to professor moodysbody so you see even though i admire you with  percent of my heart  percent percent is resenting your choices but thank you now my heart is tougher and braver characters in the next books i read could all die and i probably wouldnt shed a tear i just wish i read your books before allegiant and mockingjay i probably would have considered those happy endings  to harry potter  i will never forget your brave and pure heart you showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage trustworthy instincts and strength of will oh and of course a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can  to hermione granger  you are the most kickass heroine ive ever met without needing to actually kick ass you only needed your intellect level headedness and kind heart and like ron said without you and your beaded bag he and harry would not have survived a day during your quest  to ron weasley  you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most i admire your loyalty sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for hermione than you  to fred and george  when in tears i could always count on you guys for a good laugh its no fun without you george its hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too oh gaaaaawd wails  to hagrid and graupy  hugs ill never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes thank you for your loyalty friendship and bravery you will be remembered for generations  to professor snape you are indeed the bravest of them all your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all your memories harry and i saw in dumbledores pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and i spent days and nights crying for you youre a true hero and you deserve a monument maybe ill name my son after you wails  to professor dumbledore  you are the true epitome of sacrifice love and humility you find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving  to dumbledores army led by neville luna ginny  you guys are awesome  to the order of the phoenix you were amazing especially you mrs weasley im so sorry for your losses but thank you thank you so much  to the hogwarts professors led by prof mc gonagall  you

am completely with harry you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you  to the rest of the fallen professor moody cedrick sirius remus tonks james and lily colleen creevey and many others like neville said your death was not in vain thank you wails  to the movie makers and actors  thank you for bringing to life the characters we love we will always look up to you people dont you dare disappoint us  to my goodreads friends who bullied me into reading harry potter thank you for destroying my life i was doing perfectly fine without these books you wrecked me pretty bad especially when i was reading the last book i felt like hundreds of dementors were surrounding me while reading it that i had to constantly cast a patronus charm while reading it was really exhausting my patronus is a baby elephant btw oh and im house gryffindor hurray im afraid im becoming worse than luna lovegood  to jia and kyra  happy birthday my young smart and beautiful friends march  is their actual birthday you are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages savor that gift and seize your most special day  do not pity the dead harry pity the living and above all those who live without love  it still feels weird to me me for finishing this series i mean i had read this series since august and i feel really  weird i feel like i just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago i feel like i just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago months ago i thought i would feel okay when i finished this series but i do not feel that way i feel  like empty or hollow on the inside you know what i mean right like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you cant because the story is over and there is nothing you can do the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better like you actually hug the main characters maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there  description  i always envy those people who grew up with harry potter series i envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me i was a muggle that time and i used to hate reading novels so much and i had never once thought that i would love reading novels as much as i love breathing  harry potter series also has a great impact in my life i was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading hp i wanted people to like me so i became what they wanted me to be and i rarely stood up for myself even when i knew i was right but harry potter series has changed me  you guys do know luna dont you many people called her  loony  because she believed in many things but luna didnt care what they called her she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time i realized i was such a stupid girl who let my socalled friends changed me to be the girl i didnt even want me to be and now my friends often say that i am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because i love reading books so much and you know what i just dont care about them anymore i dont care when they say about me such a weirdo because i am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who i am and luna also taught me one more thing when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it dont you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you these friends will accept who you are just like luna who has amazing friends harry ron ginny hermione and neville description  like i told you i used to be very shy that i never stood up for even myself few weeks ago my friend who always insulted me she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves the next thing i knew was that i snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and were friends now this series has changed me to be a braver person  i dont think i can say this is a review because its all about me and one more thing i will never ever forget nd may  i lost so many great friends remus tonks colin fred sirius and many more    i really want to say many thank you to mrs j k rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person thank you very much mrs j k rowling and thank you very much for reading this guys   ps i found all these wonderful pictures on google many thanks for the creators my oldest daughter and i started the harry potter series this past december and finished the last book today  it took me  months to read the  books out loud to her seven a magical number jk rowling would be proud  it was a reread for me the first time for her and as we closed the cover on the deathly hallows we experienced a moment of silent awe then one of us i wont say who shed a few tears  we sat there quietly staring at each other in wonder will we ever have a shared reading experience of this magnitude again  as we got up and stretched somewhat unsure of what to do with ourselves my daughter said mom i wish you really were magic right now you could point your wand at me and erase my memory of reading this and then i could start it for the first time all over again  of course it is happening inside your head harry but why on earth should that mean that it is not real rowling said her original epilogue was a lot more detailed including the name of every child born to the weasley clan in the past  years victoire who was snogging teddy  lupin and tonks son  is bill and fleurs eldest  harry ron and hermione we know that harry marries ginny and has three kids essentially as rowling explains creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child  as for his occupation harry along with ron is working at the auror department at the ministry of magic after all these years harry is now the department head  harry and ron utterly revolutionized the auror department rowling said they are now the experts it doesnt matter how old they are or what else theyve done  meanwhile hermione rons wife is pretty high up in the department of magical law enforcement despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in deathly hallows  i would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the dark arts operate would really give her a sound grounding rowling said  harry ron and hermione dont join the same ministry of magic they had been at odds with for years they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a really good place to be  they made a new world rowling said  the wizarding naturalist luna lovegood the eccentric ravenclaw who was fascinated with crumplehorned snorkacks and umgubular slashkilters continues to march to the beat of her own drum  i think that luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures rowling said shes a naturalist whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is  luna comes to see the truth about her father eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that dont exist  but i do think that shes so openminded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no ones ever seen before rowling said  luna and neville longbottom its possible luna has also found love with another member of the da  when she was first asked about the possibility of luna hooking up with neville longbottom several years ago rowlings response was definitely not but as time passed and she watched her characters mature rowling started to feel a bit of a pull between the unlikely pair  ultimately rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise felt too neat  mr and mrs longbottom the damage is done  there is no chance however that nevilles parents who were tortured into madness by bellatrix lestrange ever left st mungos hospital for magical maladies  i know people really wanted some hope for that and i can quite see why because in a way what happens to nevilles parents is even worse than what happened to harrys parents rowling said the damage that is done in some cases with very dark magic is done permanently  rowling said neville finds happiness in his grandmothers acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at hogwarts  the fate of hogwarts nineteen years after the battle of hogwarts the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster mcgonagall was really getting on a bit as well as a new defense against the dark arts teacher that position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at hogwarts since voldemorts death broke the jinx that kept a defense against the dark arts professor from remaining for more than a year  while rowling didnt clarify whether harry ron and hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year she did say she could see harry popping up every now and again to give the odd talk on defense against the harry potter changed my life and the memories i have associated with it can never be changed or tarnished no matter what its creator says or does her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused nevertheless like daniel radcliffe said the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that harry potter is no longer hers and i will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever and yes i will be rereading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime  however i can no longer support her or her future work rowling is transphobic and supporting her in any way shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the lgbtq community profoundly i cannot take back the money i have given her already but i can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets  i want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters this page is a good place to start  please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice mermaidsuk could be a place to start because they have been directly attacked by rowling and click here to find about more trans organisations in the uk and what you can do to help  if you still love harry potter thats okay but stop supporting rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets lets all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience  ps i have this on the signed section because my copy is signed by daniel radcliffe who in my head is now the real author of harry potter anyway and so it comes to a close this amazing series with a battle royal which of our most loved and most loathed characters will survive which side will prevail what secrets will be revealed in this final episode the harry potter series is one of the triumphs not only of modern marketing but of contemporary literature while the danger in any series exists that the joy of newness has rubbed off rowling keeps us interested by offering continued mystery diversity characters we can relate to and a palette of literary reference that gives resonance to her creation you will cry at the end but those tears may be because there will be no more harry potter books to readwell for a while anyway i started the harry potter audio books at the end of august  it took me a little over  months to listen to them all i fit a few others inbetween but im so happy i finally finished if you havent read them before or youre a long time fan looking for a reread i cant recommend the audio books enough jim dale does a fantastic job with the narration i can see myself going back one day and listening to them all over again  now to the final book of the series harry potter and the deathly hallows the book begins with harry ron and hermione on the run doing the task that dumbledore gave harry to be honest the first part of the book and by first part i mean the first  or so was a little slow for me there were exciting things to pop up here and there but a lot of it was slow then the last few hours of the audiobook happened ive gotta say once this trio got back to hogwarts the ending was epic there were moments of sorrow moments that made me laugh smile cry it was very emotional gawd that snape scene i cant even it made me cry like a baby and love a character i didnt care for much im pleased with the way it ended  overall this series has been fantastic for me im so glad i finally made the time to read them all ive always loved the movies and been a fan but now i feel like i need to go and rewatch everything harry potter is a heartwarming series with courageous characters that i will hold near and dear to my heart after  years of procrastination ive finally finished the harry potter series no one speak to me for at least another  years  but in all seriousness this has been an amazing adventure and ive fallen in love and im a blubbering mess so im just going to leave it at that wow  so ive never reviewed this before because what can you say about it i bought it at a midnight release party devoured it and knew that i loved it  but now that ive spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son i understand why i loved it so much does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what rowling did with this book she spent years upon years and six other books building a world and populating it with characters and then she brought it and them all together spells tools people events that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books wer
1984,you are the dead oh my god i got the chills so many times toward the end of this book it completely blew my mind it managed to surpass my high expectations and be nothing at all like i expected or in newspeak double plus good  let me preface this with an apology if i sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review i cant help it my mind is completely fried  this book is like the dystopian lord of the rings with its richly developed culture and economics not to mention a fully developed language called newspeak or rather more of the antilanguage whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it the worldbuilding is so fully fleshed out and spinetinglingly terrifying that its almost as if george travelled to such a place escaped from it and then just wrote it all down  i read fahrenheit  over ten years ago in my early teens at the time i remember really wanting to read  although i never managed to get my hands on it im almost glad i didnt though i would not have admitted it at the time it would have gone over my head or at the very least i wouldnt have been able to appreciate it fully  from the start the author manages to articulate so many of the things i have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words even in the first few chapters i found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of mr orwell  for instance he talks about how the act of writing itself is a type of time travel it is communicating with the future i write these words now but others may not discover them for hours weeks or even years for me it is one time for you the reader it is an entirely different one  just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers i related to winston so much in that way i would have found a way to read or write  the politics and psychology of this novel run deep the society in the book has no written laws but many acts are punishable by death the slogan of the party war is peace is entirely convoluted individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the party  i also remember always wondering why the title was  i was familiar with the concept of big brother and wondered why that wasnt the name of the book in the story they dont actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the ministry of truth it could very easily have been  i think that makes the title more powerful something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people they have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is they dont have the right to keep track knowledge is powerful knowledge is necessary but according to big brother ignorance is strength   is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition recounting events and explaining the society these are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters but orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled he frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing none the less i must admit that i zoned out a bit while winston was reading from the book but i was very fascinated by the culture  sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person this is not the case with this book as it is written in third person yet i never failed to be encompassed in winstons feelings george manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them with the exception of the beginning when winston is just starting to become awakened i developed a strong attachment to winston and thrived on living inside his mind i became a member of the thought police hearing everything feeling everything and last but not least what the thought police are not allowed to do questioning everything  i wasnt expecting a love story in this book but the relationship between julia and winston was truly profound i enjoyed it even more than i would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful i wasnt sure whether he was going to eventually betray julia to the party or not but i certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship  george has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons whether its at war with ourselves or with others that is one thing i have never understood why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other  it seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing one censorship is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world the other brainwashing is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas both can be extremely dangerous  inside the ministry of truth he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence we also spend quite a bit of time with winston in the ministry of love where the brainwashing takes place those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey big brother and serve only the interests of the party  a common theme occurred to me throughout the book although it wasnt necessarily referenced consistently the good of the many is more important than the good of the one there are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say of course the many is more important than the one but when inside winstons head all that i began to care about was his wellbeing and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the party and big brother i just wanted him to be at peace  whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one i cant answer i think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the worlds and maybe thats part of the problem but its also human nature i only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people maybe im naive for thinking that way but so be it  i almost dont know what to think about this book im not even sure my brain still works or if it ever worked right at all this book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything its the strangest thing hmmm doublethink perhaps perhaps not  everything about this book is captivating its groundbreaking yet at the same time purely classic ahead of its time yet timeless from big brother to the thought police i was hooked and wanted to know more about it all  basically i think everyone should read  at some point you really have to be in the mood to work at reading it though but its all worth it in the end its absolutely incredible and i loved it i dont reread many books but this will definitely be one of them it is a hard read but more importantly it is a must read  is not a particularly good novel but it is a very good essay on the novel front the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through as a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling as an essay the points it makes can be earthshaking it seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a dystopia every administration that reaches for power injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing big brother these are the successes of s paranoia far outliving its original intent as a battery against where communism was going orwell was a severely disappointed marxist and while people who compare their leaders to big brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from orwells intent and vision it is a useful catchcloth for dissent like so many immortalized books with a social vision s actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fearmongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers if youd like a better sense of the real world and orwells intents rather than thirdhand interpretations of his fiction then his homage to catalonia is highly recommended  this was the book that started my love affair with the dystopian genre and maybe indirectly influenced my decision to do a politics degree i was only  years old when i first read it but i suddenly saw how politics could be taken and manipulated to tell one hell of a scary and convincing story im a lot more wellread now but back then this was a gamechanger i started to think about things differently i started to think about      and i wanted to read more books that explored the idea of control im gonna ask myself a mandatory question and say nothing more  why the fuck had i not read this book before i am a big fan of speculative fiction and in my literary travels i have encountered a myriad of dystopias antiutopias and places and societies that make one want to scream andphotobucket with or without contemporaneous loss of bladder and other bodily functions  simply put george orwells  is unquestionably the most memorable and most disturbing vision of a world gone mad utterly batshit psycho that i have ever experienced ever despite being published back in  i have yet to find a more chilling nightmarish locale than orwells iconic world of big brother and ingsoc the very mention of either of those terms invokes images of nazis and soviet gulags in my mind yet orwells creation is in many ways even more insidious than these realworld bogeymen  i first read this book when i was  years old in th grade as aget thisclass reading assignment looking back on it i have no idea why on earth we were reading this book at that age but i do recall we spent quite a bit of time discussing it i wish i could recall the substance of those discussions because i can only imagine the kind of piercing insight that a group of hormonally challenged preteens thought up in regards to this book needless to say i think that this is a book that is best appreciated after your first pimple  anyway i decided to reread this book recently as an adult in the hopes that i would be able to gain a great appreciation for this classic well the book did more than that it absolutely floored me from the very first sentence it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking thirteen to the unforgettable final sentence which i will not give away here this story sucked me in beat the living shit out of me and through me out the other side a hollow wasted wreck i know it doesnt sound very cheery but it is a lifechanging experience  i have always thought that one of the best and most important qualities of science fiction is that it frees the author to take the controversial politically charged issues and trends of the day and create a possible future based on exaggerations of such trends and in so doing present a compelling and critical argument for change well no one has ever done a better job than better orwell in showing the possible nightmare and thus potential danger of a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control  this book is bleak dreary frightening upsetting and absolutely brilliant and one of my all time favorite novels highest possible recommendation  stars it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking thirteen  this changed the way that i looked at ideologies and changed the way i looked at leadership cynical scathing and not without its flaws this is still a stark haunting glimpse at what could be  war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength  chilling  the closing lines still come to me sometimes and remind me of depths that i can only imagine  he gazed up at the enormous face forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache o cruel needless misunderstanding o stubborn selfwilled exile from the loving breast two ginscented tears trickled down the sides of his nose but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished he had won the victory over himself  he loved big brother    addendum  it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which i frequently think the scene that i most often think is when winston and julia are captured    reread  lost in my memory was to what extent orwell describes and explains his nightmare winston smith cautiously and surreptitiously discovers the brotherhood led by goldstein and then learns all too well about obriens duplicitous doublethink  more than just a cautionary political tale orwell has described an ideological abyss into which we must not gaze a glimpse at authoritarianism power plays to which the nazis and soviets never descended while we can appreciate the reminder to avoid authoritarianism and his prophetic vision the idea that truth can be arranged through media is perhaps the most relevant for us today    reread  this time around i focused on the human side of this iconic novel  especially the relationship between winston and julia in the past i have somewhat overlooked julia as a character and thought that orwell had neglected to form a strong female character however i now think that she is every bit as strong as winston and plays a central role in orwells message  whereas winston hates the party and wants to overturn it julia is much more practical and realistic in her rebellion winston thinks about the nature of the totalitarianism in abstract ways julia uses the terms of doublethink against the party and makes her frank sexuality a systematic rejection of party principle  while orwell was forming a cautionary tale based upon his own experience in writing against authoritarian regimes like stalins hitlers both actually named in the text and by extension moa mussolini and franco it occurs to me that the irony of winstons dystopia is at least to some degree focused on the party members themselves winston embodies the use of media as propaganda and to disseminate inaccurate statements that prop up the party in todays world we are already seeing this kind of abrogation of truth in favor of party purity  every bit as timeless and relevant as it has ever been i know this is a well loved classic and i definitely enjoyed some parts but some times i found myself a bit bored s social media is a cage full of starved rats and all of us have our heads stuck in there now like it or not i wanted to understand the origin of the expression big brother associated with our modern world and i immersed myself in  by george orwell this novel of anticipation published in  is striking we follow the destinies of winston and julia in this universe which is reminiscent of ours or what it could become of course it is a fable but the images strike and remain used for a long time after reading this cult novel we look at certain realities differently it is a detour that is worth it a must why did i wait so long to read it newspeaking ones way towards manufacturing consent with optional mutilating death by torture after brainwashing because these pesky citizens just dont get to the core of the fact that ingsocs war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength police is based on hard serious humanities such as politics economics and sociology  its just reality the irony lies in the fact that it just seems like the nightmarish tale of a forever dictatorship for the privileged people living in western brave new world pseudo democracies while its painful reality for billions of people the severity may vary but there are so many regions and states out there in the world where the i should be silent to avoid secret torture prisons and internment aka death camps thought is a part of daily life an epigenetic standard nutrition kids are born with  one character struggling makes it even more intense orwellschoice to just focus on one storyline and the backstory makes it so compelling while the dismal and depressing atmosphere pulls the reader into big brothers surveillance state with its secret police and euphemistic ministries  checklisting how much has become real even in democratic countries there is vast control of information media and the consensus of which economic and political doctrines are dogmas that mustnt be criticized or doubted permanent warmongering with especially the us invading or supporting war parties this is combined with discrediting even not radical just progressive alternative political parties ngos and citizen movements that are too defiant good old divide and rule style just swallow it democracy is dead but at least progressive critical voices are just ignored and not killed thanks to the  military industrial complex public private partnershipping the last drop out of dysfunctional intentionally destroyed distributional justice and eco social market economy a great problem that emerges from the corporations controlling all democratic european and the us governments probably the asian south american ones australia etc too is that they actively promote any kind of authoritarian leadership in countries they have economic interests in thereby actively helping in spreading big brother exaggeration sadly a clear nope read chomsky klein colin crouch ziegler shiva vandana etc all the critical unheard voices denouncing neoliberalism neoconservatism neocolonialism and globalization or call me a leftist conspiracist and trust politicians and journalists far more easygoing i should really consider to stop committing thoughtcrimes  as if any ethical democratic western government or a conglomerate of all of them would go full economic warfare mode  and unleash fictional entities like lets just for fun call them world building mode activated world bank international monetary fund and world trade organisation who exploit all weak and poor members while brave new worlding its own population or lets get even more ridiculous and call a fictional superpower united states of eurasia who loves to step over the final border of actively promoting wars for just economic and geopolitical reasons to directly smash democracies to breed more big brothers since lets pick any number   i just love the uchronia and alternative history genre its both so dark and ironic  similar stuff this is added to my review of brave new world too besides the  behemoths karel capeks  dark disturbing masterpiece is possibly one of the best dystopian terror pieces its focusing on the role of big money and industry of innocence turned into the same evil it suffers was written in  and satirizes germans japanese russians societies ideologies and economy in general and is a timeless memorial against political and economic terrorism and extremism of any kind aldous huxley was orwells college professor and they definitively inspired and mentally inseminated another to form these brave new worlds zamyatin yevgenys we is another historical extremely interesting piece although just not as famous and fancy as the others kind of the same problem as with the underappreciated capek  an extremely difficult to read one is stand on zanzibar by john brunner  which comes very close to huxleys ideas but is much darker some more dark and or satiric tones   a similar idea by the master of philosophical satirical scifi the great unique lem   subjectively i do find it much more attractive that we wealthy westerners live in friendly brave new worlds with fringe pseudo democracy and not in orwellian or capekian horror visions as many other poor people around the world do  ive put off writing a review for  because its simply too daunting to do so i liked  even better after a second reading bumping it up from a  star to a  star because i think that given the complexity of the future created by orwell multiple readings may be needed to take it all in i thought it was genius the first time and appreciated that genius even more the second time  orwell had a daunting task creating a future nearly half a century away from the time period in which he was writing this future had to be its own complex independent society but it also had to be the natural end result of the totalitarianism orwell witnessed in the communist and socialist regimes of world war ii thats part of the horror of  this future is a recognizable one even in the st century its easy to see how those in control can through manipulation and propaganda maintain that control simply for the sake of sating their own power hunger its easy to say no one could ever tell me what to think or what to do but the partys use of big brother the thought police the twominute hate and doublethink make it easy to see how a persons ability to think independently and discern fiction from reality can be eroded when there is no touchstone to fact revising and rewriting the past to make certain that big brother and the party are always correct has effectively eliminated historical accuracy how can one think and reason in a society where everything is a fabrication  another facet of  that i find fascinating is the relationship between winston and julia winston claims julia is a rebel from the waist down engaging in promiscuity and hedonistic indulgences forbidden by the party she doesnt care about social injustice or defining reality she only longs for what will make her feel good in the moment and only rebels far enough to get what she wants by comparison winston is an intellectual rebel constantly worrying over the issues of truth and freedom and the real unvarnished past but limited in how far hes willing to push the boundaries until he meets julia together they make a complete rebellionphysical and mental but apart they find themselves impotent to stand up to the party  a cautionary tale social commentary and exemplary example of dystopian fiction  is one of those perfect novels that not only entertains but forces one to think about the danger associated with giving any one person or entity too much power or control over our livesissues well worth consideration in post america   europe was only starting to recover from the slaughter of world war ii nazi germany had been crushed by the russian army in the east and by the angloamerican forces in the west the totalitarian regimes of hitler mussolini and imperial japan were defeated stalin was going strong franco was undisturbed however the war was not quite over the victors russia on one side the usa on the other were now superpowers staring stonily at each other their hands loaded with a new and deadly arsenal  orwell wrote  right after animal farm in this ominous postcoldperpetualwar context and many aspects of it are steeped in the horrors of tyranny dehumanisation and disaster winston smith the wretched protagonist lives in an alternate history where everyone is under constant surveillance via telescreens and widespread denunciation a place where propaganda misinformation history rewriting language and thought manipulation reality control  are pervasive tools to make every individual conform with the ingsoc partys ideology the result is a diehard totalitarian state a perfect hell on earth where individuality is vaporised at the whim of a spectral big brother and where even love is impossible  worth highlighting in the novel the long interlude about the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism ii   inserted within a slightly incongruous romance episode  and the appendix on the principles of newspeak  written as if from an unknown point far in the future when the madness has eventually subsided both sections are stupefying yet the last third of the book is probably one of the worst nightmares in literature a prolonged torture and brainwashing session that plunges into utter insanity  erich fromms afterword included at the end of the signet classics paperback edition rightly puts  in perspective with its historical context and other works of speculative fiction like brave new world still while huxleys satire is substantially ironic almost jovial the general tone in orwells book is dismal revolting at times practically unbearable at any rate this novel has become one of the canonical landmarks of political dystopia hannah arendt possibly read  when writing the origins of totalitarianism a couple of years after orwells death its influence after that on works like the handmaids tale is manifest as well  michael radfords heartrending film adaptation is very faithful to the novel but my favourite film freeadaptation remains brazil by terry gilliam blade runner too borrows much of its  los angeles architecture from s miniluv pyramidal building descriptions  the days of hitler and stalin are long gone now even so almost a century later in a time of political paralysis and corruption where the most prominent doubleplusgood duckspeaker politicians of the world make ample use of a new form of newspeak and doublethink in a time of threatened privacy and increasing digital surveillance and mindfuck orwells prophetic warning is as relevant as ever yes this book amazing terrifying brutal intricate prophetic  and in one big word genius  this was a reread  the last time i read this was over  years ago and i wanted to see if the  star rating and its standing in one of my top  favorite books held up  and it most certainly does  if this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out it may not have stood out but this book was way ahead of its time written in a post wwii era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future  this is where the genius of orwell comes in the book is mainly the manifesto of the party that the main character is seeking to rebell against but the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way  they are fascinating the fact that orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment but the rules for the new language they were creating is beyond amazing  finally some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world the controversial elections this week in the us only added to the intensity of this book  read this especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia you must read the fore fathers   and brave new world  and remember  big brother is watching praise the lord and pass the amunition i am finished with this beast of a book my brain feels like sludge i just want to crawl into a hole and forget all that was engrained into my poor head why oh why did i have the noble idea to read such a monster how am i supposed to rate such s i believe like some of you that this might have been better had i read it in a class or with a group alone it was fingernails to chalkboard miserable  after reading this it just makes you feel hopeless  hallelujah its over never again orwell never again  sidenote i did a little experiment on facebook about this book i wrote in my status that i was reading  anybody have any opinions almost everyone of the commenters wrote how much they enjoyed this book and how it was one of their favorite books ever while i am sure that maybe  of them was being truthful i have to doubt atleast half of them now i ask why do people lie about certain books do they think it makes them look smarter cooler wellrounded i just dont get it if you dont like something you dont like it its not neccessary to like it for classic book sake this might not be making sense to some of you maybe you would have to know the people who were commenting i dont know but i am sure all of you have been in a bookstore or talking with a coworker etc and they spout out some well known hip book that they just adore you know this person and its hard to see them reading period much less what they are talking about  i guess my point is dont be a fake book talker like it yay dont like it yay im not going to think less of you for not liking something you should like by literary standards im not making any point in particularjust that if you have any intention of reading a book about totalitarianism and apocalyptic government written by a man who believed in democratic socialism as the solutionwell now might be a good time   full review  i had been meaning to read this book for a long time but i finally did it based on a friends hi dario insistence it took me way longer than expected to finish it and once i managed said friend requested in all caps a textmessage review here is that unaltered review for your perusal  message  i thought it was mostly a vessel for a certain line of thinking  message  which was carried across in goldsteins book and obriens dialogue at the end  message  and while those passages were smart and worthy of publication they ultimately would have been more effective as an essay  message  but nowhere close to as many people would have read it as an essay  message  anyway in the end i thought much of it was unnecessary but overall its a deeply impressive work  message  i was lowkey astonished at how long the goldstein passages were  message  but some of the ideas there were remarkable  message  i found myself skimming at some points and then i was mad at myself for skimming bc its like the whole point of the book and then i was mad at the author for conveying the most important ideas in such a lazy way  fin  in conclusion yes i am the type of nightmareperson who responds to texts by breaking up sentiments into dozens of messages  sorry  bottom line this was good but i wish it had been one or two political opinion papers instead sorry again goodness gracious this was very unsettling im already a pretty paranoid person so the idea of big brother was both very intriguing but also extremely frightening i really enjoyed reading this but there were moments when i wasnt invested in the story and wanted to take a break from it mostly in the last half of the book still definitely worth the read though what can i possibly say about this amazing novel  by george orwell that hasnt been already said by many who have read the book for over half a century when it is said that the book is haunting nightmarish and startling any reader would have to agree this well known novel grips the reader from the beginning and does not even let go of the grip at the finished reading a classic you wont want to miss if you havent taken the time to read it yet i actually listened to this novel on audio and simon prebble was the perfect narrator read as part of the infinite variety reading challenge based on the bbcs big read poll of   for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves and when once they had done this they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away  nineteen eightyfour is an insanely relevant novel in this day and age but its also a rather soothing novel that contains some of the horrors that could never come to pass though there are some horrific parallels between the england in the book and some countries around the world in the st century  winston is a very complex sane person in a world full of insanity and utter destitution julia is on par with winston but other than the charming and mysterious obrien no other character is developed enough to be anything but a filler someone to push the plot along in any other novel this would be a bad thing but in this world it is perfect and its exactly what those people are in any case  it is so superbly written i cannot fault it at all concerning that at the beginning i was drawn in so far that i was almost in love it was a fivestar book up until julia turned up whilst i completely understand her character and her paradoxical nature being so openly physically against big brother and yet intelligencewise and mentally not i did not like her even remotely but i understood her character fully the other thing that put me off was the huge infodump whilst i completely understood that this was an intentional infodrop and it really could not have been conveyed to either the reader or the character in any other way it really made the whole thing very disjointed again it felt hugely intentional but i still did not enjoy it  overall theres really nothing i can fault except my own opinions good writing is fact punctuation in the correct places the rig
The Kite Runner,finished this book about a month ago but its taken me this long to write a review about it because i have such mixed feelings about it it was a deeply affecting novel but mostly not in a good way i really wanted to like it but the more i think about what i didnt like about the book the more it bothers me i even downgraded this review from two stars to one from the time i started writing it to the time i finished  lets start off with the good shall we the writing itself was pretty good when it comes to description in that i really felt the authors descriptions of scenes and in terms of moving the story forward that said its not particularly challenging writing to read  the very best part of the novel is its warm depiction of the mixed culture of afghanistan and how it conveys the picture of a real afghanistan as a living place before the coup the soviet invasion and above all the taliban and the aftermath of september th created a fossilized image in the us of a failed state petrified in backwardness and locked in the role of a villain from central casting  now for the not so good   spoiler alert   because i dont think im going to be able to complain about what i didnt like about the book without revealing major plot points not to mention some of what follows will only make sense to someone who has read the book so if you dont want to spoil it for yourself read no further here be spoilers  my overwhelming emotion throughout the book is feeling entirely manipulated of course one major reason for this is that the authors attempts at metaphor allegory and forshadowing are utterly hamfisted when he wants to make a point he hits you over the head with it hard  amirs split lip  hassans cleft palate comes immediately resoundingly to mind  but i feel manipulated beyond that the members of the servant class in this story suffer tragic unspeakable calamities sometimes at the hands of our fine hero and yet the novel seems to expect the reader to reserve her sympathies for the wronged privileged child beating his breast over the emotional pain of living with the wounds he has selfishly inflicted upon others how why am i supposed to feel worse for him as he feels bad about what he has done to others rather than feeling most sympathy and kinship for those who through absolutely no fault of their own must suffer not just once or twice but again and again  of course this elevation of  identification with the woundedflawed hero goes hand in hand with an absolutely detestable portrayal of the members of the servant class as being at their utmost happiest when they are being their most servile and utterly subjugating their own needs wants desires pleasures  their own selves in fact  to the needs of their masters even when they are protecting their masters from their own arrogance heartlessness or downright stupidity  i dont see how the main character amir could possibly be likeable amirs battle with assef momentous as it is is not so much him taking a stand because he feels driven to do so or feels that he must rather he acts with very little selfagency at all  he is more or less merely carried forward into events and moreover in the end it is sohrab hassan again who saves him  i finished the novel resenting amir and even more intensely resenting the author for trying to make the reader think shes supposed to care about amir more than about anyone else in the story  a couple other points im wondering if one theme of the novel is that there are no definitive happy endings no single immutable moments of epiphany or redemption because amirs moral triumph such as it is over assef is so shortlived he manages to crash horrifically only a week or two later when he goes back on his word to sohrab about his promise not to send him to an orphanage  and lastly i dont understand why babas hypocrisy is not more of a theme he makes such a point of drilling into his sons head that a lie is a theft of ones right to the truth his own hipocrisy there is a profound thing and its a shame the author doesnt do more with it  nevertheless after all the bad things i had to say about it i do have a couple quotes worth keeping  every woman needed a husband even if he did silence the song in her p  thats the real afghanistan agha sahib thats the afghanistan i know you youve always been a tourist here you just didnt know it p   this is the sort of book white america reads to feel worldly just like the spate of native american pop fiction in the late eighties this is overwhelmingly colonized literature in that it pretends to reveal some aspect of the other culture but on closer inspection aside from the occasional tidbit it is a thoroughly western story firmly ensconced in the western tradition  even those tidbits hosseini gives are of such a vague degree that to be impressed by them one would have to have almost no knowledge of the history of afghanistan nor the cultural conflicts raging there between the shia and sunni muslims or how it formed a surrogate battleground for russia and the united states in the cold war or for colonial conflicts in the centuries before sadly for all the daily news reports about afghanistan most people know very little of its history  hosseinis story is thickly foreshadowed and wraps up so neatly in the end that the reader will never have to worry about being surprised every convenient coincidence that could happen does happen he does attempt to bring some excitement to the story with dramatized violence but thats hardly a replacement for a wellconstructed plot he is also fond of forcing tension by creating a small conflict between two characters and then having them agonize over it for years despite the fact that it would be easy to fix and the characters have no reason to maintain the conflict and since the conflict does not grow or change over time everything is quickly reduced to petty and repetitive reactions  he even creates a cliched white devil character a literal sociopath and pedophile as the symbol for the evils of the taliban this creates an odd conflict in the narrative since one of the main themes is that simple inequalities and pointless conflicts stem from afghan tradition itself his indelicate inclusion of wealthy beautiful white power as the source of religious turmoil in the mideast negates his assertion that the conflicts are caused by smallmindedness  the fact that this character seems to have the depth of motivation of a disney villain also means that he does not work as a representation of the fundamental causes of colonial inequality which tend to be economic not personal the various mixed messages about the contributors to the ongoing afghan conflict suggest that hosseini does not have anything insightful to say about it  perhaps the worst part about this book is how much it caters to the ignorance of white america it will allow naive readers to feel better about themselves for feeling sympathy with the larger mideast conflict but is also lets them retain a sense of superiority over the muslims for their backwards classicist warlike ways in short it supports the condescending parental view that many americans already have about the rest of the world and it does all this without revealing any understanding of the vast and vital economic concerns which make the greater mideast so vitally important to the future of the world  it is unfortunate that nowhere amongst this books artfully dramatized violence and alternative praising and demonizing of the west is there the underlying sense of why this conflict is happening of what put it all into place and of why it will continue to drag us all down the point where it could turn sympathy into indignation or realization is simply absent  there is a bad joke on the internet showing a map of the world with the mideast replaced by a seafilled crater with the comment problem solved what this map fails to represent is that there is a reason the west keeps meddling in the affairs of the mideast and that every time we do it creates another conflictbecause almost every group who we decry as terrorists now were originally trained and armed by the us and western powers to serve our economic interests  as long as we see extremists as faceless sociopaths we can do nothing against them we must recognize that normal people fall down these paths and that everyone sees himself as being in the right who is more right the westerner whose careless bomb kills a child or the muslims that does  the point shouldnt be to separate the good muslims from the bad muslims because people arent fundamentally good or bad they are fundamentally people almost without exception they are looking out for their future their children and their communities calling someone evil merely means you have ceased to try understanding their point of view and decided instead to merely hate because its easier to remain ignorant than to try to understand  this book isnt particularly insightful or wellwritten but that is in no way unusual in bestsellers the problem is that americans are going to use this book to justify their ignorance about the problems in the east this book will make people feel better about themselves instead of helping them to think better about the world  for an actually insightful touching view of the afghan conflict i would suggest avoiding this bit of naive melodrama and looking up emmanuel guiberts the photographer due to the large number of negative comments ive received including death wishes ive added the following request  please do not take this review or yourself too seriously when reading it  i became what i am today at the age of twentynine on a frigid overcast day in the winter of   what i am about to tell you about what i became is going to be very shocking it is going to manipulate your emotions it may include some random words in my native language for no reason whatsoever it will teach you unnecessary things about my culture it will not be smarter than a fifth grader and it will include as many cliches and as much foreshadowing as is humanly possible  you are going to be shocked i for one never saw it coming so i doubt you will get ready arent you so ready to be shocked youre never going to see this coming  what comes next is the big revelation so get ready  wait i need to ask you something first did you know that the irish like potatoes yeah we really enjoy them and alcohol too its pretty great erin go bragh this means ireland forever unfortunately you will be very sad to know that my father just died due to an irish car bomb well about  of them to be exact all on an empty stomach it makes me sad and you should feel sad too kind reader  ok on to the big reveal here it is  on that frigid overcast day which happened to be the day that i decided to quit reading the kite runner i became a book snob  because the kite runner is adored by most people who read it i am forced to conclude that most people need to read more a whole lot more you should be embarrassed if you like this book seriously the moment i became a book snob shortly after the scene i became so embarrassed to be seen reading it that i accused the guy sitting next to me on the subway of putting the book on my lap while i wasnt paying attention how dare you sir have you no decency i exclaimed excitedly in my native language then i noticed a monkey on the platform waiting to board a train i quickly hopped off my train ran to him handed him the book and said top o the mornin to ya enjoy  later that day i saw that monkey flying a kite in front of the washington monument i noticed that the glass string wasnt making his hands bloody do you know why he was wearing gloves   please note that i have absolutely no appreciation for life and reality  bart bondeson who claims to be a better person for having read this book suggested that i make this clarification to my review thanks for the suggestion bart hopefully that clears things up for those who were wondering its been a while since ive been this frustrated with a main character i really wanted to like this novel judging from its thousands of fivestar reviews hailing it as the one of the best books ever written im in the minority when i state that this novel while wellintentioned just left a little bit of sour taste in my mouth  my problems with the novel are as follows first of all the writing itself is so hamfistened heavyhanded distracting and otherwise puzzling that by the midway point i seriously considered chucking the book against the wall each page of the novel has at least  incomplete sentences im all for experimental and fractered prosebut its important for authors to use it judiciously hosseini unfortunately beats it to death a lot of his language is cliched too which is funny considering theres a passage in the book about a writing teacher who warns the narrator amir about using cliches i dont know if that was supposed to be funny or not but it made me laugh and what was worse was the san franciscos chronicles glowing review on the books cover and the san francisco chronicles glowing review of amirs novelcoincidence  the authors use of farsiespecially in the dialoguewas equally distracting my point is that no one speaks the way his characters speak people dont switch back and forth between languages while speaking and if they do they certainly dont speak  the sentence in english say one word in farsi then traslate the farsi word to english then finish the sentence in english when theyre presumably speaking farsi to begin with i didnt pick up this book for a crash course in colloquial farsi after  pages i was frustratedand annoyed  hosseinis plot often borders on the ridiculous thetwists are just too coincidentaland not surprising at all except in how contrived they are for example in a devasted kabul amir sees a homeless man in the street the homeless man of course was a former university professor who just happened to teach with amirs long deceased mother what a coincidence what makes it worse is that the narrator amir then explains that while that may in fact seem like a coincidence it happens in afghanistan happens all the time of course it does in another example amirs former nemesis assaf now a taliban crony beats up amir and amir ends up with a scar above his lip just like his dear friend hassan who was born with cleftpallet oh the coincidence and the fact that amir even runs into assef again is ridiculous another example amir and his wife arent able to have children and of course they find an orphan boy who happens to be extended family and they adopt him what a coincidence and after amir returns to afghanistan he doesnt call home to his dutiful wife for over a month i kept wondering whens he gonna call home and any plot advanced by a series of tragedies and in this book they are legion shows little more than the writers inability to craft a meaningful and interesting plot not only is it pretty poor form its also highly manipulative and condescending i found myself continually frustrated by hosseinis apparent distrust of the reader we dont have to be told how and when to interpret metaphors and if i read one more book where the protagonist is a writer or professor im gonna ram my head into a metal post  i dont want to sound like a misanthrope or jaded literature reader because im certainly not this novel just left me wanting so much more in terms of plot and characterization having said that however the novel could be important in that shows the cruelty of the taliban much of what hosseini writes about is important especially for us westerners unfamiliar with the breadth and scope of the afghani tragedy  i found this book a failure of courage and imagination  all the more upsetting for the authors astute sense of detail and wonderful psychological depth but ask yourself this if the taliban are real humans than why are they not represented as such no doubt we will all love the movie as well  if you want to read a book on afghanistan i recommend jason elliots an unexpected light  below is my complete review  i started out loving this book hosseini is dead on target in his depiction of childrens psychology the noncontractual relationships between master and servant and in his weaving of the threads between trauma memory and denial  further hosseini captures the feel of life in a third world country his depiction of afghanistan confirms my own short travels in afghanistan during the s indeed i was becoming ever more excited with the possibility of teaching this book in my new course on afghanistan but alas  the book fails exactly where it most needs to succeed  in the depiction of the taliban when we do not have an archive or the possibility of getting at the facts and narratives of a part of history fiction can be used creatively and responsibly in order to construct something real take for example the extraordinary slave narrative written by guy endore  babouk after years of research endore writes a history of a slave engaged in rebellion just prior to the haitian revolution  hosseini has the skills but not the courage nor the empathysympathy to portray the taliban as historical sociological economic modern creations discounting and trivializing his own skills he characterizes the taliban in the easiest way  as simple cartoonish evil he thereby does nothing to enlighten us worse he panders to a sleepwalking liberal public who happily accept his vision as a seemingly authentic reflection of their own myopia  most everyone is satisfied the us public for having read about a country they destroyed  feeling all the better at having disposed of evil the publishers for their timely profit and hosseini for having expressed his romantic sense of loss  at least vs niapaul is honest about his hatred for his own people hosseinis twist is less forgivable  he gives aide to the very people whose malice neglect ignorance and misunderstanding of afghan people is one key factor in the destruction of this beautiful land and vital people  a failure of imagination is often the result of a failure in will in courage in politics hosseini traps himself in the politics of nostalgia i must admit that although i had heard plenty of people mention the kite runner i hadnt actually paid much attention to what was said about it other than it was wonderful  so a few days ago and several years after the book came out i heard a couple of people discussing the wonderful book i decided to read it  the first day i read about a third of the novel hassan is raped amir feels bad well sort of he feels bad that hassan is raped yes but even worse because hassans rape makes him feel bad and of course this means he needs to act badly and do bad things and make more bad stuff happen to hassan who is not bad at all and i will admit that this portion of the book had me reading as quickly as i could i flipped from one page to the next skimmed over the plethora of annoyances oops i mean i skimmed over the farsi vocab sprinkled evenly throughout to of course add authenticity and give it that multicultural feel that is sure to make every publisher drool over a manuscript and i was even forgiving of the somewhat poor writing yes on day one i liked the kite runner i was into the kite runner and when i decided to continue my read the next day  i had high hopes  the second day i read to the point where amir gets a phone call from a man he has not seen in years abandons his perfect life in america well almost perfect there is the infertility and the gap that his wifes uterus is forming between them but their sex life is still good  sometimes what never mind so anyway amir hops on a plane to afghanistan which is being ruled by the taliban yet he enters without issue and follows the yellow brick road and lands at oz where it turns out that the man behind the glasses is not john lennon at all  he is assef  his childhood nemesis pedophile and just plain evil guy and you know he is evil cause he likes hitler  although he has never heard of ethic cleansing so amir walks right into the taliban compound and asks to see the wizard i mean their leader and is allowed to do so actually it was more difficult for dorothy to get in to see the wizard she should have taken amir with her and when he gets in we find out that hassans son is made to dress like a monkey  get it a monkey  ya know like the monkey that amir and hassan would go see too bad it wasnt a flying monkey  and provide entertainment for the taliban and provide sexual services for assef  the same guy who had sex with hassan and now the obviously simple minded reader that hosseini wrote for says that is so weird the way that all happened wow i cant believe the way this is all coming together this is sooooooo fascinating oh and for the thinking reader with any literary competence who may think that this is too much of a coincidence dont be so critical this issue was already addressed when amir ran into a beggar who happened to have taught with and remembered doing so amirs mother we the readers are clearly told that coincidence is very common in afghanistan therefore if the rest of the story seems too contrived dont worry it is realistic for afghanistan so dont question it cause he is the expert on afghanistan and you the reader are not therefore just accept that this completely ridiculous unrealistic obviously contrived series of events are very realistic in afghanistan  my third day of reading i completed the book and instead of placing my hand over my heart smiling and thinking about how wonderful the book was how beautiful the story was and how it all came so nicely together in the end apparently the reaction of the masses i was mad i was mad because there are so many people out there who think a book this ridiculous and obvious is brilliant i was mad because this is precisely what is wrong with some multicultural literature and what gives multicultural literature a bad name there are many pieces out there that are actually beautifully written provide valuable insight into other cultures and entertain the reader ie reading lolita in tehran however it does nothing for multicultural literature to publish pieces that are poorly written and filled with clich i can forgive to a certain extent poorer writing when the story is written as a true account and when the purpose of the novel is to retell actual events however when an author decides he is going to write a piece of fiction his style diction and plotline come into question the final portion of the novel continues throwing out one clich after another and throws out one ridiculous coincidence after another just the fact that a good portion of the middle of the book was dedicated to pounding it into the readers head that amir and soraya could not have children and did not want to adopt well that is unless the bloodline is known is enough to clue the reader in that they will adopt sohrab waaaay before amir even knows that he will adopt sohrab what a coincidence that hassan just happened to be his half brother happened to have a son and the son happened to have been taken by assef and it was even more convenient that even from the grave once again hassan could save amir he could provide him with a son and the opportunity to finally fight the big bully who still carried his brass knuckles and more convenient yet the fact that sohrab always carried that slingshot and in case we forgot that he always carried it amir remembered for us as if hosseini wants to say see readers how clever i am i set it up that sohrab always had the slingshot and now later in the story it comes back out see how clever i am readers everything in my story has a purpose and is connected however what hosseini needed to do is explain how a kid who has been taken from an orphanage made to dress and entertain like a monkey lives with the taliban and is a sex slave for the big bad assef still managed to keep his slingshot  the very weapon used against assef in the past and the very weapon that assef has an issue with just how dumb must a reader be to believe that the freakin taliban never noticed so okay sohrab saves amir they escape and the taliban does nothing and then another freaking coincidence  amir will end up with a scar and in case the reader does not deduce that amir will have a scar from his busted lip the doctor points it out and confirms it yes reader a scar like hassans  get it its connected  get it  truth be told there are so many unbelievable incidents and ridiculous coincidences presented to us in this book that it would take pages to go through them all because they were present from beginning to end the young russian soldier who doesnt shoot baba and the older russian soldier who apologizes for him and talks about the young soldiers  yeah right the fact that amir is an author who is published right away and cranks out novel after novel with great success  yeah right baba dies of lung cancer and then rahim khan seems to have to same issue  does hosseini think all people who die of natural causes die of lung issues raymond andrews who has a bad attitude because his kid committed suicide and then the receptionist actually tells amir that this happened  the way this came out seemed completely fake and contrived because  it wouldnt happen then of course sohrab tries to kill himself so now we know why andrews kid had to commit suicide  we needed one more obvious instance of foreshadowing it is also a little odd how often amir throws out how he knows about medicine because he is a writer  what i didnt know i needed to seek out an author when i was sick and so on and so on  but one final point that i would like to make is that as soon as amir picked up a kite it seemed that much like jesus his hands began to bleed therefore i am left to wonder why didnt amir know about the invent of gloves perhaps that is the biggest tragedy of it all  by the way i am still giving the novel two stars because there is an interesting story in there and the glimpse into afghanistan is valuable it is just that the author did such a poor job of presenting the story that it actually detracts from the positive aspects of the book and makes the validity of his glimpse into afghanistan quite questionable therefore my two stars are for the possibilities that could have been if it had been written by a talented author because the kite runner is adored by approximately  of those who have read it i decided to read the thing myself after thousands of enthusiastic reviews i had pretty high expectations which the book ultimately did not meet  the kite runner is a pretty simple story how one event can change a whole life  sort of stuff ian mcewan specialises in hosseini is big in foreshadowing  he certainly wont let you forget that a terrible event is going to happen on that day of that year but before going to take you to the mentioned event hell spend some pages of describing afghan culture i quite enjoyed that then go back to mentioning that gloomy day and switch back to describing how tasty naan was when our heroes were kids  speaking of which the book deals with two young boys  amir and hassan amir is a well to do pashtun boy while hassan is his servant one of the hazara despite being breastfeeded by the same nanny both boys occupy drastically different social positions  speaking simply amir is the master and hassan is the slave theyre quite close though  they play together and compete in kite flying where hassan excels at the titular kite running  catching kites that were cut down by other players hosseini a beginning writer did what most beginning writers do unfortunately  made the boys complete polar opposites of each other amir is one of the most unsympathetic protagonists i ever encountered in fiction  and he stays that way through the whole book which im not sure was hosseinis intention  while hassan is basically a saint who also happens to be pretty good at ironing cleaning and cooking  its difficult to discuss the plot of the novel without giving something away but i think its safe to say that the relationship between two boys is doomed to be destroyed by the terrible event which the author surely emphasized often enough before the book has the chance to turn into deliverance with kites a chain of events happens that forces hassan out of amirs household and amir out of his country here hosseini makes another of the mistakes made by beginning novelists  after putting his character through personal hell he makes his new life way to easy i find it funny because amir is an aspiring novelist and there are pages devoted to writing stories and the use of cliches  speaking of cliches the language is not that original either none of the sentences are groundbreaking or jawdropping and hosseinis use of farsi is irritating  he injects the words from his native language just to make the book sound smart i can inject words from my native language ale to nic nie zmieni bo wci bdzie to ten sam tekst do you know what it means hosseini apparently thinks we all understand him easily and can pick up the connotations from context from my experience people dont switch back and forth between two languages when they speak to a person who knows only one and most certainly they dont start a sentence in english put in one or two words in farsi explain them in english and then finish the sentence in english againand expect us to understand theyve been speaking farsi to begin with i didnt read this book to learn farsi but id appreciate learning what some of the words mean and how they are important in the afghan culture and relate to the protagonists lives i certainly wouldnt like to learn this the hosseini way who crams these words not two or three times per page but five or six per paragraph which gets old and confusing pretty soon its especially evident in the parts where amirs father tries to speak english but does that poorly without proper grammar and words while in the next paragraph hes referring to amir in a way of a proper englishman the reader is supposed to understand that father and son are speaking in their native language but the transition between the two is never suggested in any way there are no italics or quotation marks  another important part of the novel are plot holes amir learns about them from hassan of all people who points out a glaring one in the story our hero has written while the first part of the novel is relatively free of them the second one is one big plot hole full of implausible plot developments that are overtly coincidental and very contrived as mentioned amir is an aspiring novelist hes very quick to get back on his feet again and publish four books in quick succesion embark on reading tours without any sort of struggle or difficultyand to top that marry a beautiful young girl what follows is a plot from some tv melodrama with impossible consequences  a street bum whom amir meets is a university professor who knew his mother amir cant have children so theres a child to save and most of all the evil bad guy who shows up is pretty much one of the worst bad guys of all time  hosseini really outdid himself here and made him not only a sadist and a pedophile but also a nazi the biggest and most important plot points involving emigration which is quite an obstacle is solved by one phone call  you know amir i just happen to have this uncle who seriously hosseini got so wound up in the tragedies he made up for his character that he decided to get them out from the situation by the easiest of ways  cheating  im not saying that the events hosseini writes about are not important not that the story he aims to deliver is bland  there are twists that i didnt predict its just that it lacks so much in characteriation and plot development depends too hard on cliches and deus ex machinas it didnt made my heart soar as some said it would certainly its not the best book i have ever read maybe because hosseini tries too hard to manipulate emotions of the reader and his attempts at metpahor and foreshadowing are hamfisted at best he concentrates on one theme while ignoring others that are just as interesting and the kite runner never even suggest an answer to the most important question  why werent they wearing gloves this book was very powerful very disturbing at times and now i see why khaled hosseini is sometimes on lists for school reading because this has a lot of great themes and nuggets of deep underlying meaning in it this book was both tragic and uplifting and it made me feel a range of emotions frustrated to touched however i felt really disconnected from the setting i was really interested in reading about afghanistan but i never felt immersed in that worl
"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",lowrys book is a piece of nationalist propaganda using oversimplification emotional appeals and dualistic morality to shut down her readers minds more troubling is that it is aimed at children who dont yet have the critical faculties to defend themselves from such underhanded methods  unsurprisingly lowry adopts the structure of the monomyth equating a spiritual journey with a moral one her christfigure uses literal magic powers to rebel against his society this rebellion and the morality behind it are presented as natural to contrast with the abnormal morality around him  lowry doesnt seem to understand that we get our morality from our culture it isnt something inborn that we lose this is the first hint of lowrys misunderstanding of the human mind she assumes her own morality is correct and then builds her story to fit it  she also makes the character act and think like a modern person would despite never adequately explaining how he came up with such unusual notions its the same trick many historical fiction authors use leaving us scratching our heads as to why a fourteenth century french peasant speaks like a secondwave feminist id suggest that lowry falls to this fault for the same reason they do she has no talent for imagining how others might think differently  lowrys book ends with the standard nonspecific transgressive spiritual event that marks any overblown monomyth since the book is not a progressive presentation of ideas it does not suggest any conclusion instead the climax is a symbolic fauxdeath event symbolic of what none can say confusingly lowry later redacts the ending in the sequels undermining the pseudospiritual journey she created  though some call this book dystopian its closer to the truth to say lowry borrows elements from the dystopian authors attempting to combine the spiritual uplift of the monomyth with the political and social deconstruction of the dystopia what she doesnt recognize is that the faith of the one conflicts with the cynicism of the other she draws on ideas and images from many other authors bradbury huxley orwell burgess but doesnt improve upon them  these authors created novels that reflected the world around them they based them on the political events of the times presented with realism and careful psychology though they presented the struggle between the individual and the society they portrayed morality as grey and suffering as the result of individual human faults not political systems lowry doesnt realize that the best way to critique fascism or communism is not to present it as evil but to simply present it as it was  but lowrys world is not based in reality it is symbolic and hyperbolic instead of writing about how poverty makes the world seem small and dull she has the characters magically unable to experience life instead of an impersonal government she presents a sort of evil hippy commune  the only political system it resembles is a school which is a neat little trick to get the kids interested the idea that schoolunfeeling totalitarian hell is not an uncommon one but its one im surprised teachers would support the book also suggests a creche but lacking similarity to any realworld system it doesnt work as a political criticism  lowry creates this artificial world to suit her purposes but it is not a symbolic exercise like animal farm we understand that the pigs of animal farm are symbolic because there are no talking pigs lowrys world is more insidious since its oversimplification is hidden she builds an artificial world to support the dualist morality that shes pushing she presents the same kneejerk fears about euthanasia and abortion that people use against womens rights or health care  worse than these straw man arguments is the fact that she never deals with the economic causes of totalitarianism tyrants dont just rise up and take control by their own force of will they come into power because of the socioeconomic situations that surround them lean times produce strong fascist leaders while profitable times produce permissive liberal societies  strong centralized leadership simply doesnt selfpropagate in cultures where everyone is clothed fed and housed the holocaust was socially about some ideal of change and purity but it was economically about the transmission of wealth from jews poles and catholics to germans and more specifically to those germans who had elected the new ruling party  the atrocities of war are for the most part committed by normal people on other normal people by presenting the power structure as amoral and inhuman lowry ignores the fact that people will willingly cause others to suffer painting the enemy as evil and alien is just an unsophisticated propagandist method  she contrasts her evil with the idealized goodness of emotion beauty and freedom this is nothing more than the american dream of specialness that mr rogers was pushing for so many years we are all special we are all good we all deserve love and happiness sure it sounds good but what does it mean  where does this specialness come from if it is just the sanctity of human life then its not really special because its allencompassing if all of us are special then none of us are theres nothing wrong with valuing life but when lowry presents one mode of life as valuable and another as reprehensible she ceases to actually value humanity as a whole instead she values a small idealized chunk of humanity people are good except the ones i dont like is not a moral basis nor is it a good message to send to kids  if the specialness is only based on fitting in with a certain moral and social guideline then lowry isnt praising individuality shes praising herd behavior the protagonist is only special because he has magic powers his specialness is not a part of his character it is an emotional appeal  the idea of being a special individual is another piece of propaganda and its one kids are especially prone to because kids arent special they are carefully controlled and powerless giving a character special powers and abilities and then using that character to feed a party line to children is not merely disingenuous its disturbing  there is also a darker side to universal specialness giving a child a sense of importance without anything to back it up creates egotism and instability adults noticed that children with skills and friends had high selfesteems but instead of teaching their children social skills and knowledge they misunderstood the causal relationship and tried to give them selfworth first  unfortunately the moment unsupported selfworth is challenged the child finds they have nothing to fall back on their entitlement didnt come from their skills or experiences and so they have nothing to bolster that sense of worth instead any doubt sends them down a spiral of emotional instability  a single book like this wouldnt be the cause of such a state in a child but it does act as part of the social structure built to give a sense of worth without a solid base for that worth people like to believe they are special kids especially so but being a remarkable person is not a result of belief but of actions if the book had informed them then it would leave them better off but giving them a conclusion based on emotional appeals does nothing to build confidence or character  many people have told me this book is good because it appeals to children but children often fall for propaganda children develop deep relationships with pop stars breakfast cereals and japanese monsters this does not make them good role models for children  feeding specialness to kids along with a political message is no better than the fascist youth programs lowry intends to criticize the obsession with individuality is just another form of elitism its ironic that people in america most often describe themselves as individuals when pointing out the things they do to align themselves with groups  but banding together in a community is not a bad thing for lowry and other red scare children any mention of communal can turn into a witch hunt but we all give up some personal rights and some individuality in order to live in relatively safe structured societies there are benefits to governmental social controls and there are drawbacks and its up to us to walk the line between the two anarchy and totalitarianism never actually exist for long we are social animals  its not difficult to understand why lowry is so popular especially amongst educators the message she gives aligns perfectly with what they were taught as kids from red scare reactionism to the hippydippy unique snowflake mantra these ideas arent entirely misguided either its good to recognize the benefits of difference and the dangers of allowing other to control our lives  if a reader believes that fascism and socialism are inherently wrong and that their own individuality is their greatest asset they will likely sympathize with lowrys work however this doesnt make the book honest nor beneficial one of the hardest things we can do as readers is disagree with the methods of authors we agree with ideologically  it makes us feel good to find authors who agree with us but this is when we should be at our most skeptical searching the world for selfjustification is not a worthwhile goal it simply turns you into another shortsighted argumentative knowitall yes men never progress  lowry is toeing the party line she does not base her book around difficult questions like the dystopian authors but around easy answers she doesnt force the reader to decide for themselves what is best she makes it clear what she wants us to think her book is didactic which means that it instructs the reader what to believe  even if her conclusions about individuality vs community are correct she doesnt present arguments she only presents conclusions like rote memorization or indoctrination she teaches nothing about the politics social order economics or psychology of totalitarianism or individuality the reader is not left with an understanding just an opinion  the baseless individuality of the book lets the reader imagine that they are rebelsthat they are bucking the system even as they fall into lockstep by letting the reader think they are already freethinking lowry tricks them into forgetting their skepticism  she is happy to paint a simple world of black and white and this is likely the world she sees i doubt she is purposefully creating an insidious text she just cant see past her own opinions she writes this book with a point to make and makes it using emotional appeals and symbolism she doesnt back it up with arguments because she doesnt seem to have developed her opinions from cogent arguments  in the end she doesnt show us that the structure of this society is wrong she says nothing poignant about individuality vs community instead she relies on threats to the life of an innocent infant yet nowhere does she provide an argument for why communal living or the sacrifice of freedoms for safety must necessarily lead to infanticide  in politics making extreme claims about the opposing side is called mudslinging it is an underhanded and dishonest tactic it works arguing intelligently is difficult accusing is easy so thats what lowry does  she is another child of wwii and the cold war who hasnt learned her lesson she quickly condemns the flaws of others while failing to search out her own even after the holocaust there are many racist nationalist violent jews conflict rarely breeds a new understanding  america condemned the faceless communal life of the second world and yet america created the projects we critiqued strong governmental controls but we still have the bank bailout socialized medicine socialized schooling and socialized charity america condemned the gulags and work camps and yet we imprison one out of every hundred citizens far more than stalin ever did some are killed all are dehumanized  as a little sci fi adventure the book isnt terrible its really the pretension that goes along with it lowry cobbles together religious symbolism and dystopic tropes and then tries to present it as something as complex and thoughtful as the authors she copied copying isnt a crime but copying poorly is  like dan brown or michael crichton she creates a political pamphlet of her own ideals slaps a pretense of authority on it and then waits for the money and awards to roll inand they did many people ive discussed this book with have pointed to those awards as the surest sign of this books eminent worth  award committees are bureaucratic organizations their decisions are based on political machinations this book is a little piece of nationalism and so it was lauded by the political machine that lowry supports the left hand helps the right if awards are the surest sign of worth then titanic is a better movie than citizen kane  what surprises me is how many of those who brought up the award as their argument were teachers if a politicallycharged administrative committee is the best way to teach children then why do you take umbrage when the principal tells you that bigger class sizes and fewer benefits are fine listen to him doesnt he have award plaques  the other argument is usually that kids like it i usually respond that kids also like candy so why not teach that some people also get angry at me for analyzing a book written for children  of course its not a great book its for kids if you want a good book go read ulysses  i prefer to give children good books rather than pieces of political propaganda even if they agreed with me children can be as skeptical quickwitted and thoughtful as adults if you give them the chance so i see no excuse for feeding them anything less  kids arent stupid they just lack knowledge and thats a fine distinction its easy for adults to take advantage of their naivete their emotionality and their sense of worth just because its easier for the teacher doesnt mean its better for the child  when we show children something that is oversimplified presenting an idealized crudely moralizing world we arent preparing them for the actual world if you give a child a meaningless answer to repeat he will repeat it but he wont understand why  why not give the child a book that presents many complex ideas but no rote answers and let them make up their own minds if they dont learn how to separate the wheat from the chaff and form their own opinions early in a safe nurturing environment what chance will they have on their own as adults  in all the discussions and research regarding this book i have come across very little analysis its especially surprising for a book with such a strong following but there arent many explanations of why the book is supposed to be useful or important  this lack of argument makes sense from a political standpoint since there is no reason to analyze the worth of propaganda its worth is that it agrees with society and indoctrinates readers analyzing it would defeat the purpose political diatribes do not stand up to thoughtful attention  perhaps someday someone will create a thoughtful textual analysis of this book that will point out its merits its structure and its complexity ive gradually come to doubt it i never expected when i wrote my original review of this book that it would garner this much attention  i still welcome comments and thoughts but if your comment looks roughly like this  you should read this book again but this time like it more you think youre smart but you arent youre mean lowry is great this book won awards and kids like it its meant for kids anyways why would you analyze what its about i bet you never even read the sequels go read moby dick because you are full of yourself  ive heard that one before if you do want to comment though you might check out this article i find it helps me with presenting my ideas i think im missing something everyone loves this book and i liked it too but it wasnt amazing or anything  the giver felt like a very sparse story to me first there isnt much characterization so i didnt form an emotional connection with any of the characters  not even with jonas or the giver two central characters asher and fiona particularly fiona are introduced such that you assume they will play greater roles in the book than they do i dont feel like i knew mom or dad or lily at all while the lack of an emotional bond with these lesser characters may be due to the nature of their community jonas and the giver should really be more sympathetic in my opinion  second the description of the community itself is sparse there is so much more that couldve been described about this utopian community i feel like jonas selection his revelation about release and his eventual choice couldve been built up and framed better i feel like i got the quick campfire version  finally while i appreciate its overall message about the importance of individual differences human emotion etc i felt like the book was a bit heavyhanded with its moral jonas initial support of his community and gradual change of heart seems intended to present both viewpoints but doesnt succeed in my opinion the books agenda was clear to me from the beginning it also doesnt present alternative possibilities such as a world without sameness but also without war a world without release but also without starvation etc  the choice is either here with sameness and no color or elsewhere with pain and suffering  when teaching the book i also felt it was very important for students to understand how this heavyhanded moral that most of us would agree with somewhat demonstrates lowrys and our own privilege that is the reason its easy for us to say that jonas community is horrible is because of our own relatively privileged lives if we lived in darfur were extremely impoverished lived in a country where women were treated as property etc we may make a very different choice about jonas life  despite all of this believe it or not i did like the giver its an enjoyable read it had a great plot the community was interesting and the ending was fantastic and just a little ambiguous  cool if there are no wrong answers can we really say that something has any meaning  it is very easy to start an interesting science fiction story simply begin with a mystery dont explain things to the reader and leave them in a state of wonder in this way everything will seem interesting intriguing and worth exploring tap into the readers powers of imagination and allow them to make your story interesting in ways you need not imagine and perhaps cannot create this is a good plan for starting a science fiction story lots of science fiction stories begin in this way on television almost all of them do  xfiles lost battlestar galactica the  the truth is out there they have a plan  the giver starts in this way in the first few pages as the setting unfolded i was struck by the parallels to china after the cultural revolution  the bicycles the uniformlike clothing the regulated life the shame based culture and the sameness i also thought of china because i immediately grasped that this had to be a culture which was designed to gently crash its population there were many clues that the world was heavily overpopulated and the primary goal of the culture so described was to crash the population without descending into society destroying anarchy  the highly regulated birthrate which was insufficient to sustain the population to sustain the population more than  out of each  females would have to be assigned to be birth mothers and this clearly wasnt the case the replacement rate for a society is about  live births per female maybe  in a society that is safe and careful  clearly they were implied to be below this ratio so clearly this was a society that was trying to shed population  equally clearly this was a society that engaged in widespread euthanasia for the most trivial of causes which hints at a culture which doesnt value life because people are in such abundance that they can be readily disposed of i suspected that release was euthanasia almost immediately from the context in which it was introduced and this was almost immediately confirmed when it was revealed that infants were subject to release clearly infants cant be meaningfully banished so clearly release was euthanasia so i was intrigued by the story i wanted to see what happened to jonas and his naive family who had so poised themselves on the edge of a great family wrecking tragedy in just the first few dozen pages of the story i wanted to receive from the storyteller answers to the questions that the story was poising if not some great profound message then at least some story that followed from what she began  but it was not to be the first clue that the whole construct was to eventually come crashing down was that jonas clearly didnt understand release to mean euthanasia nor in fact did anyone seem to know what release meant this shocked me because in the context of the setting it was virtually impossible that he and everyone else did not know i could very easily imagine a stable society where human life was not prized  after all societies that believe that human life is intrinsically valuable are historically far less common than ones that dont we know that the society is life affirming both because we are told how pained and shocked they are by loss and by the fact that jonas responds to scenes of death with pity and anger what i could not believe in was a society which held the concept of precision of language so tightly and so centrally that the protagonist could not imagine lying could in fact be founded on lies thats impossible no society like that can long endure some technological explanation would be required to explain how the society managed to hide the truth from itself if release took place in some conscious state of mind then surely the dispensers of justice the nurturers the caregivers and the sanitation workers would all know the lie and all suspect  as jonas did  that they were being lied to as well surely all of these would suspect what their own future release would actually entail and surely at least some of them would reject it surely some not inconsequential number of new children reared to value precision of language and to affirm the value of life would rebel at the audacity of the lie if nothing else even in a society that knew nothing of love even if only the society had as much feeling as the members of the family displayed and even if people only valued others as much as the community was shown to value others surely some level of attachment would exist between people soma or not the seeds of pain tragedy conflict and rebellion are present if ever the truth is known to anyone  nothing about the story makes any sense none of it bears any amount of scrutiny at all the more seriously you consider it the more stupid and illogical the whole thing becomes we are given to believe that the society has no conception of warfare to the point that it cannot recognize a childs war game for what it is and yet we are also given to believe that they train pilots in flying what is implied to be a fighter craft and that the community maintains antiaircraft weapons on a state of high alert such that they could shoot down such a fighter craft on a moments notice we are given to believe that all wild animals are unknown to the community yet we are also given to believe that potential pest species like squirrels and birds are not in fact extinct how do you possibly keep them out of the community if they exist in any numbers elsewhere we are given to believe that technology exists sufficient to fill in the oceans and control the weather and replace the natural biosphere with something capable of sustaining humanity but that technological innovation continues in primitive culture we are given to believe that they are worried about overpopulation and starvation and yet also that most of the world is empty and uninhabited or that this inherently xenophobic community lives in isolation if in fact it doesnt span the whole of the earth we are given to believe that this is a fully industrial society yet the community at most has a few thousands of people surely thousands of such communities must exist to maintain an aerospace industry to say nothing of weather controllers why is no thought given to the hundreds of other receivers of memory which must exist in their own small circles of communities in the larger community surely any plan which ignores the small communities place in the larger is foredoomed to failure surely the receiver of memory knows what a purge or a pogrom is  how are we to believe that jonass father whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks breaking the rules for his sake whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he risks face by going to the committee to plead for gabriels life whose compassion for little gabriel is so great that he discomforts himself and his whole family for a year for the sake of the child is the same man who so easily abandons that same child at a single setback when he has witnessed the child grow and prosper doesnt it seem far easier to believe that this same man who is openly scornful of the skills and nurturing ability of the night crew would more readily blame the night crew for gabriels discomfort i can only conclude just as i can only conclude about the illogical fact that no one knows what release is that everything is plastic within the dictates of the plot jonass father feels and acts one way when the needs of the plot require it and feels and acts in different ways when the needs of the plot require something else what i cant believe is that this is any sort of whole and internally consistent character or setting every single thing when held up to the light falls apart there is not one page which is even as substantial as tissue paper  it is almost impossible to draw meaning from nonsense so it is no wonder that people have wondered at the ending what happens the great virtue of the story as far as modern educators are probably concerned is that there are no wrong answers what ever you wish to imagine is true is every bit as good of answer as any other perhaps he lives perhaps he finds a community which lives in the old ways knowing choice  and war and conflict which probably explains why the community needs antiaircraft defenses but more likely from the context he dies perhaps he is delusional perhaps he gets to the bottom and lies down in the deepening snow which the runners can no longer be pushed through and he dies perhaps he dies and goes to heaven maybe even the heaven of the one whose birthday is celebrated by the implied holiday perhaps it is even the case that he was sent to his death by the cynical giver who knew his death was necessary to release the memories he contained by to the community perhaps he didnt just die but was slaughtered as the sacrificial lamb  killed by a murderous lie from the one he trusted too well for my entry in the meaningless answers contest i propose that the whole thing was just a dream this seems the easiest way to explain the contradictions a dream doesnt have to make sense and the biggest clue that it is a dream is of course that jonas sees the world in black and white with only the occasional flashes of recognized color around important colorful things as is typical of that sort of black and white dream perhaps jonas will wake up and engage in dream sharing with his family and they will laugh at the silliness and then go to the ceremony of twelves or perhaps the whole community is only a dream and jonas will wake up and go downstairs and open his christmas presents with his family whoa  why  really  so first off i would like to say that i really really really wanted to like this book since many human beings read and love this book and many have considered this as one of their favorite books of all time and before i posted my rating i browse the ratings of other gr members so that i know that im not the only abnormal human being who doesnt think that this book is good or great or whatever  coughs sorry i forgot to turn off the capslock im not shouting or anything coughs just please dont judge me coughs if you like the book i respect you for that but i really cant force myself into believing i like this book v  okay ill try to explain what i dont like about it  the book is boring  the book is weird  i dont feel any emotions at all towards the character  i dont really understand the book  i dont really understand the ending  i dont really understand why this utopia world should have no colors no feelings and no music so that the people would live coughs decently  i dont really understand why the children at age whatever should be given ribbons whats the purpose of that  i dont really understand why the characters should tell about their dreams to their parents  i dont understand why johnas has to take medications because he was having stirrings so stirrings for those who havent read the book is somewhat closer to wet dreams  i dont understand why the memories of war loss etc would make someone want to end hisher life or give up on life i know that life is imperfect but it seems that the characters have no backbone like idk i dont buy the logic of that one  in short i dont really understand this at all  if youre wondering whether ive read this one because its a school requirement the answer is no i buy this book because ive seen it on the list of best ya book here on goodreads so many times and if these book is bombarded with symbolism then please explain this to mesince i dont have brains for symbolism people especially the ending what the fudge is that and i might change my rating i repeat might as every newbery medal winner the giver is a very well written childrens book its deceptively simplistic language reveals a rather horrifying dystopian world this is a world where people are not given freedom to decide anything for themselves  their spouses children careers future even clothes or haircuts are all preplanned and preselected for them they are not allowed to even own their feelings and dreams their sexuality is suppressed of course it is done for common good  to preserve peace and serenity to avoid any disturbance be that war hunger overpopulation or simply personal discomfort of pain only two people in this community are able to understand what people miss out on the main character jonas is one of these people  the giver is a good book but   it is too young experiences of a year old are too simplistic and lack edge for my liking   in terms of dystopian setting i found a couple of lowrys aspects of the community hard to accept i believe that no matter how restrictive and oppressive a society is feelings of love and attachment to ones children or parents remain intact unlike in this book where family connections are very easily severed and forgotten secondly this story claims that people do not experience a feeling of love for instance because they dont have a memory of what it is imo feelings are not something we learn or recollect this is something that we experience involuntarily  in spite of my complaints i am interested in reading the sequels this is the part where im supposed to go ooh this book is such a terrifying wakeup call to the dark side of our views of paradise and even though we wish death and pain werent a part of our lives theyre necessary because without them we would be ignorant and lost and blah blah blah  so ooh this book is such a terrifying wakeup call to the dark side of our views of paradise and even though we wish death and pain werent a part of our lives theyre necessary because without them we would be ignorant and lost and blah blah blah  i get it ms lowry im sure everyone is right when they say this book is brilliant  for twelveyearolds etc buti just didnt like it plus the ending was kind of crap and i wish you wouldve explained a lot more about how that world was set up  ps if you really liked the giver and are getting really pissed off at me right now dont take it personally i was a very cynical twelve year old  read for th grade english i find it pretty much impossible to read ya books as an adult and leave the adult in me behind long enough to enjoy them there are those rare ones that are written on two levels a level at which the youth gets all they need and another in which the adult is also satisfied this book doesnt quite make that bar for me even though it addresses some important issues and would make a great choice if you were teaching a class filled with nine and ten year o
The Giving Tree,okay this some motherfuckin fuckedup shit right here the giving tree is the straightup wack story of how this selfish little assfaced prick kicks it with this fullon saintly tree everthin fine for a while yall with the lil prick all gettin up in there an sayin to the tree yeah you know you mah bitch but then all of a sudden this jumpedup prick go through puberty get his chia

tree fungus motherfucker the motherfuckin end motherfuckers  okay so thats not really the way the giving tree ends but maybe its the way it should some time ago my exgirlfriend and afterward longtime codependent friend gave me the giving tree as part of my birthday gift i loved it but i hated it too because i felt so bad for the tree who is endlessly shat upon by this worthless boyas he is always known regardless of age i longed to console the tree and maybe a little to condemn this book as yet another emotionallyscarring childrens entertainment in the manner of old yeller dont give me any shit about learning valuable lessons the only lesson i learned was that human beings are nothing but steaming piles of cornfreckled feces and that i wanted to found a notforprofit shelter for unloved trees and rabid dogs and any other nonhuman thing living or not which was either unwanted or despised  having said all this  and although i dont approve of the treatment of the giving tree  this book is very moving and very delicate the delicacy is somewhat counteracted when the reader turns over the book and sees the author photograph of a thoroughly evillooking shel silverstein he looks like the sort of person who would burn down whole forests of rare giving trees just for kicks picture othello just before he strangles desdemona  if you  and yes im talking to you personally  are not moved by the plight of the tree after reading this book then perhaps its time to go an check yoself are you the givin tree or are you the motherfuckin takin tree or are you the sneakoutinthemiddleofthenightanstealallmyshit tree i know that many people have a sentimental love for this book and i respect that  you cant rationalize emotional connection and generally i like this author but with this book since it inspired no real emotional response in me i am left with only the rational perspective which in me was this  this book troubles me deeply because it enshrines selfdestructive and selfpitying martyrdom as the paragon of love for others and i think there is already far too much of this in our society this book seems to say that if you really love someone else you will damage yourself cripple yourself tear down your boundaries destroy yourself for them and further it implies that those who are loved must by nature use and devour those who love them an incredibly unhealthy model for love and relationships especially for a childs book  i am a parent of two and though many parents have offered up this book as representative of the true nature of parental love i cannot agree if i were to raise my children this way i feel i would only be teaching them to take selfishly from those who love them to use people up and always expect more  and on the flip side i would be teaching them that if they love someone then they have to give of themselves until it hurts have to live without boundaries of any kind  instead of raising my kids this way i feel its important to teach them to respect those who love them and care for them to not take from others so much that it damages i feel its important to teach them that even in love we all must maintain our boundaries our integrity i feel its important that my kids and all kids really understand that real healthy love does not demand destruction or diminishment of anyone involved in it that in fact real and healthy love ultimately heals and builds up those who participate in it  i suppose that this book may have been intended as an antilesson an example of how not to behave  but if so then it was not made clear that this was the case because most people who read this book seem to take it as an ideal example of love  certainly its possible to not take it so seriously but when the underlying message and philosophy is so concentrated and heavyhanded its hard to avoid tasting it in every passage  it reminds me of that other beloved childhood book about love where the young boys mother is so obsessive about cuddling him and tucking him in at night that even as he gets older and older she follows him around sneaks into his college dorm sneaks into his home as an adult takes him from his bed with his wife still sleeping and reassures him herself that hell always be my baby shudder  overall sweet but to the point of being cloying and a disturbing message  codependent tree needs to set some fucking boundaries should be called the codependent tree  there is a boy and a tree the boy constantly asks the tree for things even as the boy grows old he never stops asking the tree for assistance he never does anything for the tree and the tree is happy  every time i read this book it gives me a queasy feeling it is a visceral reaction this book doesnt sit right with me why would anyone have to be a shell of themselves to make someone else happy why does a onedirectional relationship make the tree happy why does the boy think it is okay to keep asking of the tree when he never gives back why doesnt the boy mature as he gets older april   so it is christmas time and my wife likes to have all of usmy wife and i and our three years old twinsdo a different event each night during advent as a family i like this practice it is little things like this that keep our family strong tonights event was reading christmas themed books  we decided to read the giving tree as well as three other christmas books had i foreseen what was about to transpire i would have omitted the giving tree from my selection  allow me to replay said event  the setting mommy and daddys bed  after a torturous time of getting my kids to brush their teeth put on their pajamas and convinced that they should only bring two stuffed animals apiece to bed i began to read the books the first book went well the kids laughed my wife and i smiled the second book was just as good as the first book more laughter more smiles then it was time for the giving tree now ive read all of shel silversteins books i find them quite enjoyable and zany and creative  the giving tree was no different or so i thought you see i never really paid much attention to the story well thats not entirely true i have always liked the message about giving when others are constantly taking and christmas time is a perfect time to share this message  but my son noah interpreted the book differently  as i read the book i focused on how the little boy grows into a man and loses his innocence of giving taking on a more selfish attitude my son saw the boy growing older when the tree gave everything but its stump to the boy as a man i saw this as a generous message of charity noah saw it as the man killing the tree but thats not all  an excerpt of the night  me the end that was a good story  noah i didnt like it  me why the tree was very generous and the man realized that he had only taken and never given back  noah staring blankly at me as if i had just finished reading him my bank statement  me what didnt you like about the story  noah the boy grows old and kills the tree and is now going to die  me inwardly ssssshhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttt the death subject  me no honey the tree gave its branches and trunk to the man  noah the boy killed the tree and now the boy is old and is going to die me no buddy the tree just changed and the little boy lived a long life  noah and now he is going to die  me ffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk inwardly of course  so having no other way to combat my sons determination to prove that the tree was murdered and that the little boy was now an old man and was going to die soon i did what every father should do in this matter  me ask mommy what she thinks buddy horrific relationship between a selfish unappreciative child and an enabling selfsacrificing mother who has no purpose in life other than to give herself away i keep expecting a missing page to show up where he pisses all over the tree stump at the end  i think this is offensive and despicable  it is a horrible lesson for children id rather see more literature that honors and respects the sacrifices that parents make rather than this books actual focus demonstrating the expectations that this black hole of a child has  i feel that sacrifice without a concept of self gives less weight to the sacrifice  this could be rewritten with a hungry boy eagerly gnawing on the scraps that his mother is cutting off from her body my yearold daughter had this read to her in preschool and burst into uncontrollable sobs at the end its not fair the tree is dead and the little boy was so mean to it  exactly honey this book reeks of the patriarchy keep it away from your kidsespecially your daughters i try to steal books written for children since i am no giving tree and i am not paying for what my child reads but this book each time i read this at the bookshop itself i thrust it back to the place from where i took it angrily if i may add this book does not deserve to be stolen  what makes me angry each time i read this story all i want to do is to insert my hand in bookcover catch that falling fruit and saw the tree and take it home and make bat for my child a foot that my bed is missing currently balanced on bricks and add an extra plank to my bed so that i can lay with my legs spread a little more after being fully relaxed then yes then i would eat that tasty fruit and thus making sure that miniature cutelooking neverhappy pieceofshit gets nothing but seriously speaking this does not mean i was not serious before the tree which reduced itself to a stump repeatedly asked the boy to sit under her shade and play with her but all that mattered to that boy were his needs indeed the tree fulfilled all his needs by giving all she had and not once that boy was thankful to her  i dont think this story signifies parent and child relationship this boy all he shared was his problems but what about those moments when he enjoyed his life in reality obviously we tell our problems to our parents and they do eventually help us get rid of it but it is also those moments of happiness that we share with them happiness gets double when shared with the right person parents do grow along with the child unlike the tree which diminished itself to make child happy but never ever saw him happy and smiling this story is often read by parents to their child but what if it makes them feel miserable and guilty thinking that their parents are like the giving tree and they dont give anything in return how can anyone read this book to a child  i told the story to my mother and asked about her thoughts  first of all she recites a verse in sanskrit and translates to me as a tree never eats its own fruit and a river never drinks its own water further she explains it that they tree river and in general nature exist not for themselves but for others i think to myself that it is also we people certainly not everyone who are there to protect and conserve them as our token of mutual love as i am writing this review a song plays faintly in my mind sweet dreams are made of these who am i to disagree travel the world and the seven seas everybodys looking for something some of them want to use you some of them want to get used by you some of them want to abuse you some of them want to be abused sweet dreams are made of these who am i to disagree i am utterly confused what this story is about and what message mr silverstein was trying to conveybut what i know for sure is that marilyn manson rocks easily the most vile childrens book ever written for reasons eloquently stated by about a zillion other posters here i remember my grandmother whom i disliked yeah some kids dont like their grandparents its true used to push this book on me as terribly deep and beautiful and something i should really think about and you wonder why i didnt like my grandmother my mother thought it was a piece of shit too anyway its a vomitous book always has been and im glad there are other people who think that it is when i was a kid it was held up as the ne plus ultra of depth and beauty in childrens literature god help us if thats true but luckily it isnt if you want a proper story about selfsacrifice that wont make you want to go out and take a poleax to every tree within a fivemile radius try the fire cat i cant stand this book someone gave it to my children as a gift and im very close to hiding it or giving it away so that i dont have to read it to them at bedtime anymore the selfish uncaring boy who takes and takes and takes from the tree until the tree literally has nothing more to give just makes me want to reach through the pages and throttle him whats the message here is it when someone loves you its okay to just take advantage of them endlessly because they will always be there for you anyway or perhaps if you love someone just give them everything you have and expect nothing in return ever  i always want to cry for the lonely stump of a tree at the end she was a good tree she deserved more than the ungrateful brat who took away all of her apples and branches and trunk the book is impossible to wrap my mind around part of me wishes it ended thusly the tree suggests the boy chop her down to make a boat he takes her advice and the tree falls on him killing them both the moral being a quote ive heard attributed to bill cosby if you spend your whole life trying to make other people happy youll never be happy the boy is punished for all but raping the one who cares more for him than anyone in the world and the tree pays the ultimate price for a lifetime of allowing herself to be a doormat or alternately finally gets her revenge  who knows what silverstein was trying to get across with this alternately touching and troubling parable an exgirlfriend of mine gave this book to me as a present early in the relationship what was she trying to get across i cant give anything as tangibly mindboggling as the giving tree an entirely negative review and as always the art is cute and affecting and who can say maybe the guy just wanted to tell a little story about a nice tree foremost among silversteins many gifts apart from the more obvious talents of humor and rhyming were pathos and irreverence in the case of the giving tree for this reader anyway its very difficult to determine which of those traits is rearing its head here  bottom line its not a good present for your significant other this book makes me really sad this is my worst favorite childrens book ever i normally love shel silverstein  however this boy is just a complete and utter brat and uses up everything the tree has to give and the tree is completely codependent  the tree should have rained apples on this boys head and spanked him with her branches until he learned some respect  this is a story of a very bad boy i find this book disturbing and ive never liked it much ok theres being needy  taking and theres generosity  sacrifice all of which are human and fine but martyrdom and being completely selfish theres nothing healthy about that for anyone i dont care how deep this book supposedly is or what message its supposed to have i dont think its about friendship or unconditional love at all i would not give it or read it to any kidperson i know i know many disagree with me and ive heardread a lot of their positive opinions but i dont agree with those that are enamored by this book it does have some pretty pictures  i almost gave it  stars i rarely rate books with  star or even  stars and its certainly controversial and i like controversy and books that make for good discussion  but a really important fact there are so many much better books for kids out there this is a book that many goodreads friends love and many goodreads friends cant stand i was intrigued to see what i thought what a depressing story a boy and an apple tree are friends the boy grows up and takes more and more until theres nothing left the tree doesnt mind though it gives endlessly its only need is that the boy is happy i dont know what this is meant to be about if its about a mothers unconditional love for a child shes created a monster who only takes what are his relationships with others going to be like unconditional love doesnt mean wrecking your childs life if this is meant to be an environmental message it doesnt make sense either the tree kept inviting the boy to destroy it the illustrations werent nice poorly executed the tree doesnt look like an apple tree i asked my daughter what she thought of this she said what a horrible boy and poor tree i found this a sad and depressing story about only taking and not considering others feelings even as a tiny child i was depressed by this book  i hope it is not one of the artifacts aliens or future posthuman archaeologists use to judge our culture although it probably wouldnt misinform them mores the pity even as a tiny child i was depressed by this book  i hope it is not one of the artifacts aliens or future posthuman archaeologists use to judge our culture although it probably wouldnt misinform them mores the pity its both horrifying and depressing so i never read this as a kid and that probably has a significant impact on how i viewed this when i first read it i was in college and i thought it was beautiful sweet and loving then i read it to a child some years later remembering it fondly and i was horrified  the entire story is about one entity giving and giving and the other taking and taking not caring one iota about the relationship between the them cutting it down and the other allowing the sacrificeit illustrated the most abusive and unhealthy relationship as a childs story by the end i felt like a terrible person for having inflicted it on the child and tossed it  i would advocate against ever reading this to a child an adult can read this and see the compassion but a child should never be taught that this is acceptable behavior never ever ever had bought this cos i had heard a good deal about it and thought it would make a lovely prezzie for one of my great nephews and took a quick look in the book shop whilst christmas shopping yesterday and thought how lovely the drawings were and so wholeheartedly judged a book by its cover or at least its inside illustrations there is a lovely sense of the movement of the tree and the pages genuinely seem to express the ebb and flow of the trees life but the words good grief the words this is the weirdest story for children i have ever read  the human character who is all through the book seen from the eyes of the tree is called the boy even though he grows and matures and changes from toddler deeply in love with his tree to finally old man self centred and selfpitying in the course of his life he journeys down through a continual spiral of pillaging and abuse and finally sits unrepentant and unaware of his cruelty on the remnants of what once was loving and hopefilled and positive  as a parable or story it can only be interpreted as a song to selflessness if you block from your mind any sense of the behaviour of the man as the trees continual giving of herself  and the tree is very evidently female seems just to feed into the circle of self serving and irrepsonsibility of the antihero  reading it i cannot see what message other than humanitys right to rape and pillage the land can be drawn from it maybe it is one of those subliminal stories messaging subconscious calls to responsible stewardship of the land and concern for the wider world into the brains of young readers or listeners before they become hardened to destruction and deforestation but it just ends horribly the tree is a mishapen stump the boy a miserable embittered destroyer with absolutley no selfknowledge  now tell me i am taking the story too seriously and i will respond by saying what else are you supposed to do it is heralded as a classic story about love but it isnt it is a story about a desperately onesided relationship where one participant is prepared to do absolutely anything to keep the attention or interest of the other callous participant who really doesnt give a stuff and only wants the relationship for what he can cadge rip and rend from the others passive and doormatlike persona horrible horrible horrible no great nephew of mine is going to read this book until i am absolutley certain he will loathe with every fibre of his adorable little being the bastard that is the boy its not so much that i hate this story im not aware of what shel silversteins intentions were when writing it but i find it disgusting that people think this is a story of love and relationships and selflessness the boy takes and takes and takes from the tree until he can take no more and then when he can literally take no more from the tree he sits on her like a chair its ridiculous that people think this story is beautiful please read more books the story of the ungrateful boy and the selfless giving tree i honestly could not stand all this ingratitude and i dont see the point of this story i wanted to cry tears of frustration when i read it to my children never again i remember someone reading this book to me when i was younger and they talked about how important it is to be giving bullshit i was mad at the time about what happened to tree  then years later i reread it and thought maybe this story was about unconditional love and that im just a failure at that concept and should try to learn something about it  i just recently reread this and that is not at all the message of this story neither giving nor unconditional love it took me years to recognize that and realize how wrong these behaviors are on both sides  heres the real storymessage of this book grab the books and read along ive retold the truth of every page  once upon a time there was a lonely isolated tree who had no support network of family and friends to show her what love and friendship really are there was also nobody to kick her in the pants and tell her that she deserves good things in her life and relationships with others  intro boy who was a complete user but since hes small at first he gets a pass for some of his poor behaviors we excused his abuses as kids have no inherent malice at least he spent time with tree and he thought he loved her  and tree was supposedly happy though we have to ask ourselves does tree know that love should come with respect that she should be able to trust those she loves  time went by and the spoiled boy grew up into a selfcentered prat he cared nothing for the tree only his own greed and desires but since tree had serious boundary issues tree gave up her apples to please the boy something he took for granted since he was an unappreciative bastard  tree should have known it would never be enough but she trusted boy she thought she loved boy she wanted boy because it is hard to be isolated so she didnt see that boy was selfish and his love was false she didnt see that boy only took from her and never gave anything back  boy stole away all her apples and abandoned tree again without so much as a thank you  and tree thought this was normal because it had always been this way she lied to herself about being happy as she had learned to expect nothing better from boy than to be used and mistreated it was depressing that tree couldnt respect herself enough to develop a healthy relationship so depressing that tree was hollow and colorless  then boy returned and the cycle repeated he cut away at her taking more and more risking her life health and overall wellbeing and trees heart broke again  poor tree she couldnt break away from his emotional manipulations because she thought boy was giving her what she thought she deserved nothing  she truly believed that if she gave boy everything one day it would be enough and he would love her again tree didnt know that users like that are incapable of the kind of love she deserved  so boy took and took from tree year after year trying to make himself happy with material wealth spoiler alert people like that are never happy and tree suffered the cycle of abuse over and over again getting nothing in return not even boys love or boys time  by the end tree couldnt even recognize herself boy had hacked away at everything that was beautiful about tree until she had nothing of herself left and then she was so beaten down and brutalized that she became unhappy though she had difficulty even admitting it to herself she had done everything for boy to try to please him because she thought that would make him happy she failed to even consider what would make herself happy  and we all thought that would be the moment when tree would rise up and fight for herself that she had finally reached rock bottom and would have no choice but to step away from an abusive situation and try to start reclaiming some of herself but she didnt because she refused to admit that boy was the problem  so boy came back and tree immediately began apologizing because she couldnt figure out what to give of herself to make boy happy this time she was already practically dead and had been exposed to rot disease and pests due to boys brutality she didnt even have her selfrespect she was empty and said she had nothing left and we all believed her because we watched it happen in horror  and boy again disregarded tree completely to focus on his needs and how tired he was because he was quite possibly the most selfish prick to have ever graced the page so to add insult to continuous injury the boy sat on her further crushing tree beneath the weight of his abuse and neglect  and tree lied to herself and said she was happy with the little strand of life she had left because she thought that the only value and purpose her life had was in her complete service to boy at the total expense of herself  she didnt wave her branches in the breeze or shelter a nest of baby birds because boy cut her branches she didnt see new trees spring up from her apples to grow tall with her and become her friends because boy stole her apples further ensuring her isolation and unhappiness she didnt reach her full potential because she never considered that her life was worth something more than complete servitude to someone elses wishes and desires  tree was depressed and lying to herself boy was depressed and worrying about himself the reader is now depressed  this is the most horrific effing story of abuse to ever enter a childs hands and since  of women and  of men experience abuse in their lifetime perhaps its time to retire this extremely dated and sexist story for the sake of all genders lets not applaud the behaviors of boy or tree theyre both wrong in their actions and choices and people shouldnt behave in these ways its dangerous and unhealthy  the end i didnt like this book as much as some people did the tree was a good example of selfless generosity without expecting anything in return this contrasted dramatically with the boy who selfishly continually asked for something was never thankful and never reciprocated the kindness that was shown to him you know shel silverstein is yanking your chain here right you do realize that hes saying to himself even after death yes i believe he is if i dress up a toxic relationship dynamic with sweet sweet sentimentality will people buy it and keep on buying it  yes uncle shelby they will  shel silverstein is the frank zappa of childrens books hes at his most brilliant when he is poking you in the eye the one star is not for the book itself but for the book everyone seems to think this is so the parent gives and gives and gives to keep the child happy and expects nothing in return not even a thank you  that might be true but i dont see why children need to know that i mean i dont want my future kids to read this and conclude that mommy will happily give away her fruits and leaves and branches and want nothing in return  even if that is true  and why is the tree female why she and not it why is it always the woman who sacrifices herself for someone elses sake hated it when i was  nothings changed very interesting and sad little book read a few reviews on it and everyone has a different idea of what it is about and they may all be right  i think of it as an environmental book man with his greed and often needs has taken so much from this earth and when there is nothing left he will sit and ponder over it  when the last tree is cut the last fish is caught and the last river is polluted when to breathe the air is sickening you will realize too late that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you cant eat money by alanis obomsawin
Charlotte's Web,i dont give a fig if it is a kids book charlottes web is one of the most wellcrafted stories ever written this classic childrens tale deserves  stars for story craft and language usage alone read your strunk  white to understand this mans talents in that regard the fact that its a heartwarmerwrencher clinches it never was i made to love pigs and spiders so much in my life charlottes web will always rank high amongst my favorites but why for the love of god did they make us watch the cartoon version of this tearjerker in school did they want to make us weep embarrassingly in front of one another if so mission accomplished you sadistic school district pologies to anybody following my reviews in hope of insights into epic fantasy novels  i get through more kids stuff reading to my little girl who is too disabled to do it for herself  charlottes web is a book ive been aware of for nearly  years but somehow managed to avoid reading when i was little we picked it up at the hospice last week and read the first half then had to buy a copy at waterstones yesterday to finish it off  years in print and its still selling for  in paperback  the books a classic for good reason it delivers an emotional but refreshingly unsentimental story with twists and turns and inadvertently lets us have a look at rural american life in the late s in addition to a strong and engaging story eb white has powerful prose that doesnt confuse a child but carries more weight than youre likely to see in most childrens stories  theres a circle of life theme going on the amusing and varied anthropomorphising of various animals a county show and prizes to be awarded oh my but putting a welcome edge on all this is the bald fact that the pig you can see on the cover is balanced on a constant knife edge with people gearing up to reduce him to bacon and ham at every turn and although there are tender moments in the story its never saccharine slight spoiler the rat never comes through with a change of heart the little girl grows up and loses interest in the animals end slight spoiler  all in all a fine childrens book perhaps it id read it when i was  id be giving it  some pig  charlottes web is the story of an unlikely friendship between a runt of a pig named wilbur and a spider named charlotte one day wilbur hears from one of the farm animals that he is destined to be christmas dinner however one animal is determined to save him charlotte she starts to weave messages into her web about how incredible wilbur is will it be enough to save the pig  when i was a child i saw this movie and found it very moving as an adult i read this story and i still think it is very moving but i have a deeper respect for the symbolism  since january i have been going full tilt with the readalongs so i put a pause on them and of course i am regretting that decision because charlottes web is such a great book for discussion  first this book can be interpreted in a variety of ways for example wilbur breaks free from his pen all of the animals are giving him conflicting information about what he should do run uphill run downhill etc while in a state of confusion wilbur is lured into his pen by the farmer with a bucket of slop  this reminded me of counteroffers in the workplace your corporation might be perfectly content with you working  in a dark closet in the back of the building never to be seen or heard from and at a low rate of pay when you finally find another company who will actually treat you decently your old company tries to lure you back into their fold with a tempting offer wilburs situation also reminds me of a classic abusive relationship where the person afflicted wants to leave but feels compelled to stay especially without a clear plan for extraction from the situation  second there are a lot of relationships in this book that give me pause if you read my review on the giving tree i absolutely hate it but i love charlottes web maybe because wilbur loves charlotte in return what do you make of fern is wilbur just a phase to her is templeton really a friend or is he just a hired hand and thats all he wants to be are you upset that wilbur receives all the praise when it is really charlotte that is extraordinary  my favorite character dr dorian he seems to be the most sensible person of them all  third i love this book because it encourages praise versus complaining charlotte spins kind words into her web about wilbur and he tries to live up to them she doesnt write needs bath into her web instead she spins a positive adjective  what do you think of charlotte spinning the word humble do you think that being humble is a bad thing in this day and age  overall this book is deeply moving has beautiful illustrations provides a lot of valuable food for thought and the action is fast paced one of the great tearjerkers of my longlost childhood the unlikely friendship between a spider and a pig makes for wonderful reading and a shared moment of love when reading it to kids it is tender and teaches the values of constancy and integrity in a light beautiful prose a classic and a masterpiece another classic read with the kids i love reading to them  they enjoy a chapter every evening and it gives us some good quality family time also it is cool to see them disappointed if we dont have time to read sad but cool that it is so important to them  if you dont remember charlottes web from your childhood did you even have a childhood  while it is dated  even more so now than when i read it as a kid  it is a timeless tale of life death and friendship there are so many amazingly deep facets in this little book written for children i am pretty sure a group of adults could still have a very deep discussion about the themes plot points and characters in this book  i mentioned that death is a key part of this book some may think that could be too much for kids but i feel like white presented it in the perfect way to show that death and rebirth are a part of life perfect in a way as to not upset kids and allow them to explore their curiosity on the subject  if you have never read charlottes web you really should this is quite ridiculous that i should read this at yearsold for the third time in my life and end up blubbering hot tears all over my face and down the front of my shirt  i cant get over that my youngest at yearsold sat through the entire book this week mesmerized by the brilliant and timeless storytelling she giggled frequently at the funny passages and then she laughed at me her grown mother crying a river for the last  pages i honestly cried to the point of being physically incapable of reading out loud  and then as charlottes babies drifted away shouting goodbye goodbye goodbye my daughters face contorted strangely and the next thing i knew she was face down on the floor sobbing uncontrollably  this is one powerful story i feel like i did something right by picking up this book years after of having it in my toberead list  i picked it up at the right time as on th april  as i have picked up this book at least  times before during a span of  years  at first i thought it would be a really short childrens fiction with lots of pictures of animals and the family of the little girl on the book cover  but i got genuinely surprised the way it weaved an unforgettable story of various animals with distinct personalities who live in a barn together sharing the ups and downs of life  i would say this book is pretty insightful in understanding kids from their perspective as well as some very useful information regarding the animals charlotte the spider as one of the main characters which is one of the best nonhuman fictional characters ever wilbur the pig which was almost given up for being the weakest at birth templeton the rat which is notorious for his catty remarks the geese family which speaks the truth and provided entertainment during the whole story the way these characters were written how bits of information about these animals were interwoven in the story isnt like a chore as it tends to happen in most of childrens books this book is entertaining this book is fun to read it is packed with emotions it ended beautifully  you wont believe i cried towards the end of the book the story seems so real a good book is a good book no matter for whom its written for  i am so glad i read this book finally i always get in the mood for this book when county fair season rolls around ah the midway with its dizzying rides and scary carny folk the agriculture buildings featuring prizewinning giant produce and lovingly crafted quilts and the yummy scents of frying dough competing with the much earthier smells emanating from the livestock tents  it smelled of hay and it smelled of manure it smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows it often had a sort of peaceful smell  as though nothing bad could ever happen again in the world  i always pay a visit to the cows sheep and pigs temporarily housed there and try not to think about how many of them are doomed already auctioned off to local restaurants with that sad fact in mind is it any wonder how this fanciful tale can grip the imagination and tug at the heart    the story of zuckermans famous pig  wilbur the pig who lived  the book begins with our hero narrowly avoiding the ax saved from death by a young girl who promises to raise him he grows and thrives under her care but soon hes sentenced to a lonely life in a pen at her uncles farm but fret not for he soon meets charlotte a large grey spider with an impeccable vocabulary  it is truly the beginning of a beautiful and unforgettable friendship  i know this is a childhood favorite for many readers but i was introduced to these characters not through the book but by the  animated film  description  because of this i will always associate paul lyndes memorably snarky voice with templeton the rat  description whats in it for meeee  i should be ashamed to admit that i didnt read the book until  but im not i think i appreciated it more fully as an aging adult than i would have as a kid having lost some friends and both parents i know how fleeting life can be and how important it is to grab onto every last experience and memory how strange that it is the wisdom of a spider that reminds us of what matters most in our lives  no pig ever had truer friends and he realized that friendship is one of the most satisfying things in the world  adding to the joy of the book are the sweet illustrations by garth williams  description  description  so thank you mr white for your most marvelous book i can think of no other author who could make an arachnophobe like me shed tears over the death of a spider my  years old self would have loved this book i had been looking for an excuse to read this book for years and just realised on seeing it this week in a book shop that i didnt need an excuse to read it i can just pick it up and indulge myself in little animal behaviour and so i enjoyed this beautiful story of a livestock pig named wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named charlotte  this book is so beautifully written and the illustrations in the copy i have just made it that much better friendship and love are the central themes of charlottes web this is a terrific childrens book which i think many adults like myself will appreciate the story as well and i am going to hold on to this copy as i hope if the future long distant future to take it out again and perhaps read to my grand children  i seem to have missed out on so many of these great books that i should have read as a child but as the saying goes  better late than never and so nice to choose one to read every now and then one of my favorite childhood memories is of reading this book with my mother i remember how much i giggled at some of the funny situations and cried especially when we read it the first few times sobbing into my pillow with my mom rubbing my back i wondered why charlotte had to die my mom patiently explaining the gift charlotte left for wilbur even now i feel a bit of a lump in my throat it was treasures like this that started my love of books and reading  i loved it so much i dont know how many times i read it over the years such a timeless classic that will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come it was easy to understand and i loved the illustrations the characters were so well developed and completely lovable i wanted to move to a farm right away and have my very own baby pig so many life lessons  it was all in there the meaning of true friendship love lifes adventures miracles death trust betrayal sorrow and the passing of time enjoyable to both children and adults i hope everyone reads this book at least once in their lives truly a timeless classic  slowly slowly said charlotte never hurry and never worry  charlottes web is one of those books that anyone can enjoy irrespective of our age language might be very simple and plain but once you picked up this you will quickly find out that this is probably one of the best stories you have ever read author not only brings the readers a lot of fun with this little story but also has a very subtle way of conveying a few of life lessons and as for children i believe letting them experience such pure perspectives on life will assist them see the world quite differently  in a better way  after all whats a life anyway were born we live a little while we die favorites   favoritesfiction i have been familiar with the story for most of my life but never read it until now  wilbur the pig is born a runt and the farmer decides he must face the axe kindhearted little fern intercedes and saves him she cares for the undersized pig who later goes to a nearby farm wilburs life is nearly idyllic until he discovers the fate that has been woven for him he will likely be the next christmas ham horrified he looks desperately for a door of escape his pleas for help are overhead by a large grey spider who is almost invisible in the doorway she decides to try to alter the thread by which his destiny is hanging but will she succeed  the barnyard animals while displaying some human characteristicscharlotte the spider can read and even has a smattering of latinbehave like the animals they are the geese are noisy and silly the rat is sly and greedy the pig is goodnatured and always hungry the spider while kindly is also an opportunistic and bloodthirsty killer  the story is one of friendship loyalty and selfsacrifice while at times it threatens to cross over into a sort of victorian sentimentality it never quite does because the author injects touches of humour and irony into the portrayal of both animal and human characters wilbur is some pig who is radiant and humble on the top of that he could do a mean back flip like the karate kid    but would you believe me if i said that this radiant pig was almost killed twice this is wilburs remarkable journey from almost being bacon to a beacon in the community but this is not just his journey its about fern the little girl who saved wilburs life when he was just a runt and its about charlotte a smart and sweet spider who befriends wilbur  and charlotte can spell its like she has eaten a spelling bee wink wink  its a great childrens book if i were a kid i wouldve loved it even more and as an adult well an almost adult i loved the descriptions on summer it was almost as if i could feel my childhood and charlottes protective instincts towards wilbur i was not quite sure about parts focusing on fern they seemed a bit off towards the end  oddly enough charlotte also reminded me of the characters from hidden figures the american dream and the untold story of the black women mathematicians who helped win the space race well food for thought  in the end charlottes web is a story about kindness and love its about reaffirming faith in a persons personality and values rather than appearances and above all its about the value of friendship  one of the very best from the first line to the last line and everything in between this is some book  this wellknown classic kids book is all its cracked up to be charlotte is the nicest wisest spider youll ever meet wish i could think of sweet charlotte the next time i see a creepy crawly spider but im sure the memory of her will go right out the window and ill run for my life as always  everyone should read this book well probably every one has but true confession here when my teacher read the book to our class over a few weeks my yearold self daydreamed off every time yep thats me the attention span of a shoofly how did i do this i want to know since now reading it more than  years later i was completely captivated  i guess i wanted to give back what i didnt allow myself to receive way back when an amazing heartwrenching read so i read the book to eliska the yearold i kidsit for she had liked the movie so was up for a readaloud i did not appreciate it when halfway into the story she proudly blurted out the sad ending the stinkershe knew what she was doing and she just wanted to see my expressionwhich of course was pure shock and dismay she thought she was hilarious i wish she had gotten the memo on spoilers  theres so much good about this story about two friends a spider charlotte and a pig wilbur talking animals quite a trip there are stuttering geese a wiseguy rat the best part was charlotte writing in her web in the hope that she could save wilbur i loved the words she chose and how she acquired them tickled me to deathso ingenious a good lesson in the power of words the power of language the first thing charlotte wrote in the web was some pig  warning the rest of this socalled review is just a true story about the drama seriously not important drama that occurred while i read this book proceed if you want but i wont be insulted if you ignore it  while i read eliska always does some craft once she made rubberband earrings that could have mutilated my ears but luckily she warned me and i removed them the second i left the premises this time she decided to give me a tattoo oh she did ask first as she dangled the tattoo pens in my face when i hestitated she assured me that the tattoo would wash right off i nodded okay and she went to town on my wrist i figured the tattoo would be the size of a dime but as i read about the fate of charlotte and wilbur i saw out of the corner of my eye that it was a multicolored flower the size of a postit note hmthat thing is big i agained ask if she was sure it would come off this time her story changed a little oh in a couple of days for sure she says what it hits me that she has no idea whether it will come off what have i let her do am i nuts i subdued my freakout and kept my head inside charlottes web how my reading voice stayed calm i do not know  eliska was done and i have to say the tattoo was pretty next she started going crazy painting her fingers with mulitcolored stripes at first i thought they looked cool but then i started seeing them through a moms her moms eyes and i realized they were pretty uglyloud and bright brass knuckles except they didnt cover just the knuckles every square inch of her fingers was soaked in marker pen it suddenly occurred to me that maybe mom would not appreciate the fact that i let her kid write all over her hands maybe i was in deep doodoo i started getting antsy and i asked eliska are you sure these wash off she promptly went and washed off one finger and returned huge blue spots like bruises were what remained it looked like she had used the brass knuckles for crying out loud she giggled nervously as i gasped well if you scrub it with one of those hard brushes that you wash dirty nails with more will come off she said like this would reassure me we all know those brushes are nasty scrubbing my old wrist might scrub off the skin for all i know were talking pain and where to find such a brush in the first place i dont have one lying around  freakout time at this point i was more worried about eliskas painted fingers than my tattoo what if her mom was furious what kind of babysitter lets a kid drench her skin with ink maybe eliska liked this new look so much that shell become a badass when shes  and cover her body in tattoos her mom will blame me for surethe babysitter with no sense the babysitter who was too busy reading charlottes web to notice the kid ruining her soft clear skin with ugly ink  aha moment maybe i should have had eliksa draw graffiti on me that said some babysitter maybe instead of her mom being mad at me for letting eliska loose with tattoo pens shed be impressed just like the world was impressed that charlotte had written some pig and it had saved wilburs life  yep maybe a some babysitter tattoo would save my job i threw the idea out to eliska who was in the middle of deciding whether her next finger should have three or four stripes she thought i was nutswhat was wrong with the beautiful flower she painted writing words wouldnt be any fun and come to think of it it depends on how you interpret some babysitter anyway if you emphasize the some you could mean that was some babysitter alright she was a humdinger ie bad so maybe it was best that i didnt steal charlottes idea after all  it was the dad who came home and i didnt see him notice eliskas hands you better believe i was glad that it wasnt mom who walked in that door but i never heard a word about it no news is good news eliska must have had an easier time removing the ink than i had thought  what about my tattoo when i got home i looked at it a lot but i didnt try to remove it right away i was afraid that if i did id have a blue blob like eliskas painted finger i was trying to ignore it so that id chill it didnt help when my husband glanced at my arm and said what you got a tattoo no way i could pretend it never happened i told him the story adding it will wash right off though i didnt for a second believe it he was so excited he took pictures and sent it out to our daughters look mom got a tattoo it horrified me that it looked that real if the tattoo looks so real does that mean its permanent i kept telling myself that there was no way that eliskas mom would allow her to have permanent markers in the house no way  i frettedshould i wait a few days before i tried to wash it off no that would be torture i needed to know now so after a few hours i tried and damn if the tattoo the beautiful tattoo didnt disappearcompletely no scrubbing necessary and no blue blob in sight  you know ill always think of the tattoo whenever i think about charlottes web that was some book wilbur was some pig i was some babysitter i grew up without reading this book for some that seems to be unimaginable i can maybe understand why my wife and i are reading it now or i should say i am reading it aloud before bed and its really wonderful i could totally see why it would be a kind of lifeformative book i was reading a passage last night and laughing at it there is so much in here that is really funny and it made me wonder about the level of the humor that is would the kid me have thought this was funny or is it my adult self and i think probably the kid would have this is all to say that reading it now as an adult it gives me an appreciation for kids minds and kids books that take them seriously even in their humor i hope that all makes sense im a late comer to the harry potter books too but was really delighted by them in some of the same ways  butto get back to charlottes webtheres a section about the end of summer a couple chapters away from their fair trip white makes this lovely kind of song about the end of the season and the coming of fall and the kind of beauty and dread and tinged sadness of it all my god it was affecting thats something that i probably would not have picked up on as a kid but i think that has more to do with kidme than with most kids i know my wife remembered that part distinctly in fact it is one of the reasons we went back to this book now we have recently moved from minnesota our home for about four years and fair time there just passed we really experienced the sort of sad beauty of summers end there in our new place in chapel hill it hasnt happened quite yet it is still hot and very dry from drought so i dont know if there will be that kind of fading moment or not well have to see  anyhow when a book for kids whateverfor all of us can make you laugh and cry and think about the beautiful sadness of deaththen damn what can you do but ramble as i now join the millions of readers who have enjoyed this great book i realize it truly is a book for all ages loved every minute of it i have been listening to or reading charlottes web since  my first grade teacher mrs bunting read this magical book to our class and i can vividly remember sitting on my carpet square entranced her reading that book to our class was the highlight of each day later that year there was a movie in the theaters and we went to see it as a class field trip from my memory everyone in class was excited about the book and the movie this was book was that important in the lives of early readers  i also remember the book fair that school year and my mom allowed me to buy one book and bookmark these were the days of unicorns and rainbows and my first bookmark had both    im sure you can guess what my purchase was my copy of charlottes web was read more times than i could ever possibly keep track and as some of my book friends know even at age  i worked hard to keep that wellloved book in pristine condition  we still have my copy somewhere and im on a mission to find it  all of that to say when audible had a sale recently on the audio read by eb white in the s i quickly bought it you know an audio is good when you are instantly ready to listen to it again there is nothing better than the author of the perfect book reading his own perfect words so much love and connection in his voice tone and inflection some books are full of magic that lives in your heart forever and charlottes web is certainly in mine may i say that this book is one of the most tender and cute my daughter and i ever read yes she is  years old and we still love to read together just before bedtime we really appreciated this precious friendship between charlotte and philbert the pig as the way they respect each other and got joyful for the small little events and things they encountered during the days charlotte way of being a mom friend and then a guide to philbert was really lovely and emotional the legacy charlottes will leave to her friend pig are new lives to protect at any cost in order to protect charlottes legacy and memory too we really loved the description of the farms life and how all the other animals interact between each others within  minutes of reviewing its top  novels written in english list i knew the modern library was irrelevant thats because it failed to include charlottes web i mean i realize that childrens literature is considered a joke by most intellectuals but get serious anybody who reads this story and fails to recognize its greatness doesnt really like books in my opinion  not only does charlottes web feature one of the most ingenious plots in all of literature its prose is breathtaking notice how white evokes the arrival of winter on the zuckerman farm in one short paragraph  the autumn days grew shorter lurvy brought the squashes and pumpkins in from the garden and piled them on the barn floor where they wouldnt get nipped on frosty nights the maples and birches turned bright colors and the wind shook them and they dropped their leaves one by one to the ground under the wild apple trees in the pasture the little red apples lay thick on the ground and the sheep gnawed them and the geese gnawed them and foxes came in the night and sniffed them one evening just before christmas snow began falling it covered the house and barn and fields and woods wilbur had never seen snow before  i mean what could be more evocative or sensual and the fact that white does this in such simple language only underscores his reputation as a great writer  if you have fond memories of charlottes web from childhood i urge you to read it again i wish the folks at the modern library had before compiling their list i was ten almost eleven the summer i first read charlottes web  understanding life and death the cycle of life is never easy even so we hear about death since we are very little and we learn about people and things being born the two extremes of that cycle learning is not understanding  understanding often comes from experiencing and experiencing the cycle of life as a a child its as hard a experience as they come yet the beginning of it may not be such a difficult thing to live through we perhaps get a baby brother or sister or the neighbors cat has kittens and one of those kittens comes to live in your house to be your fourlegged companion a first glance weve started to understand what being born means and thats something  later as life goes on we see plants and insects died sometimes under the soles of an adults shoe or even our own if we are unlucky or perhaps just not very lucky a pet of ours would die when we are still very young giving us a better understanding of what death means  so understanding life and death is an endeavor that takes wonderful experiences and terrible experiences and that is what charlottes web is all about  it all starts one morning over breakfast when fern sees her father heading outside ax in hand and she asks an innocent question wheres papa going with that ax the answer is simple hes going to kill the runt pig of the newest litter  fern horrified despite understanding that without a dead piggy there be no bacon begs his father to spare the little piglet then she nurses him into a healthy pig yet its charlotte the pretty but rather large and hairy spider living over the pigs wilbur nook who really saves wilburs life and she does it using words words she weaves into her web words she uses to describe how extraordinary wilbur is  and its charlottes perception of wilburs extraordinarity what ensures everyone believing that he really is an extraordinary pig hes not like any other pig and therefore will never share their fate and soon he becomes famous  this is a book ive liked since the first time i read it but that has much to offer to readers that are not children its a book that treats some of the hardest events of our lives with love and respect helping us both understand and cope with such events  now some mentions are a bit outdated but nothing that parents talking to their children about the story cant solve  all in all a wonderful read it may sound weird but this is the first time i am reading this book i dont know how i missed out on it when i was a kid maybe it was the famous  or hardy boys or nancy drew anyway if i had read it as a kid i might have mustered some sympathy for wilbur right now though i am just mad such a whinny and annoying crybaby met enough people like him in real life poor charlotte  my personnel bitchy nature aside this book was amazing a quick read but it makes an impact beautiful lessons on friendship and kindness my favorite quote  why did you do all this for me he asked i dont deserve it ive never done anything for you you have been my friend replied charlotte that in itself is a tremendous thing  at least wilbur got that right go charlotte well i dont like to spread bad news said the sheep but theyre fattening you up because theyre going to kill you thats why  theyre going to what screamed wilbur fern grew rigid on her stool  kill you turn you into smoked bacon and ham continued the old sheep almost all young pigs get murdered by the farmer as soon as the real cold weather sets in theres a regular conspiracy around here to kill you at christmastime everybody is in on the plot  lurvy zuckerman even john arable pg   this book is amazing childrens literature its as fresh and beloved as children today as it was when it was first published in  thats an achievement  i must have read this book dozens of times not only by myself but to countless children still delights still entrances still tugs at heartstrings  the book opens powerfully with young fern age  stepping in to stop her father from killing a piglet with an ax  wheres papa going with that ax said fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast  out to the hoghouse replied mrs arable some pigs were born last night  i dont see why he needs an ax continued fern who was only eight  well said her mother one of the pigs is a runt its very small and weak and it will
Little Women,i hated this book  i cant even begin to go into all the reasons i dislike this novel its dull and preachy through out most of itaside from jo who is a truly inspired character but everyone else seems one note most of the chapters come off as morality plays than solid scenes or plots and just when miss alcott has something seemingly interesting she breaks it for no other reason than to do something  whether its the pairing of amy and laurie huh the point made constantly that beths life isnt useless because she is an angel and showed them that angels do exist and is a total mary suereally cause im glad she died before i died of boredom the forced pairing of jo and the professor why i meanreally just keep her single there is also the message that pursing art is selfish jo giving up her writing laurie gives up his music amy gives up her sketching  its not a message i expectedthis book is always lauded as one that has inspired countless girls to do what because outside of jos sipirt i dont really see much to aspire to in this tsory the overall message seems to be that as a good christian one should sacrifice being an artist being in love with who you want and any hope of independence  its not because im from the modern era that i dislike this book or that im an adult reading it if you look at other works being done in the same time period you will see that there were stories with less moralizing being doneincluding by miss alcott herself i was just really disappointed never liked this one i read alcott back around the time i was first reading the brontes and dickens and her books always struck me as incredibly dull in comparison i was probably about  though so i suppose i should try it again someday to me this book is just a big neon highlighted literary exclamation mark defining how incredibly different i am from my mother she loves this book really really loves ita lot she always used to tell me how great she thought it was although as a kid i somehow avoided reading it mainly because at this point i was too busy dangling from a climbing frame by my ankles or stealing scrap wood from building sites in order to make dens and tree houses  as it is prominently placed on the  books list i thought what the hell ill give it a go man oh man what an epic snooze fest less than twenty pages in i could feel my mind slowly shutting down was it through boredom or was i entering a diabetic coma because of the saccharine overload created by the sickly sweet world of margaret jo beth and amy anyway to avoid succumbing to said coma i threw the book as far away from me as i could and then chucked a blanket over it to ensure that i wouldnt be effected by the mind numbing dullness being exuded from between the covers  i know that i risk howls of outrage at this lambasting of a much loved classic but this ticked no boxes for me i am clearly dead inside read as part of the infinite variety reading challenge based on the bbcs big read poll of   the one thing im not going to do is apologise for not liking this i hold no truck with that stop apologising for having an opinion that is different to the majority  little women was relatively written well in the grammatically correct sense but i found it to be a very slow and dull read it is definitely of its time and even though there are small points of seeing the necessity of having strong independent female characters inevitably they always end up having to rely on men or indeed other women in order to survive within the narrative  there was no clear and concise plot just a bunch of little stories that all fit together in a relevant manner but altogether it was pretty much a huge heap of nothing happened i liked the differences of the sisters but found their outward appearancedifferences rather farfetched and they didnt seem to look like sisters in my mind nor did their personalities really shine through as being particularly familial in fact it felt more as if they were just friends and not sisters and i didnt see any of the sibling love as anything but friendship i also didnt like how they were very different to each other as if none of them shared even one particular trait or indeed any similar hobby or desire  i think itd be fair to say that this is a definite childrens tale though perhaps quite the preachy kind i disagree its one you can only really enjoy if you read it as a child however because there are plenty of childrens books that are just as enjoyable for the first time as an adult little women had never actually struck me as a book to ever be read anyway and it was mostly just a getitoutoftheway kind of read there are no actual little women in this book all regular sized women title is misleading  would not read again apparently im an awful person i just completely hated this which came as quite a surprise i was expecting jane austenness whom i love but while the language was similar the sentimentality was cloying the moralizing unrelenting the plot lurching serialized im guessing the characters caricatures the themes of goodness love and moral responsibility revolting this is what our foremothers at one time believed was the ideal for womanhood no wonder they eventually revolted but this is what american women aspired to flaccid beribboned personhoodless dolls shock and outrage i concede that i must read about alcott and the historical context of this book that everyone else loves but i doubt that could reverse my interpretation one positive is jo march the first transgendered woman in american literature the constant harping on jos boyishness and frustration with her female lot was authentic and just a little too distinct methinks jo march circa s would be taking hormones adding an e and being a lot happier i hate this book i hate hate hate hate hate this book this book is insipid this book makes me feel like i need a trip to the dentist after merely looking at the cover  i hate this book  i hate jo and her supposed tomboyishness and the fact that she is the most flat and dull and stupid character ive ever come across i hate amy because shes a vapid idiot who contributes nothing to the story i hate meg even though i dont remember anything about her i hate beth more than them all combined because she is so holyholy and meek and perfect and then she goes and dies except in the versions where she doesnt and everyone loves her even more afterwards  excuse me while i retch  why must this book be so vomitous it even starts off in this fashion  let us give our dinner to the poor because we are so wonderful fuck off just fuck off if there was ever such a saintly family i hope i never meet them my boyfriends diabetic and we must watch his blood sugar levels no wonder theres a childrens version of this book most kids havent experienced actual pain and these characters obviously came from a bad fairytale o gee im awfully glad that you girls have become so happy in life too bad their lives are hardly realistic o no their fathers fighting in the war and they are poor o my how selfless they gave food to an even poorer family everybody loves each other to death they even have an artist and writer in the family but some of the girls have trouble in love aw nuts what a shame i think ill go to france or somewhere to find myself because im so poor please pity me wow what a coinkydink theres the guy who liked my sister do i seem like a skank the love situations appear to be the only drama happening theres the death of beth but she wasnt even important also this book is full of cliches eg meg is more than content to be a housewife because she has no talent alcott thought was worth mentioning however i cant complain too much about jo because i actually like her it would have been interesting if she turned out similar to sylvia plath but that just plainly contradicts alcotts style look i cant i cant im sorry i just cant i understand that this is a beloved classic for many people and lord knows i tried but this is just the most inane and boring book that ive read in a very long time ive read the first half which is about  pages im halfway through and praying for the end i think its a bad principle to leave books unfinished but im not doing it because the writing is hard its just that this book isnt giving me anything its not hard to read its just not good  my main problem with this book is that it did not age well this should never ever have left the th century i feel that there are hundreds of novels like this you know novels written between  and  specifically for entertaining young ladies and teaching them to be virtuous and industrious the great majority of them just faded into oblivion i dont understand what went wrong with little women and why it didnt but i deeply believe it should have this is a morality novel where the characters are used and abused to make cheap points about virtue and proper behaviour a novel set during a war that doesnt seem to exist apart from a vaguely absent father and abstract financial difficulties quickly resolved by a rich neighbour a novel where everyone talks in exclamation points by the way people didnt talk like that a coming of age story where characters just seem to grow more and more childish  this reads like a book a mother in the late th century would give her tomboy daughter so she would learn how to behave but nowadays it just doesnt seem to be relevant or interesting in any way and every time i thought oh look this is getting interesting it didnt it disappointed me i would like to finish it someday but i cant summon up the energy or the patience to go about it now im sorry clearly responsible for the suicides of several important thinking female writers this book teaches that   strong women should compromise their beliefs in order to get married  even the poorest families have servants  its normal to have a competition over who can be the most altruistic  never read alcott after reading either anne sexton and sylvia plath  books written to make money and entertain children are bad regardless of their status as classic look im going to be brutally honest here i read this when i was about  and i quite enjoyed it but reading it at the age of  oh my god this was the most saccharine sweet intolerable twaddle ive ever had the misfortune of reading  all four of the girls are so ridiculously perfect that even when they make the tiny little mistakes that are painted as monumental fuck ups in the book theyre instantly fixed with a sweet smile or a sermon from their mother about women needing to control their anger or remembering how nice it is to be poor  as the girls get older they become slightly less insufferable but i gave zero fucks about any of their romantic relationships and i just wanted beth to hurry up and die because she was so perfect and so insufferable and i kind of wanted to punch her in the face  so this is really a one star book that gets an extra star because jo was actually a half way decent character most of the time and up until a certain point in the story i had a very nice asexual jo march headcanon going on i wanted to love this novel so much and thus i set myself up for failure ill try to adequately summarize my thoughts however i feel a little scatterbrained its taken me a long time to get through this novel and thus not everything is fresh in my mind i wont be tagging any spoilers so if you still havent read this havent watched the movie or live under rock then i advise you to stay clear of my review  ish  part one if i had to rate the first part of this novel i would have given it no higher than one star its so dreadful to read through multiple moral lessons from a woman that often time teaches her daughters to humble themselves for men i understand that this is a classic and thus the values and morals have changed however this is a novel that is still praised for the lessons it is teaching these lessons are mostly boring and arise out of natural circumstances  i dont know about you but my upbringing did not result in a lecture after everything i did i learned things on my own and it felt that the little women were often time coddled its no wonder i severely despise the woman meg and jo had grown into  additionally mr march might be the second worst character both the marches are incredibly one dimensional his only importance to the story was when he was away at war and once he returned he served no purpose  megs love story with brooke makes my blood boil within five minutes meg goes from declining his proposal to declaring her love for him to defy aunt march there exists no romance or chemistry between them and shes still the same immature child she was five minutes ago this concludes the first part and leads us to  part two im not a particular fan of the style of writing and some chapters read more easily than others there are the select few chapters that were phenomenally written i wish i could pluck these out bind them in their own novel and reread this instead the chapters are literary lessons heartache beths secret lazy laurence and the valley of the shadow  first and foremost the jolaurieamy debate shouldnt exist in my opinion laurie proposed at the wrong time had he waited until both him and jo were older i think she would have said yes regardless of whether he got his life together like amy demanded him to both laurie and jo were still childish and despite her young age amy was able to put laurie in shape to be the respectable gentleman his grandfather wanted him to be  what we should all be focusing on is beths death i dont think it was avoidable and it plays a pivotal part in the story it certainly made me sad but the strongest emotion this chapter evoked from me was anger  why would beth doom jo by making her promise to stay with their parents upon her death  from page one jo has been waiting for an opportunity to travel and gain experiences and instead jo is forced to take beths place had beth lived i believe she would have married a simple man like mr march and continued taking care of her parents and family nearby because of her death beth needed someone to fill that place and thus came in jo this pissed me the fuck off as soon as jo makes that promise any life she had planned vanished and with that she met crusty ass fucking professor bhaer and crossed herself off my list of characters i love  i dont think i will ever hate a character as much as bhaer this man is so condescending and self centered hes as one dimensional as mr march were going full circle here he literally read a poem about the little women let me repeat that the little women and pulled out a sentence about love and said diz here iz about me professorine like shut the fuck up  which brings me to the fucking end of course amy is doomed with a sick child because she named her kid after beth jo i couldnt give a fuck about after she gave a second thought to a crusty old man meg i hated from the first page doesnt even matter if they mention beth because jo took her place  the more i think about this novel the more i think about how much i hate it and how it doesnt make up for the  chapters i enjoyed out of  had i read this novel as a child and grown up with it maybe i would have liked it very weak maybe but i think a piece of literature should be judged despite what age you read it at and this just didnt do it for me  thank god for greta gerwig and being able to make a phenomenal movie out of such a mediocre novel   yes i just watched the  film adaptation for the first time and i am emotional  no i will not be taking questions at this time thank you there is much to enjoy in little women especially if you prefer the values of life taught in conservative religious daycare centers gentle reader  marmee march who is obviously a fertility goddess raises four young human girls  margaret  jo  beth  and amy   by herself during the civil war chaplain march rumored to be the human father of the four girls but who i believe is actually a zombie or a holy ghost has volunteered to serve president lincolns troops by ministering to the soldiers at the warfront while his wife and children soldier on in genteel poverty in massachusetts taking jobs such as governess or companion to elderly rich people  each girl has a distinct personality at the start unfortunately but by the last page having learned in depth the housecleaning and cooking skills allowed thcentury females to learn as well as in finishing up the rest of their meager basic education filtered through christian values into a loving acceptance of their erasure as individual personas they all successfully transition into modest obedient selfeffacing wives and mothers one is fortunate to find a position as a trophy wife while another becomes a proliferate baby maker last but not least it appears one of the women may become a respectable daycare operator specializing in the emasculation of males i do not want to speak too much about the one who escaped this utopia that was sad  i genuinely tried liking little women especially since i loved greta gerwigs movie it just didnt work for me i was so utterly bored i tried continuing thinking that i will like it because it is such a loved novel that has so many people in love with the characters and such but i cant get through this i want to move onto something that i actually will enjoy  alcotts novel will be enjoyed by people who like feminist themes in their novels in my opinion this was just so meh so unenjoyable i know that back when this was first published this would have been mindboggling but as i dont live back then and dont really have an interest in learning the ideologies of the time i just kind of gave up  one thing that i did find interesting was everyones hate for amy why does everyone hate amy if the novel only focused on her i think i would have enjoyed it much more she was so interesting i loved seeing her progression from being a little girl to becoming womanly and being punched in the face with reality i know that she burned jos manuscript but jo is basically a terrible sister to amy for no reason i know she gets laurie in the end but it isnt her fault that laurie fell in love with her so yeah i am an amy fan  i dont have much to say about this novel it didnt really evoke much emotion in me so i am not able to go as indepth as i usually like to if you are looking for a classic that i think is a better pick if you are looking for themes about growing up please read the catcher in the rye i loved this one  i have a toothache from this book because it is so saccharine every situation described has an underlying moral every heartache can be chalked up to a lesson learned about something and every chapter made my eyes roll if every hallmark movie ever made with an underlying christian morality tale could be condensed to a single chapter those chapters combined would then basically be this book if it wasnt for this novel being the choice for book club i would have gladly quit this i will say the second half did get better as the girls became women and had concerns that went deeper than the earlier chapters where for example the girls did no work for a couple of weeks and learned the life lesson that work does you good but the more mature life situations wasnt enough to make up for the one chapter that made me want to throw this book across the room much earlier on  the next door neighbor laurie invites jo and meg to a show and the youngest sister amy throws a fit that jo wont let her invite herself along in revenge amy takes the only copy of a book that jo had been writing for years and burns it she later gives an apology but jo doesnt accept it and basically ignores her jo and laurie then go ice skating and because amy wants to go ice skating too she decides to join them and use her desire to makeup with jo as an excuse to again do what she wants despite what others may want she then falls into the water where the ice is thin is saved by laurie and then jo and amy then make up because amy could have died say what needless to say i reject the moral to this story amy needed a beat down  another highlight was the chapter on megs marriage woes because she had twin infants and wasnt giving her husband enough attention basically i had issues with a lot of the morals in this book granted im not expecting progressive morality from a book written over a  years ago but i do expect it to as least be mildly entertaining or compelling to read and this book was neither of those things so yeah dont recommend sorry not sorry i wanted to love it but i found it so boring  i had watched the film of little women many moons ago and i seem to remember thinking it was watchable so i wanted to see if the book was better than the film  i found out rather early on in the book that it definitely was not i have to admit im slightly disappointed here with how i feel about this book i expected and wanted more i wasnt at all emotionally bound with any of the four sisters and their lives i was waiting for something to happen all the time but was instead met with mindnumbing blandness  jo was probably my favourite character and even then she wasnt actually that lovable this was so unfilling and definitely overhyped as an apparent classic in my life so far this is the only star book i would ever recommend folks despite the iconic status and its being a super american classic tens of thousands of you awarding stars little women did absolutely nothing for me in  hours  i know i know consider it was written by a woman at a time when literature was dominated by men know that it was the first of its kind largely about women and for women understand that it wasand still isone of the greatest novels of americana realize thats its been in continuous publication for  years my god man dont you know that all your greatgrandmothers read little women dozens of times and then reread it to your grandmother who in turn read it to your aunts and nieces and great aunts and cousins and the girls next door you cant award stars to this book  bullcrap with all due respect  yeah i know its timepiece literature and had much greater impact before my time i know there are life lesson within but i rate a book based on its impact on me at the time of reading  ive read a lot of classic literature and i appreciate and understand it i enjoy the language the themes the pacing but for me little women was never interesting were there  daughters in the book i wouldnt really know i read the dialogue and could care less which of the  was actually speaking i found myself experiencing cognitive dissonance and not willing to reread for my disengaged brain the words and paragraphs my eyes cursored over reflexively  let me see if i can take this apart piece by piecefor my own records  characters they were generic and flat they were cloyingly sentimental almost maudlin the  girls were wholesome almost perfect the parents even more so the girls grew and learned and applied every life lesson to the betterment of their own lives as young women the familyagainst overwhelming demographics of the erawas financially secure but lived well within their means and participated in volunteer work for those less fortunate the father was away at war got wounded almost died in hospitalization at dc and returned to the family not jaded not scarred no he returned jubilant and skipped no beats to resume his role as sage caregiver to his girls and devoted wife bottom line here characters are not plausible despite the death of daughter  there is no reallife underbelly to these characters  plot uninspired there was no denouement there was no struggle at least none that left the scars which we humans all wear the story was split into  parts separated by  years fine but then near the end suddenly  years were rolled up seamlessly within a set of paragraphs everyone ended up as a character on the television series the little house on the prairiehappy contented hopeful hale and smiling bottom line here the story took place in what seemed like an overly contrived hermeticallysealed environment like an unused aquarium  language nothing special louisa may alcott reached a larger audience with her simple words and sentences but there was nothing especially memorable or profound about her prose  themes nothing complex alcotts purpose was to capture an essence of the simple semirural life of young women young women like boys they feel pretty they gossip innocently they cherish their elders and they pray for marriage okay but alcott with little women had nothing on her peers that were producing complex compelling stories of the era the bronte sisters harriet beecher stowe susan fenimore cooper mathilde blind emerson melville thoreau james holmes twain bottom line here themes were developed as expectedsimple commonplace themes that could be read by the masses  this book was written for young women by a young woman for young women to that extent it was a mass market success of the multiplatinum caliber but for me this timepiece ditty grew longer and longer the more i read like a telescopic lens throwing the end farther and farther away i found myself well on the way to the land of nod it purchased no traction in my brain i think little women is overrated and suffered a harsher judgement from me than it probably should have cest la vie i cant imagine if this book was assigned for my english class in high school good gracious so why would i recommend it because it is a mile marker in american literature and just like movie of the year even if its not your thing you probably oughta experience it i enjoyed the abridged version as a kiddo i was excited to have a paperback copy of the real deal finally for cheap and i cant plow through this right now life is too short and i cant stand reading these young girls whine and complain about vanity so so much the story may be uplifting and good and endearing but i cant do it right now its just annoying i received this book a few years back as a present from my grandmother along with a copy of inkheart i love inkheart this not so much after various moves across the country i no longer own either book and that makes me rather sad because they were rather handsome hardbacks  well in actuality i couldnt care less about losing little women i wish i still had inkheart as i love almost everything cornelia funkes ever written but i cant force myself to like little women  now im an atheist but that doesnt mean i cant read christian literature with an open mind i like the chronicles of narnia and i dont like his dark materials and the christianity in little women didnt bother me at all  nor did i mind the characters they were just as bland and one dimensional as the pensive children in fact id say the march sisters are more interesting than peter lucy edmund and susan  and the writing i thought it was pretty good sometimes i wish i could write like louisa may alcott in a way her prose reminds me of frances hodgson burnetts and i love the secret garden as well as the little princess in fact ive read the secret garden six or seven times alas im also missing my paperback copy of that i will need to raid my bank account and hit up amazon to fix my book collection  so now i know youre wondering then whats the problem cory you shouldve loved it  my problem was the storyline granted i read this book when i was eleven or twelve but i have a brilliant memory and no matter how much i liked certain elements of the book i couldnt get down with the story i suppose i should follow the individual storylines first as there are four of them  and before i begin yes i realize that its unfair to judge this book in a modern context but ive seen this book hailed as feminist and empowering yeah no i prefer anne of green gables   meg  in all honesty megs storyline didnt bother me that much that is until she married john  i dont have a problem with housewives i think women should have the choice to become one if they so choose meg didnt have a choice and when she became one she didnt seem content she popped out babies for john and cleaned his house their relationship didnt seem fair and it certainly didnt seem like they loved each other  i dont know what kind of feminist message that sends off im not even going to analyze it  if meg was a pensive shed be susan shes punished for being vain and has no talent worth speaking of honestly i found her pretty irrelevant to the main plot whats the message of her storyline be subservient to your husband   beth  to be honest im kind of an idiot when i was eleven guess what i thought beths secret was i thought she was a lesbian um no not quite  her secret she was dying or something like that i think i might be too dumb to get the deep message surrounding her sainthood by jo i did like her bit with the baby but other than that her storyline was slow  in addition beth didnt really have a talent unless loving people counts as a talent did she sew perhaps but this was never shown to be a productive talent she didnt open a business sew for the poor or anything like that nope i believe she died and turned into an angel   amy  believe it or not i liked amy i found her storyline quite humorous in fact id have rather this book been told from her and jos pov with a realistic non christian slant then this wouldve been brilliant in fact it couldve been up there with the bell jar  starting with the pickled limes and ending with her marriage to laurie i didnt have a problem with amy sure she was a brat but she had flaws and she was somewhat independent as a woman in that time period going off to paris to become a painter was rather impressive even philip in of human bondage had difficulty achieving that   jo  jo right before meg sums up my dissatisfaction with this book because she had such potential a tomboy during the civil war and shes a writer sign me up for that  sadly while jos story delivered during the first half i was greatly disappointed by two events in her life  a her complete dismissal of laurie and the fact that he like jacob black comes back to her as a brother no less and their friendship automatically resumes i thought bad ya love triangles started up in the s apparently not  b her marriage to that old dude i dont understand why that was necessary to continue her writing career to have raunchy old dude sex alright that wasnt called for still it felt kind of random especially to my elevenyearold mind i was ready to throw the book across the room when jo announced their engagement  i dont have a problem with maydecember romances i do have a problem with rushed romances that are used to force an independent character into a marriage because for whatever reason the author decided to write up a quick love triangle  i dont mind laurieamy but i wouldve preferred jolaurie or joalone she refused his offer because she wanted to pursue her writing she wanted to become financially independent and defy marmee who i abhorred for various reasons  sure she said theyd always argue and whatnot but the purpose of this book the christian morals and all that was to show that you could overcome your flaws jos flaw was her temper marrying laurie and overcoming that wouldve been best dont you think apparently alcott thought otherwise giving up your life long dream and becoming the wife of an old dude is what all young women should aspire to  two stars but i will check out the movie i cant help myself i love kidkirsten dunst winona ryder little women more like belittled women   i dont care what anybody says no one would be able to in good conscience give this book anything above a  stars without being internally sexist i understand some might argue that this book was written in a different time entirely to which i would answer  in my opinion morals arent situational and  by the way the author starts off the book describing the girls original plans and aspirations especially joes we can see that even back then such notions of independence freedom and diverse ambitions were a possibility for women of that era but it was alcotts intention to villainise such notions and to paint the role of the docile homely little wife whose lifes duty is nothing more than to cater to her man as the ideal role for any girl to strive to fill  the second major annoying point was how much they romanticized poverty i understand not making or planing your entire life around money but the way the narrator made everything a lesson on how awful money was and what a virtue poverty is made me so frustrated the narrator seemed obsessed with money while preaching too hard on how amazing poverty was  and no fuck you author poverty is never a virtue   the sexism and misogyny drip
"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",i sat down to this book prepared to be captivated in its pages but i was disappointed i was always expecting that finally the author would show her genius and knock me off my feet but it never happened yes it was exciting and entertaining but it wasnt a truly great book  i could not stop comparing this to fahrenheit  by ray bradbury like fahrenheit  it was a dystopian novel set in the future but fahrenheit  had significant symbolism on every page paragraph and even half the sentences i was so scared because it was so lifelike and realistic i could see how undeniably prophetic bradbury was and how we are slowly ever so slowly slipping closer and closer to that world i saw the similarities of the worlds i felt inspired to stop us from falling into that trap too  but the hunger games never provoked me to think or inspired me to act it was like a rollercoaster you get on and momentarily take an exciting spin but thats all youre just taken there youre not drawn in you dont have to do anything you just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working thinking puzzling imagining the writing style wasnt even good and the grammar was actually quite poor what really annoyed me about the writing style was that i knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen just the way that suzanne collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack  i ended up asking so what she could have awoken the reader to real problems by showing us what could happen if we dont take action but she never really got to the point she focused instead on entertaining us on giving us a sob story there was so much potential in this book what im trying to say is that there was so much that suzanne collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like fahrenheit  but she just didnt  i do want to read the next book though ill take another ride on the rollercoaster ehhh im not too emotionally attached to this series but i can see why its popular  this is another one of those amazing books thats feminist without shoving it in your face my general reaction to feminist fantasy is something like girl i dont care how good you are with a sword just dont be an idiot please because they seem to twist feminism around into something that is definitely not feminist i hate the message that only masculine girls are strong why do i have to scorn dresses and hate on other girls to be a feminist  katniss on the other hand is concerned first and foremost with survival shes selfish in a way i think a lot of modern novels shy away from and she actually knows what shes doing i feel like i shouldnt be surprised by this but i am she doesnt get all sappy when shes stuck with peeta bread she keeps her eyes on the prize surviving as best she can  even peeta was a pretty good character he didnt have much of a personality but i found myself warming to him towards the end  there were some parts i didnt like such as the very cheesy death scene but im willing to overlook a few things  katnisss robotic behavior and straightforward thoughts the bland side characters and the unrealistic setting  because this book is so iconic and definitely inspired a whole generation of novels  buddy read with this one we were definitely radiating chaotic energy her flawless review is linked here great read an amazing and entertaining story that even represented the moviefilms to a t paperback  first of all before i begin reviewing this book i just wanted to say how glad and happy i am to be able to review again after such a long time  college assignments have been pretty hectic lately and hopefully ill graduate from the university this year so i think i wont be as active as i usually was but i still usually check goodreads a couple of times in a week  i actually have finished reading this book back in december  but i didnt have the time to review it until now so heres what i think of this book  i still remember years ago while i was in junior high school and i watched the movie adaptation of this book i still remember how i loved it and my adrenaline was pumped throughout the movie and luckly i barely remember anything when i started to read this book nearly a month ago it was not as amazing as i expected but it wasnt bad either it was good actually but not amazing  the plot was honestly so intriguing it was slow but it wasnt necessarily boring but i would be happy if the pacing of the book were much faster and this comes from a person who loves slowpaced books but when the actions began wow i was on the edge of my seat most of the time it didnt take me any effort to be engrossed in reading it i followed katniss adventure and it was both exciting and terrifying but unfortunately i cant say the same for the characters  i wanted to love the characters to adore them or at least like them however the truth is i dont love them or hate them i wasnt really excited about katniss or petta i didnt form any kind of attachment to any of them it was a bit frustrating because i wanted to be connected to them but no i didnt feel anything for them and the romance i honestly dont know what to say about it like totally at lost of words right now the only thing that kept me going in reading the book instead of dnfing it was just the plot it was thrilling i dont think ill read the sequels i just dont feel like i want to spend my time reading them but anyway it wasnt entirely a bad book  if you havent read this book and youre curious about it i guess you should give it a try its not the worst book ive ever read but it wasnt such a splendid book either it was okay good enough  thank you for reading and liking this review and thanks for your comments i absolutely love reading and replying peoples comments thanks a lot hope you all have a great day ok so i realize i might be committing career suicide by not gushing from every orifice about the holiest of dystopian holies i almost didnt write this review because its safer for new authors to just keep their heads down and say nothing because they might piss somebody off but this world has enough liars already  i liked the hunger games there were parts of it that were genuinely excellent but would i name my firstborn daughter katniss negative ghost rider the pattern is fullafter i first put down this book i really genuinely loved it but on closer reflection the things that bugged me remained while the things i liked seemed to fade and i guess the lasting impressions rather than the fleeting ones are the ones that count  pretty is always nice but give me the goofy girl every time   okay lets move on from that barelyserious diatribe   all the hoopla surrounding the hunger games had me expecting a reading experience so enthralling that it would whip my nipples off well ive still got me nips so was this exciting at all yes as exciting as the build up made it out to be no of course not is it ever by now i should know better than to get too excited about reading a book said to be omggood  however relative to other books the hunger games had maybe a few more moments that kept me chained to it and reading on when i might have stopped but in no way did i get irretrievably wrapped up in it and thats probably because the story of a young girl fighting for her life and falling in love wasnt written with me in mind its appeal is not intended for a middleaged grump  this is a ya novel i had to keep reminding myself of that and excuse its immature voice and some of the writingalthough describing inanimate objects as being heartless gave me a chuckle while the somewhat common use of adverb shortcuts couldnt help but annoy i can see why the hunger games has become popular with teens its a coming of age tale in which the revelation that the real world and the people in it are not always black and white good and evil dawns upon the main character as it eventually does for teens  word of warning i listened to the audiobook version of this as narrated by veteran television actress carolyn mccormick you may have seen her on law and order or one life to live if you ever come across a book narrated by her avoid it like the muthafncking plague mccormick laid on the melodrama thick stressing the last word in what seemed like every sentence go back to the start of this paragraph and lay on a heavy dose of languishing drama and epic intensity to the last word in each sentence and you can see how hit or miss the technique if you can call that technique works and how utterly annoying it is it made me shout your speech pattern sucks for the first time in my life not to beat down on the woman but she also has a babytalk lisp that comes out when she pronounces s th and oo sounds listening to her pronounce juice is pretty funny listening to her for nine hours is not  note i made sure to separate my negative feelings over the audiobook narration from my feelings on the book itself and my star rating reflects that on the one hand the hunger games fits my idea of what story meant back when i was a kid transporting me to  school library c  where mrs greene would read aloud and id go all outerbody floating off into lost in a book world over the two days i read this thing i had that slight bookbuzz between reading sessions better than any booze or drug i know and fess up to sneaking pages in at any and all available intervals at the coffeemachine on the shitter walking the hound etc  on the other hand i found it a book of incredible wasted opportunities my problems here are a few  after such a bold move as taking her sisters place in the hunger games katniss doesnt really have all that much to do she dodges a few magic bullets ill get into that later and makes out with a bakers son but she never really has to do anything she doesnt want to do or perhaps anything that could potentially damage her standing read sales with the books core bookbuying demographic  this thing never lives up to the expectations collins herself has set and katniss rarely has a moment of introspection or reaction  is a spoiler alert necessary has anyone not already read this book  who does katniss kill   a boy who just murdered  yr old rue  cato while hes being slowly tortured to death  the first is easy wildly justified and never given a second thought could collins have spared a single page to either a nice existenzy moment in which katniss became acutely aware that she took away all he has all hes ever gonna have or at least a kind of natural revulsion at the sheer physicality of plunging a knife through flesh and bone and the second is a mercy killing an act of kindness and bravery why create this battle royale scenario only to breeze over the most challenging part it seemed a deliberate attempt to keep things a bit surfacey and transfer all the deep stuff onto a somewhat manufactured love triangle  and as for those magic bullets i suppose its possible to run blindfolded across a busy fivelane highway and avoid getting clipped but its very unlikely and dramatically its stupid its comedy its bowfinger if youre gonna toss katniss into this world milk it goose your reader push it to the brink lady you took the easy way out on the big issues why take the easy way out with your set pieces  lemme examine a single scene to make my point  the penultimate action scene in which katniss rushes out into the opening to get the medicine heres what happens    a knife whisks through the air and slices her forehead now katniss didnt see it coming didnt dodge in the nick of time it just happened to fly by so as to conveniently bloody up her forehead but without instantly transforming her into a drooling vegetable seriously lucky down to the microsecond  micromeasurement lucky but lets move on  seconds later   katniss is pounced by some girl who holds her down and traces a knife over her lips about to plunge the knife in at the very last millisecond shes thrown off ok another down to the micromeasurement save in the same scene  and seconds later   the guy who pulled the girl off is about to kill katniss but again  at the last second  when he learns she was good to rue he lets her go what really this late in the game knowing its kill or be killed he lets her go bc she was sweet to a girl that he wouldve had to kill anyway   sorry maybe any of these elements on their own would be fine but three of em in a single scene a knife that is microseconds from its mark followed by a killer who is microseconds from her mark followed by a killer who has a at the last microsecond change of heart when nearly every set piece plays out like this i gotta say one thing to miss collins diminishing returns diminishing fucking returns  and puhleeze dont take refuge in the argument that its a ya book now look with ya there are wider parameters you can for example be a bit more derivative in that your audience is reading this shit for the first time but why soften your edges why create great hitchcockian scenes of suspense and breadcrumbs only to have them lead up to bayesque michael that is setpieces of luck chance magic bullets and serious muddafuckin boooshit and why downplay the psychological andor moral effects of murder i dont get it  collins seemed almost to have a checklist in terms of catchy story elements and ways to catch hold of the zeitgeist which is not a disparagement shes a great storyteller with a knack for making said story applicable to the contemporary human dilemma society of the spectacle fascism vs liberty etc  and its terrific that kids are reading books about a tough nononsense chick who has a kind of political awakening but collins in this first volume was kinda lazy which is a shame bc she made something pretty special everyones reviewed the hunger games its time someone reviewed the setting specifically mine  i take the book and head to my bed attempting to worm my way in between the edge and my dog who is grumpy and doesnt want to be disturbed im left with about eighteen inches of blanket between him and the edge of the covers so i draw a throw over the exposed parts and start reading i soon find myself lost in imagining the hardscrabble life of district  and wondering if the meateaters katniss refers to outside the fence mean zombies i hope so but im doubtful because otherwise the reviews would have mentioned zombies most reviewers dont just forget to mention something like that in a review if the book has them like vampires they are hard to ignore so she probably means cougars and such oh well still note to self look out for meat eaters  katniss has just the sort of selfreliance and composure i love to see in a character i understand her anger at her mother although i sigh a little at yet another female who has an oedipus complex i am glad that prim is used to humanize her even if it is a tried and true technique i find myself interested in buttercup the antagonistic illnamed cat still my own canine buttercup isnt budging despite my attempts to gradually use my leg as a wedge to drive him further toward the middle of the bed im getting colder since the throw isnt compensating for the house cooling since it is late and im cold i decide a hot bath would be just the setting for the next stage of the journey  alas while the water is satisfactorily warm to start with it never reaches the truly steaming temperature that is worth a prolonged soak i try to read quickly leaving the district headed toward the capitol and the wider world in this postapocalypic setting is becoming clear as well as collins starting to detail revolutionary underpinnings still its subtle and i rather like that in a book especially a teen one the city setting is unsurprising although it seems like quite a tech contrast from the districts and the connection katniss develops with the understated stylist cinna is warming i wonder if he is supposed to be referencing a realworld designer except all the ones ive heard of seem quite flamboyant i wonder if collins is trying to say something about character in the city it is here immersed in rapidly cooling water that i wonder a bit if im reading too fast because i find myself hitting more areas that i dont think collins explained and i find it a little odd when katniss suddenly drops these bits of knowledge for the reader except why does she seem clueless at times but despite running more water the bathwater isnt getting much warmer so i cant be bothered to go back and reread to see if i missed some subtle hint im a little irritated from being chilled so its time to get out before i start picking further at the story  changed into pajamas dogs sprawled on the bed but with a spare third left for me i weasel my way under the covers and nudge a dog aside the contestants have entered the arena poised in their metal circles the writing is done well enough to give a sense of place and yet pull action forward the firewall unleashed by the gamemasters seems a bit unfair and reminds me of insert any reality show here but it reminds me i have a heating pad in the bed so i turn it on to warm me up faster the action in the arena is captivating and is isnt until katniss is hallucinating that i realize i am also experiencing a bit of doublevision my new bookshelf arrived yesterday and it didnt get more than a day to air out before i impatiently hauled it inside spending a number of happy hours rearranging my books unfortunately it had been so tightly wrapped that the stain hadnt really finished outgassing and i was starting to get headachey as katniss tried to recover i decided timing was right for my own move besides i knew she would surviveits a trilogy i turned on the ceiling fan and headed to the living room where there was a nice thick comforter and couch just waiting for me  wrapped up in the comforter i prepared to finish the book i liked the way collins gradually brought about katniss political awakening using rue was a particularly smart move that helped it feel organic with character and story no zombiesi dont think although that appears to be a question for another time i certainly understand complaints about the nature of the games and how collins wrote herself a number of very easy ways out of a truly ethically ambiguous situation and i confess that goes against my story preference i find myself agreeing with jocelyns emphasis on the story as a fairy tale still in that context it was enjoyable and wellpaced if not riveting  and after all i was finally warm snug in the feather comforter with only hands and head exposed  three and a half warm stars may the odds be ever in your favor  in the ruins of what was once north america the cruel and tyrannic empire of panem is preparing for the th annual hunger games gladiatorial fights where youths from all twelve outlying districts are forced into killing each other in an arena as punishment for a forgotten rebellion  there is something strangely compelling about the tale of katniss everdeen a poor girl from the poorest of the twelve district and her journey to the capitol as a tribute for the hunger games after volunteering for the games to save her younger sister she embarks on a journey that will take her through the constant fear of death and the fiery passion of love both wrapped around each other this is one of the most famous tales of our time and to some extent there is a reason for it  but i have a confession to make here sometimes you have to go against your most established principles even though you would prefer to stick with them i have been thinking about this since i was in the middle of reading the hunger games and i am still not sure about it but i am going to say it anyway the movie was better than the book  still i cannot escape the notion that this opinion was caused by the terrible decision to watch the movie without having read the book first this is something i would only have done if i had no intentions of reading the book at all and to be honest that was the case here i had written off this series completely and i did not think i would ever end up reading it so when i came home late from work one night and noticed that the movie would be shown on tv in  minutes i thought why not watch it its not like ill ever read the book so i ended up watching the whole thing enjoyed it a lot more than i had expected and after that experience decided to give the books a chance after all  this is definitely a plotdriven novel and that made it a rather disappointing experience to read while knowing practically everything about the plot plotwise there are very few differences between the book and the movie those few being relatively unimportant scenes from the book which have been cut in the movie  the other aspects of the book are not particularly impressive the writing is mediocre with a present tense first person narrative which was not good at all the characters are interesting enough but suffers from comparison with the brilliant acting in the movie where in my opinion the characters were actually heavily improved because of all this i get the feeling that the book relies on the plot as its only major strength and that the same plot is amazing enough to take the readers attention away from the books flaws  the only reason why i am giving this three stars is because it seems unfair to rate it based on a comparison with the movie adaptation while praising that movie to the skies i would probably give it five stars suzanne collins has done a brilliant job of creating a captivating tale in a really interesting dystopian setting so i will stick with this rating even though i am a bit disappointed and instead expect more from the next couple of books  that said i also feel the need to state that i did enjoy the book too it is an astonishing novel which has put its mark on fictional literature and i do not regret having read it it also raises a lot of questions that i would really like to find the answers to and i can only hope that collins has managed to complete that task in the sequels  if you are one of the  people who have not yet read this book i would definitely recommend it but i would also urge you to read it before watching the movie if you have already watched the movie skip it now this is a bit worrying  there are a few young adult fiction bestsellers that i have managed to ignore despite my highly exposed profession i always knew they would catch up with me at some point but somehow i figured harry would come and get me before katniss did  for professional reasons however the hunger games will now enter my repertoire and let me just say that the prejudices i carry with me into this reading adventure are a heavy load really heavy bmi over  obese kind of prejudice  the fact that i liked the first page hasnt changed that so here we go who would have thought i am reading the hunger games it cant be worse than my imagination of it first welcome to reading im glad this could be one of  books you read this year along with the help please stick around there are many more worlds to explore and adventures to have but im glad peer pressure can at least get you to read something i know this is super elitist im sorry but i dont like pop music either and this is the katy perry of the literary world i know reading is always good blah blah blah its still a good book blah blah youre kind of being a jerk here i know but does anyone feel the same sometimes  this is my review from a couple years ago forgot to post it here from the blog  i have this obsession and i know it drives my wife nuts but i cant stand wasting time thats why audiobooks are by friends anytime im driving taking the bus walking to school its all good bookreading time its all forward progression especially since i usually have goals to read so many books a month quarter year etc and ive found that most libraries have a decent selection of audiobooks since they tend to be a bit pricey  now getting to the review im terrible with peer pressure i know everyone else seems to be reading this series and then i found it in the library from there it was settled im still impressed ive resisted the twilight fad for this long  goodreads blurb  in a future north america where the rulers of panem maintain control through an annual televised survival competition pitting young people from each of the twelve districts against one another sixteenyearold katnisss skills are put to the test when she voluntarily takes her younger sisters place  i came really close to giving up on the hunger games book  of  after the first few cds it was really frustrating how subservient these people are who live in each of the districts theyre on the brink of starvation the rulers make it illegal to go hunting although thats one place they actually break the rules they cant say anything remotely seditious against the ruling class and to top it off they send two kids from each of their districts to compete in a game where they have to kill each other off  the winner is the one who outsurvives the rest  the book explains that no one fights back because the elusive district  was utterly decimated but seriously people who are starving anyway have nothing to lose a quick death by decimation is much better than slowly wasting away not only that you have the parents who would continue to let their children go off to fight to the death and not do something about it or at least just not be so submissive to everything  the kids arrive at the compound where they train and get ready for the games and yet again they are completely afraid to break any rules and yet again what do they have to lose theyre about to go try to kill each other why dont they do something this is somewhat explained away because sponsors can help you throughout the game by sending you things you need and theyll only do that if they like you and youre in compliance with the rules  yet i couldnt help but think that people would still be fighting back but anyway once i got over these couple niggles i did i promise the hunger games was a fairly enjoyable read  collins has created an interesting futuristic world where the ruling class keeps the people under their firm grasp by subjecting them to the horrible atrocities that are the hunger games i thought she did a great job showing the intrigue of the games  that they were about more than just whos the biggest strongest fastest  once the hunger games themselves began i was sucked in the game designers plan a number of surprises and tricks to not only weaken the players but to bring them together whatever gives the most entertainment for the legions of crowds watching the grisly show these were all really interesting and helped to move the plot forward very quickly because i like the insensitive crowd like my entertainment too   almost immediately the players created alliances survivor style and it was interesting to see the dynamic especially since they all knew only one person would live this was done quite well and even created some interesting twists  its interesting to note that the hunger games have been optioned by lions gate films and ill be interested to see the movie you always have to see if they got it right    when should you read the hunger games  when youre in the mood for something light and definitely young adult the hunger games may be the way to go im probably the only one who had the issues i had with the book so dont let that hold you back  as i already watched the movies i knew the story  i didnt want to read them but one day somehow i decided to give it a try it was good im glad i decided to read it though i didnt like the writing style  i didnt care about the main characters the books were still better  im also glad i didnt read this in my teenage years i was sensitive still am but less for this much violence  plot  good  interesting but also cruel in a way i dont really like i mean the author couldve just made the age spectrum a little higher or something  katniss could still be the same age or a bit older you know what i mean at least this aspect in book  it resolved  warning child cruelty blood cold brutality violence  characters  i think my favourite characters are cinna  gale i dont care about katniss or peetah tho they were better than the movies but still  updated after book  katniss was too hothead aggressive  talkskillsaccuses first thinks later  most of the times regrets them  sometimes she just whines she even lies to herself you know as she is the pov character  we directly read her thoughts occasionally it makes sense it is reasonable but sometimes no  though still better than many female protagonists i liked her strong stamina  bravery especially in book   i appreciate she cares for the others sometimes theres dangerous lack of sympathy among female protagonists peetah is too good so i found it unrealistic their relationship was also weird not gonna lie im at the other side of the love triangle  i think if those two would get together that made more sense  world building  dystopian world with differences between districts but it was underdeveloped at some points  it felt kinda like medieval era with tv  phone  train i cant put my problem in the words but something was off maybe this whole hunting mining or treatments with herbs in a future society maybe the choking with fear made it dark  more like a medieval era  written style  first person view of a heroine present tenses not really a fan i guess probably because it implies as if im doing this stuff  i would never act like that or behave this way especially when its narrated with present tenses doesnt feel like a journal or something happened in the past but at least it doesnt seem like a fanfiction the descriptions the occasional backstories proves that the writing style is rich                  idea  the idea was kind of lame  cruel i mean hunger game to make them fear to kill each other really they are just children  in general i like the divergent better in dystopian postapocalypse style  ps i always thought snows first name was cornelius but in updates of the ballad of songbirds and snakes i saw its something like coronavirus hehehe i still dont know the real name its something with crnl  s im gonna call him coronavirus anyway  the hunger games didnt impress me  when im reading a book especially a speculative fiction book the first thing i look for is illogical plot holes i hate them they ruin books for me take death note for instance or even glee they are so full of plot holes and illogical inconsistencies they arent worth my time if the author was too lazy to do a bit of research why should i invest myself in their work  that is how i feel about the hunger games  sure the writing isnt bad i guess katniss could be considered a strong female character she kept it together and didnt freak out she was tough and resilient but sometimes you want more than that i like snark i like humor i like cynicism i know there isnt a place for that in most dystopian novels but you have to make me love the characters you have to give them some heart look at the animorphs we had humor and science i think thats the thing most serious writers miss out on  but i digress i started the hunger games with high expectations i thought it would be mind blowing  it wasnt  anyone whos read octavia butler or philip k dick wont be impressed sure its ya but honestly is that an excuse for lazy world building  panem is the remnants of the us divided into thirteen districts the entire political and economical situation of panem is highly illogical this is my problem with avatar the last airbender when you try to make sense out of the world nothing fits then youre told that youre looking too hard into things that its a fantasy world sure its a fantasy world but we still have rules if this were and alien world with an alien culture maybe id agree but this is still earth last time i checked they were still human  during slavery times in the us slaves were looked at as less than human now i know the people of panem arent slaves so why are they following this system in santa domingo the people were enslaved and forced to work for  years they didnt have the freedom the people of panem have they rebelled and after  years or so they won they had to fight again and again but they maintained their freedom from the french those people are the haitians of today  lets look at any civil war situation on the globe the closest situation i can think of is in southern africa there children are forced to fight in wars and carry guns they kill each other there they have their hands cut off if they refuse to fight did i mention that theyre also in a complete system of disarray i dont believe that americans can safely travel there why
The Hobbit,some books are almost impossible to review if a book is bad how easily can we dwell on its flaws but if the book is good how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work  the hobbit is at one level simply a charming adventure story perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told there see how simple that was if you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable at some level there is little more to say enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces thats enough  but if it was only simple entertainment i do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book instead this simple childrens story resonates and fascinates it teases and hints at something larger and grander and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing lecturing or being condescending  at its heart the complaint i opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations tolkien makes in the hobbit when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof how often has that idea fascinated me  consider also how the story opens with bilbos breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit and gandalfs continual meditation on the meaning of good morning how much insight is concealed within gandalfs gentle humor how often do we find ourselves like bilbo saying something we dont really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning how often do we find ourselves saying i dont mean to be rude but when in fact we mean i very much mean to be rude and here it comes if we did not mean to be rude surely we wouldnt say what we say instead we mean im going to be rude but i dont want you to think im someone who is normally rude or im going to put myself forward but i dont want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant or even im going to be rude but i dont want to think of myself as someone who is rude so im going to pretend im not being rude  i think that is what makes this more than just a good book but a great one tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or selfloathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings  we fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form and we have for as long as weve had recorded literature our comic books are filled with those neopagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to whatever else may be true of them beats people up good these modern ajaxs helens and achilles dominate the box office and i would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well oh sure the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt attract the opposite sex and enforce their will upon others but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility how different is tolkiens protagonist from heracles lancelot beowulf or batman  short small mundane and weak of all the principal characters of the story he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute  martial prowess  and yet he is not actually merely an average joe bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as heracles its just that those attributes in which bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isnt the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves bilbo is gentle he is simple he is humble power and wealth have little attraction for him he is kind he takes less than his share and that that he takes he gives away he is a peacemaker though wrongly imprisoned he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him rather he apologizes for stealing food and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took though mistreated he harbors no enmity he never puts himself forward but he never shirks when others do  how often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero and yet how much better we would be if we did how much better off would we be if we like thorin could declare in our hearts there is more in you of good than you know child of the kindly west some courage and some wisdom blended in measure if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world how often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things what profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to beat people up good what real use could we put it too how much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with bilbos virtues rather than achilles speed strength and skill with arms how much less mature does this mere childrens book of a well litworld cause our darker fantasies to seem  now i admit i am biased in my review i read this book  times before the age of  i broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading yet in my defense i will say that im considered only a moderate fan of the book by many ive known several devotees of the book who like the protagonist of bradburys fahrenheit  can recite whole chapters from memory  ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the worlds technology if only the worlds story tellers survived if you are inclined to think no book can be that good and that my review overhypes it so much the better go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded forget all i have said save that if you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable books exist in time and place and our experience of them is affected by the specific time and place in which we encounter them sometimes an uplifting or inspiring book can change the path of a life that has wandered onto a wrong course sometimes a book discovered early on can form part of the foundation of who we are or discovered late can offer insight into the journey we have taken to date sometimes a book is just a book but not the hobbit not for me in january  i pulled out my fortyyear old copy in anticipation of seeing the recently released peter jackson film it is a substantial book heavy not only with its inherent mass but for the weight of associations the sediment of time the book itself is a special hardcover edition published in  leather bound in a slipcase the booty of new love from that era the book while victim to some internal binding cracks arent we all is still in decent shape unlike that longvanquished relationship not surprising i had read the story six times and been there and back again with this particular volume five there are some days when i actually think that the humble hobbit is superior to its bohemoth brother the lord of the rings  its a much tighter story and bilbo is a much more appeal character than is frodo i also just love this poem from the hobbit  far over the misty mountains cold to dungeons deep and caverns old we must away ere break of day to seek the pale enchanted gold  the dwarves of yore made mighty spells while hammers fell like ringing bells in places deep where dark things sleep in hollow halls beneath the fells  for ancient king and elvish lord there many a gleaming golden hoard they shaped and wrought and light they caught to hide in gems on hilt of sword  on silver necklaces they strung the flowering stars on crowns they hung the dragonfire in twisted wire they meshed the light of moon and sun  far over the misty mountains cold to dungeons deep and caverns old we must away ere break of day to claim our longforgotten gold  goblets they carved there for themselves and harps of gold where no man delves there lay they long and many a song was sung unheard by men or elves  the pines were roaring on the height the winds were moaning in the night the fire was red it flaming spread the trees like torches blazed with light  the bells were ringing in the dale and men looked up with faces pale the dragons ire more fierce that fire laid low their towers and houses frail  the mountain smoked beneath the moon the dwarves they heard the tramp of doom they fled their hall to dying fall beaneath his feet beneath the moon  far over the misty mountains grim to dungeons deep and caverns dim we must away ere break of day to win our harps and gold from him what makes the hobbit such a seminal work in the fantasy genre is it the nine hours of overbudget sensorially explosive movies by peter jackson nope is it a complex tale of multiple human kingdoms slaughtering each other for an iron throne with buckets of blood and guts and plenty of sex nope is it simply wonderful writing as simple and boring as that does that mean that i was incredibly disappointed in the movie adaptation not to say abortion yep does that mean i dont love game of thrones books and tv shows no they are great too but the seminal work the divine comedy that created the language and inspiration for george rr martin as dante created italian from the common vernacular in florence and ravenna was the hobbit the book even for a slow reader is most likely able to be finished in  the time that peter jackson spent telling the story in mm film unlike peter jacksons version there are no orcs and the element of danger is more psychological than psychical bilbo baggins is battling his fears and his provincialism and growing up the hobbit should be read as the odyssey of middle earth  a voyage of selflearning and maturation that is more about the monsters in bilbos imagination than those encountered in his baptismal voyage into the unknown with gandalf gandalf honestly would there ever have been a dumbledore had there not been a gandalf did any tolkien reader not picture gandalf when rowlings talked about dumbledorf in the first harry potter book  bilbo does encounter some monsters and even outsmarts smaug the dragon wow i mean what a perfect name for a dragon more evocative than drogon rhaegal and viserion in my opinion  and again would they even have existed had smaug not preceded them and he saves middle earth before returning to the shire he is not the same person he was before leaving he is ulysses without a penelope waiting for him unless his pipe is secretly called penelope in his expanded imagination or his penelope is a symbol of his vast library in rivendell  in literature there is nothing quite like the hobbit in its simplicity and beauty and its symbolic voyage we are of course introduced to the elves the humans the dwarvesbut they are all on the outskirts of the story the hobbit is about one small hobbit fighting his greatest fearsand winning  k followers  follow july   book  from  books  the hobbit  there and back again jrr tolkien  the hobbit or there and back again is a fantasy novel by english author j r r tolkien it was published on  september  to wide critical acclaim being nominated for the carnegie medal and awarded a prize from the new york herald tribune for best juvenile fiction the book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in childrens literature  gandalf tricks bilbo baggins into hosting a party for thorin oakenshield and his band of dwarves who sing of reclaiming the lonely mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon smaug  when the music ends gandalf unveils thrrs map showing a secret door into the mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded bilbo serve as the expeditions burglar  the dwarves ridicule the idea but bilbo indignant joins despite himself  the group travels into the wild where gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to rivendell where elrond reveals more secrets from the map when they attempt to cross the misty mountains they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground  although gandalf rescues them bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins lost in the goblin tunnels he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters gollum who engages him in a game of riddles  as a reward for solving all riddles gollum will show him the path out of the tunnels but if bilbo fails his life will be forfeit  with the help of the ring which confers invisibility bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves improving his reputation with them the goblins and wargs give chase but the company are saved by eagles before resting in the house of beorn  hit the road bilbo and better dont smaug no more  a short piece for kids ready to unleash its full potential without its and cs lewiss impact on tolkien there may have been no lotr just imagine how empty the nowadays fantasy world could look like but at least its not  as complex as the silmarillion  holy heck this thing was a mind blowing complex interwoven totally over my little nerd brain behemoth of a book truly hardcore stuff if youre into that some purists may argue that the hobbit is too simplified but again its a freaking book for kids i just dont get the people ordering pizza at the golden arches drive in and then complaining and wanting to talk to the manager reading karens are just ridiculous   would be a bit over the top to see a deeper allegory regarding greed and power in smaug but its always a nice move to show kids the problems with endless exponential shiny growth until there is no gold left anymore there definitively is an equivalent of this concept in the pure endless exponential evil growth concept in lotr and one could take another controversial step and ask who morgoth the prime minister or ceo sauron an important minister or cdo and saruman an overachieving higher bureaucrat or rayon manager could be in st century real life im not just joking im really often thinking  about the manifestations of evil in different genres and reality see how hidden it is in this short piece opening the just potential for many kids to later ask what it could have meant and for everyone else to look at herhis society and point at the darkest crudest unfolding potential in the worst case this is not just political terror mixed with theocracy witch burning but garnished with a stupid self destructive economic system ruining everything at least privileged western people like me just have the ethical problem of choosing the favored luxury consumer goods from the top of piles of corpses and natural destruction caused in some place nobody knows i just dont know which k  inch tv i should buy and if i should spend my vacation in the mountains or by the sea however  why should anyone handle tolkien the nobel prize for literature just because he founded one of the greatest literary genres ever so better give it to another sophisticated intellectual who probably  i havent read any ivo andric   is so over the top work to read that its just exhausting but im biased regarding nobel price and snobby classic literature so ill better stop complaining about things im too lazy to read and that just arent fun but even often pretty downers too but its still funny that nobody reads all this nobel price stuff fantasy and sci fi never were allowed to enter and still became the most inspiring literature to rule them all  tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique  sean barrs  reviews k followers  follow may   andy serkis is doing a live reading of this right now for charity  to call this the epitome in which all high fantasy should be judged does not quite suffice this is simply one of the best books that has ever been written or will ever be written the hobbit defines the high fantasy genre along with its sequel of course and has been an inspiration to countless authors and readers alike tolkien quite literally kick started a genre that would eventually capture the hearts of thousands of people he changed the literary world he made fantasy real  the best fantasy universe ever created  description  middle earth is undoubtedly the best fantasy universe created it is the most original and richly devised it is very hard for fantasy authors not to borrow elements from tolkien he set the definition with his wonderful world tolkiens references to modern day are also very amusing and almost unnoticeable in the brilliant narrative but a perceptive reader will notice the whimsical contrasts he has drawn between his world and the real world the sheer depth of tolkiens imagination is really unmeasurable i wonder what other ideas for books he may have had that he never got to write  the road goes ever on and on  bilbo like the reader is blown away by the breathtaking landscape of middle earth we must remember that he too is experiencing the majesty of rivendell and the mightiness of erabor for the first time his reaction reflects a reader who is also awestruck by a world that is as beautifully magical as it is corrupt and wicked it is a world in which both the benevolent and the malignant reside it is a world whose people are capable of both great kindness and equally as great cruelty the peoples are diverse and contrasting i think the differences between the elves and the dwarves are best captured in their music the music of the elves is full of mirth and is generally quite playful whereas the music of the dwarves is strong deep and full of resolve to match their stubborn nature  the wonderful wonderful story  description  this story belongs to bilbo baggins this is something i think peter jackson would do well to remember but thats beside the point the tale begins as bilbo accidently unexpectedly invites gandalf for tea the next day after a brief encounter the wizard marks him as the fourteenth member of his company his burglar bilbo doesnt really understand what he is getting himself in for when he agrees to join their mission indeed the next evening thirteen dwarves headed by thorin oakenshield arrive along with their quest to reclaim their gold and slay a dragon smaug smaug has stolen their home fortress of erebor they want it back bilbo reluctantly gets dragged along though this reluctance is quickly overcome by a strong secret desire for adventure  i am looking for someone to share in an adventure that i am arranging and its very difficult to find anyone i should think so  in these parts we are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures nasty disturbing uncomfortable things make you late for dinner  the story becomes darker as they close in on the mountain the company are attacked by spiders and abducted by the wood elves who want a share of the dwarfish treasure the dwarves begin to rely on their burglar who they believed would become a liability how wrong they were bilbo was destined to come along they would have surely failed if he had not and the ring of power may never have been destroyed but thats another wonderful story the game of riddles and the finding of the ring is one of the more memorable scenes of the book and is bilbos gateway into heroism i think the power he receives from the ring helps him to discover that not only does he have courage and fortitude but he has lots of it gandalf if anything is an excellent judge of character  the ending is just the beginning  description  the ending of this book is undeniably rushed bilbo is unconscious for most of it and we receive a post battle update there are off page deaths and victories in this i think tolkien cements the message of the story it is not about the tragic death of a dwarf who went slightly mad and then redeemed himself it is not about a boatman who slayed a dragon and became a renowned hero it is about a hobbit this is bilbos story and no others it is a story in which a hobbit who had no courage and no bravery found it it is a story about a hobbit who was too scared to leave his house without a hanky eventually evolved into a hobbit that would trick a dragon  you have nice manners for a thief and a liar said the dragon  from a hole in the ground came one of my favorite characters of all time the very reluctant and unassuming hero bilbo baggins  as a child the hobbit sparked my young imagination causing wonderful daydreams and horrible nightmares as a teen the book made me want to become a writer of fantastical talesor go shoeless live in a hole and smoke a pipe as an adult tolkiens novel maintains within me a link to my childhood safekeeping cherished memories and evoking everlasting emotions  the troubles with trolls those slinking spiders the finding of treasure cave exploration riddles in the darkit all added up in me a love for adventure i would make many an ornate wooden sword in my fathers basement workshop because of sting funny i didnt take to wearing rings though  being pintsized mr baggins makes the perfect magnetic character for a young person he is about a childs size yet he is mature similar yet something to aspire to his diminutive stature made his implausible escapes and victories that much more satisfying nothing bores me more than musclebound killing machines wielding swords the size of windmill blades  i have read this fantastic tale a number of times watched the s cartoon movie version countless times and was counting down the days with unabashed eagerness until peter jacksons new live action film came out i will continue to read the hobbit again and again for the road goes ever ever on   appendixish type reviews  the hobbit the  animated film version by rankin  bass this may be the movie ive watched the most in my life this is the one i can quote from start to finish and annoy the fuck out of my friends i try to refrain but when john huston bellows out i am gandalf and gandalf means mewell i just cant help myself crazyoffhisrocker brother theodore as gollum still astounds me with the sheer depth of his guttural growl sorry voicestraining serkis but this is the real gollum the creepy muthah that kept me up nights though rankin  basss version skips over the whole beorn scene entirely coming in at  minutes they actually managed to pack in quite a bit of story certainly it is truncated to absurdity during the battle of five armies but at least its not overblown as appears to be happening with peter jacksons unnecessarily long trilogy of this single book  the hobbit or there and back again an illustrated book by rankin  bass though its a few pages shorter than the regular paperback version this marvelous parttext partillustrated version seems to be unabridged it includes screenshots taken directly from the s cartoon plus where the movie skipped over parts of the book theyve included extra illustrations admittedly of mixed quality its a little strange to see the same characters rendered differently sitting side by side descriptiondescription but nonetheless its always fun to see how artists interpret the work especially when its a work dear to your heart  the hobbit a film version by peter jackson its never fun to see an artist tear the heart out of a work peter jackson was given too long a leash when new line stretched this one book out to three separate movies instead of one movie packed with awesome we get three that so far ive yet to see the third and im not eager to have been watered down and dragged out extra scenes are added and add nothing really a sleigh ride chase scene with an incredibly minor character and honestly can richard armitage as thorin oakenshield act with any other part of his body besides his eyebrows in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell nor yet a dry bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat it was a hobbithole and that means comfort  so begins jrr tolkiens love letter to fantasy literature  a reader to this timeless classic will first notice that this is a first person narration the reader hears tolkiens voice as he narrates the tale of bilbo baggins belladonna tooks odd son who though he resembles his respectable and comfortable father has an unexpected adventure in him jrr tolkien is telling us a story with an occasional soliloquy and off stage remark to us the reader  this of course is the charming and entertaining prequel to tolkiens monumental fantasy trilogy the lord of the rings but a fine tale in its own right and by itself generations of readers and dreamers have loved this story for its whimsical allure and for its role as a stage setter for its more epic later cousins  the films readers nowadays have the good fortune of being audience to sir peter jacksons magnificent films but i and many folks of an earlier generation better recall the  bass and rankin animated film with voice talent from john huston orson bean and richard boone this cartoon was my first introduction to tolkiens work and would inspire me to actually read the hobbit and lord of the rings later  thorin the important dwarf and company leave from the green dragon in may accompanied by the wizard gandalf and having employed mr baggins as their lucky number  and as a burglar and bilbos unexpected adventure had begun  i am gandalf and gandalf means me  the significance of gandalf in fantasy literature cannot be overestimated certainly there had been wizards magicians and sages in literature before  but gandalf in many respects is the wizard as fine a performance as sir ian mckellen did in all his films portraying gandalf i still in my mind hear john hustons husky yet urbane voice speaking for him later readers of the lord of the rings and the silmarillion will learn more about the gray wanderer but in the hobbit he is simply gandalf  chapter   riddles in the dark after some fairly pedestrian undertakings tolkien has bilbo getting lost in a deep cave and introduces us to one of his and literatures greastest most complicated and strangely likeable villains gollum later readers would learn the deeper truths of his history but tolkiens guests in this chapter see him as a eccentrically troubled scoundrel  songs a reader in the twentyfirst century and especially one who has enjoyed the jackson films may be surprised to discover that tolkiens original story was not as martial as the films certainly jackson produced his hobbit films to be less warlike than his epic lotr films but tolkiens prose contained a fair amount of poetry and song casting his story in a more innocent and lyric form than would be palatable in todays publications  i remember trying to convince my high school english teacher that this was deserving of more literary praise and so this was also my first or one of my first indications that many literary folks place an asterisk on the science fiction  fantasy genre when it comes to acknowledging the quality of the writing kurt vonnegut mentioned that as soon as the science fiction label was affixed to his name many critics would not take him seriously  the hobbit is a great example that sometimes critics can be myopic and time will tell the true greats the prologue to a great trilogy simple and charming the hobbit is a great book by itself  finally this review is of a revisit to the hobbit after a hiatus of perhaps  years i rarely will reread a book there are just so many great books and so little time  but the hobbit is one of those special works that can be savored and enjoyed again and again    reread i need to reread this more often professor tolkiens charming storytelling is a soothing comfort for troubled times  this time around i focused on the details that i had missed before and tolkien has provided many some nuanced within his excellent story and other subtle enough to be missed but important spice added to the recipe  its also important to distinguish between the book and the excellent adaptions by peter jackson and the  animated classic by bass and rankin in my memory i sometimes forget what is actual canon and not artistic license i had forgotten that the master of laketown left out of the  film was from tolkien  tolkiens description of the journey is also endearing taking the time to add his nineteenth century sensibilities to the fantasy  if you have never read this work please do i can highly recommend an enjoyable reread to the rest of us a reread in february  been a wonderful read  if more of us valued food cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world thorin oakenshield sums it up when he says these last words to bilbo baggins  the hobbit is the ultimate and an amazing adventure nasty disturbing uncomfortable things in bilbos words story this book is a real delight a mustread  these below lines recited by bilbo are just beautiful  roads go ever ever on over rock and under tree by caves where never sun has shone by streams that never find the sea over snow by winter sown and through the merry flowers of june over grass and over stone and under mountains of the moon  roads go ever ever on under cloud and under star yet feet that wandering have gone turn at last to home afar eyes that fire and sword have seen and horror in the halls of stone look at last on meadows green and trees and hills they long have known just amazing fun and beautiful adventure i had to read the end again because of my love how they made three films out of this impresses me not much more needs to be said about the hobbit than that it is excellent great storytelling fun characters humor action  it has it all tolkien is rightfully one of the if not the founding fathers of modern fantasy if you are already into the fantasy genre and you havent read him you need to if you are looking to get into fantasy the hobbit is a great place to start  one of the great things about the hobbit is that i think it is easily accessible to a wide audience the lord of the rings is a much larger and more daunting commitment which might be too much for the casual fantasy fan then if you are really into lore and world building i hear people talk about the silmarillion as a great but very dense history of middle earth so tolkien has it all fantasy or masters thesis level fantasy  you can decide how you want to approach his works  one thing that has been bugging me about other fantasy novels i have been reading lately is that there is a lot of wandering around without much action or story progress and this wandering around can stretch for several books with the hobbit there is adventure and wandering but it moves quickly and gets to the point large chunks of progress are made without pages and pages of rambling dialogue i appreciate how well the hobbit gets to the point but does not leave you feeling cheated by it going too fast  another thing that i love about this fantasy book is that it does not bog down with complicated names location terminology odd magic systems etc this is another thing that has been turning me off to other fantasy lately because i cannot just escape and enjoy the book instead i have to keep a notebook and a flowchart to keep everything straight with the hobbit it was very organic and easy to follow  perfect for a relaxing fantasy getaway for the brain  i did not yet see the recent movies they made from this book but was surprised at first that they made it into three movies after rereading this i think i can see how they could expand on certain parts to make a movie trilogy i will have to go and check it out now now i dont remember all the names of those  dwarfs but still i can legitimately say i enjoyed the book the hobbit the version rewritten by tolkien is sophisticated enough to please adults and children alike  initially nobody knew how gollum looked like seriously just take a look at the various covers of the book and youll see diverse bodies as gollum the ring acquired by bilbo is so quaint so practical  tolkien weaved his magic here and delivered a timeless classic the adventures of bilbo especially those without gandalf to bail him out are very original i hope the uninitiated dont get deterred by the movie trilogy that would be a tragedy i give this book a perfect five stars now the route mr bilbo baggins transverses to seek adventure and a pot of goldseveral in fact may not be as glamorous as the yellow brick road nonetheless thoroughly lucrativehe will never complainafter he is safely back home as our story begins the hobbit is having a quiet delightful time drinking his tea and a nice breakfast steps out the door from his hole in the ground the unkind would say blows a wonderful smoke ringand is the last one for many moons a peaceful situation i m
Of Mice and Men,i knowclassic movies been around for years greatly respected author etc etc etc but nihilism leaves me cold  enjoy if its youbut and ive used this quote before this book typifies life is hard and then you die who cares how well the story is written that gets you there  the very quality of the writing here made the experience worse for me it has been brought to my attention of late that steinbeck was a gifted writer its true he was and the message in the story he relates here carries that much more weight i suppose the bottom line is i live in the world where pain happens a lot i dont really need it here so i leave my rating as it is because my experience here remains a  star experience so as i said for you who love this book and i know someim happy for you i dont and i cant really recommend it how does one rate a holy tome of english lit when one found the reading experience to be extraordinarily average   nay even subpar  i suppose the real question is am i like some people a vote whore who will slap the big uno on it and then index all the books inadequecies ignoring all the things the author did well this will probably gain my review the most interest  or shall i like a dignified book reviewer give it a trio and calmly explain both its flaws and its high points  uno it is  heres why i thought of mice and men sucked balls   whats up with the main character who has no personality other than being large and like the lame interpretation of frankenstein from the s movie friendlyyetstupid and unawareofhisownstrength superlame   whats up with the other main character who seems to like nothing more than shitting on the big dudes selfesteem and pointing out how much his own life sucks because of his friendship with said stupid friend hes not an orgasmically charming fellow himself in fact hes eeyore   whats up with the most interesting character being in one fraggin chapter i found the black character fascinating and in this one scene he established himself as more intriguing than anyone else in the whole flippin book then we never hear from him again   yet again steinbeck makes the main female character a sultry temptress the way he makes all women into sultry temptresses youd think he had a bible fetish or something shes the least sympathetic character in a book full of characters i didnt sympathize with   im now bored with the numbering system and shall stop doing it  two steinbeck novels have i loved east of eden is one of my very favorite books and the grapes of wrath is also terrific but this reads like a mediocre tennessee williams play and i frikkin hate that guy why it isnt just because of weak characters in this book its also because the whole premise of this book sucks and the ending sucks even more than the premise its a snowball of suckiness culminating in a bang that left me confused yet simultaneously indifferent  perhaps its because similar plotlines have been littered around the modern age like horse shit at a circus but did anybody not know exactly what was going to happen from page  on anyone beuller  get it like   movie reference nevermind  anyway this sucked theres no wishbone episode of thisun and its because a wishbone episode of this wouldve made kids commit suicide its depressing yet depressingly lame as well  and there wasnt one damn mouse in the whole book thats false advertising  im leaving this up for posterity and i really didnt like the book but if i wrote a review today in my s it probably wouldnt be this black and white    i read this for eighth grade english and it convinced me that i never want to read another steinbeck as long as i live i understand that its supposed to convey the desperation of the times and whatnot but this ranks among the most irredeemably depressing books ive ever read everybody starts out miserable and ends up miserable whats the point of that if you want realism read a history book i read fiction because it doesnt operate like the real world thankyouverymuch blatant symbolism makes the reader able to discern exactly what is going to happen and what means what from the getgo there is no surprise or character development just the descent into the inevitable if of mice and men has a million haters then i am one of them if of mice and men has ten haters then am one of them if of mice and men has only one hater then that is me if of mice and men has no haters then that means i am no longer on earth if the world is for of mice and men then i am against the world what you want of a dead mouse anyways i could pet it with my thumb while we walked along said lennie well you aint petting no mice while you walk with me said george  some reviewers are complaining about the lack of mice in the story considering the title granted i only read the first few chapters but most of it was about mice lenny is obsessed with them dashing into bushes to catch them pretending hes collecting wood when hes hunting them dreaming of them his lifes goal is to find miceand copy george  thats about all i learned from the book as i was forced to abandon it due to the abundance of strong language and blasphemy  has anyone else noticed the complete double standards in our education system teachers happy to rebuke children most severely for daring to use this type of language in speech yet promoting and encouraging the study and retention of it in english literature lessons this all because it has been labelled a classic  perhaps youll be lucky enough to find my copy with all the swear words crossed out if not stay away from this you might also want to check that your children arent busily absorbing it in school as the language will undoubtedly find its way into their speech sooner or later its taken me decades to forgive steinbeck for this the grapes of wrath the pearl and the red pony but east of eden made me want to make my peace with the man read  times the first time i read this book in an abridged english version written by another author and gave it  stars a month ago i tried to read it again now in portuguese my native language and with the original text of john steinbeck along with the audiobook this time i liked it even less and i lowered the books rating from  stars to  star i think john steinbecks writing isnt for me i honestly couldnt find one thing i liked about this book why do kids read it in school why do kids have to study the hidden meanings or purposeful metaphors that are said to reside in this book i dont understand the only reason i read this book was because i had to read it for school my english class required it i wish i had never read this why is it a classic after reading it i have absolutely no idea why do kids read it in school i dont know what possesed the people who create the curriculum in my school but it was something evil so here i rant the characters were meaningless and onesided and i couldnt relate to anyonepartly because the majority of them were dull boring and immature men the only woman in the whole story was flirty and rather dimwittedand partly because they were souless and completely fake they didnt seem real yeah they made mistakes and they got in fights and they blamed eachother and they had to try with all their might not to be seduced by a married woman those are all human type things but that doesnt make the characters human the author has to make the characters make mistakes like that and add a little something else which varies for different characters to make the characters seem real and relatable also the length of the book  and im not usually one to complain about length was obscenely short i barely had to time to figure out what the hell was happening with the plot before the book was finished it was a hundredsomething pages of nothing and i regret reading that nothing finally there was little to no character development some could argue that george had to grow up a littlethroughout the story it was a serious let down no one had an attitude adjustment no one had to come to terms with enemies the story was so bland because of it nothing changed in the end the jerks were still jerks the clueless were still clueless and the people who had the potential to be great were still desperate disturbed men who loved no one and were loved by no one its sad but no in the imgoingtoshedatear sad more of the wowthisisextremelypitiful sad the writing also fell flat for me when i read a classic i expect the writing to be superb i expect it to completely blowmysocksoffamazing but it wasnt it was ehh i hate ehh books and this book would be blessed to get an ehh from me i can tell you now its not blessed i wouldnt recommend this book to anyone and i think it was a complete waste of my time to read it whatever this book was trying to achieve i will never understand definitely the worst book ive been assigned for english reading this in school made me dislike this book so much if you dont stop your blubbering ill give you something to cry about  another weepy entry from the greatest master of the underdog since marx  i guess i hate this shit because every underdog i ever met deserved to be an underdog  what underdogs oughta do is actually try to be underdogs then when they fuck that up theyd be something other than underdogs  theres that plus theres am i the only one who isnt already bored to death with crybabies how can you get past the age of  without being tired of crybabies without being a woman i mean of mice and men was not really a good book i got tired f reading i thought it was really boring it was pointless and the action was no where to be found i usually get something out of classics but this book fuckin sucked literally nothing happened if any of yall ever have to write a painful essay on violence in of mice and men youre welcome  the juxtaposition between violence as a merciful act and violence with ill intent can be found in numerous forms of text throughout the years but none can quite capture the same message as john steinbeck does in his novel of mice and men this contrast is most evidently depicted in his novel through the events of curleys wild hunt for lennie the murder of candys dog and lennies death respectively steinbeck effectively demonstrates how violence is simply a tool for the men to manipulate as a way to achieve justice that defines the social hierarchy on the ranch and exposes the harsh reality of a cruel world  steinbeck repeatedly details the needless and indefinite violence of the migrant workers throughout his novel which illuminates a culture of cruelty and destruction that was an essential part of american life during the great depression one of the most prominent and notable uses of violence that can not be mistaken for anything other than an act with merciless intent is curleys desperate hunt for lennie it is beyond question that there is but minimal correlations between the barbarous hunt for lennie and the merciful passing of lennie at the hands of george at first glance the most obvious of these few similarities is the result lennies demise as one would expect the connections between the two end there in spite of curley insisting that his core motivation for the hunt was to get retribution for his dead wife it can be easily distinguished that his real objective was to inflict as much suffering upon lennie as possible as he craved to kill that big sonofabitch himself john steinbeck of mice and men p in contrast to this brutality georges only wish is to mitigate the future and inevitable misery of lennie not induce it another subtle yet just as relevant connection that distinguishes the two events was the mentality of lennie while they took place whilst the humane taking of lennies life by george unquestionably caused him excruciating physical pain there is no doubt that lennie would have been in a tranquil state of mind as during their conversation he repeatedly cried in triumph john steinbeck of mice and men p on the other hand the intentional hunt for lennie although causing him no such physical pain unquestionably bred more fear and distress in him than he would have experienced in losing his life  as it may be the most striking predicament that emphasises the comparison between merciful and merciless violence is none other than the slaughter of candys dog although the manner of both candys dog and lennies death were identicalcarlsons gun to the back of the headthe fundamental objective of the two differ entirely the purpose of lennies death was not to benefit george by any means he only wished to ease lennies suffering as humanely as possible and without humiliation by contrast the ruthless nature of carlson leads one to believe that his intentions may not be as innocent as he originally claimed and he never truly shot the dog to put the old devil out of his misery john steinbeck of mice and men p instead the death of candys dog was to fulfil carlsons own sadistic pleasure this would not be any stretch of the imagination as he seemed to harbour a kind of twisted fantasy at the expense of others this is most obviously depicted when carlson conveyed the impression that he was eager to watch the potential beating of slim by curley and he reveals his complete inability to empathise with george about the death of lennie towards the end of the novel in which he fails to comprehend what the hell  is eatin george and slim john steinbeck of mice and men p on the surface this appears to be the only difference that divides the two but further inspection proves otherwise unlike lennies demise in which george faces the unsettling feeling of numbness the death of candys dog does not trigger remorse nor repentance in the perpetrator as of fact carlson seems indifferent immediately after killing the old dog even going as far to callously clean the gun in candys presence moreover whilst lennie and candys dog were killed in a similar manner the value that society places on the life of a human being versus that of an animal is distinctly different the crime though alike in nature would be punishable by life in prison where a human being is involved this contrasts with an identical crime against an animal that may only carry a term of punishment of several years  what our society now deems as merciful is of an entirely different nature to that in of mice and men hence an inevitable question is raised could george have explored other nonviolent alternatives in regards to alleviating lennies unavoidable suffering george may have considered the shooting of lennie as the only humane action to take yet surely another bloodless route could have been followed such as possibly assisting in stowing lennie away for hopes of a better life elsewhere although it is worth mentioning that george has tried that failed path already as it is exemplified in the main plot of running away from weed and straighter to the ranch a remarkably plausible possibility is that perhaps george was caught up in his own small bubble one of which is filled with violence and corruption and could not see these other obvious nonviolent options in being able to look past his own world of brutality george would have defied the norm for the american culture of cruelty that was so prominent during the great depression the senseless and endless violence in of mice and men portrays a world wherein justice is not brought about by weighing the crimes and integrity of the guilty it is simply bought with fists and rage without mistake each and every character in steinbecks novel illustrates this misconstrued justice as the story unfolds the means of violence as the only choice resembles a barbaric lifestyle and is quite possibly a reflection of that time as it was a dog eat dog type of world  throughout of mice and men john steinbeck details the theme of violence as an unstoppable force that is depicted through the bleak reality of the era in examining the differences and similarities between merciless and merciful violence we not only gain a reliable perspective into the time of the great depression but we can also see firsthand how the repeated acts of mindless violence in a cutthroat world influences the stunted psychological and emotional growth in people within the grim invisible walls of the ranch the migrant workers all slowly yet surely grow so accustomed to malice and failure that they are more than keen to tear down each others dreamand bodiesrather than build them up perhaps violence is the natural outlet for all the ranchs desperation and limited opportunities but it certainly does make for a dismal and sombre place read this for school worst thing ive ever read my eyes need formal apologies when people say hell i think theyre referring to this book burn this book throw it in the deepest darkest parts of hell for all i care send it to purgatory i have never hated a book more than i have hated this one with the exception of the divergent series ofc depressing story set appropriately during the great depression in this story things go from bad to worse until everything goes to pieces ending made me want to jump off a cliff good old steinbeck  he just cant seem to pick up a pencil without spreading sunshine this is also the author of the dead pony i mean the red pony they make kids read stuff like this and then they dont understand why the teen suicide rate is so high what a terrible book to give a ninth grade class i dont think anyone  teacher or student was happy with reading this boring as i dont know what i insist on staying away from steinbeck from now on i have no clue whats going on within the walls of john steinbecks mind and i simply do not want to know maybe everbody in the whole damn world is scared of each other  i think i missed the point of this book im so confused by these fivestar reviews  the main character is bizarrely simple and has no other traits than being large friendly limited and unaware of his own physical strength the other main character spends most of the time bringing down the first ones selfesteem and pointing out how much his own life sucks because of their friendship and its overall pretty depressing in a lame way  i had never before read anything by steinbeck and now im not sure i will maybe its just not for me of mice and men was not really a good book i got tired f reading i thought it was really boring it was pointless and the action was no where to be found i thought it was really really boring a book about two guys that need each other people need each other everyday when it started and it talked about lennie being menatally challenged i thought this book might be ok but when i was reading i just wanted to put the book down the title really was it for me anyway but it was an assignment so i had to do it im am not really a reader anyway so when i read something it has to be really interesting this book was meaningless i found no point in this art work i say this because there wasnt really anything going on ok htere were little things with curlys wife soon as she came around things were so wrong and messed up she caused so much trouble wow the storyline was corny last but not least there was no action there parts in the book where lennie hurt people the part where he crushed curlys hand and when he snapped curlys wifes neck but that is nothing major just as soon as i though something interesting was going to happen it didnt thats just like getting on a kiddie rollercoster you think you are going to go up and drop really fast and scream with excitement but instead its just rides in a circle all the way around its a oh ok instead of a yaaaaayyyyyyyy in conclusion i despise of mice and men it was one of the worst books i ever read the movie was alright but as for the bookits corny its boring and it was no action people want to ban books for fantasy they need to ban this one for being boring it is cruel and unjust punishment and should not be read anywhere i had never read this book so since my daughter was reading it for her th grade english class i decided to read it along with her and wow i just do not understand why this is a classic or why in a school system where they read only a few books as a class this would be one that they chose for such a short book it is painfully slow predictable plus some weird racist and sexist stuff that has not aged well at least my daughter and i enjoyed making fun of it together just finished this for english classit was so terrible i dont understand it at all ok maybe the author was trying to make some point but half of it was so dull and then it finally speed up and what happens lennie dies if it werent for school making me read it i never would have picked this up the style of writing however was tolerable john steinbeck has managed to cram what is possibly the worst book i have ever read in  pages well done mr steinbeck based in the s during a time when jobs were scarce two brothers george and lennie secure a job when terrible mishaps happen with a notsohappy ending the only waterworks i experienced in the book was when i was attempting to either drown myself or the book i dont like depressing writing if i want to be depressed ill just think not read boring boring just because i had to read it in school doesnt make it a classic
Fahrenheit 451,farenheit  has been analyzed and reinterpreted by every successive generation to change its meaning this is chiefly because the book is full of assumptions and vague symbolism which can be taken many ways and rarely does anyone come away from the book with the conclusion the author intended which would suggest that it is a failed attempt  there are grounds to contend that even the title is inaccurate since contemporary sources suggest paper combusts at  degrees celsius which in farenheit would be more than  degrees the truth is paper combustion is gradual and dependent on many factors even if some paper might combust at f his title is at best an oversimplification but bradbury was more interested in a punchy message than in constructing a thoughtful and wellsupported argument  its not a book about book censorship but a book about how tv will rot your brain bradbury himself has stated this again and again as evidenced in this article which quotes bradbury and in videos from bradburys own websiteindeed in an interview he stated he was inspired to write it because he was horrified that a woman might listen to a radio while walking her dog not only does he patronizingly assume that shes listening to a soap opera instead of news or appreciating classical music but its a strangely antitechnology pose for a sci fi writer to takedoes it really matter whether we get our art and knowledge from compressed tree pulp or from radio transmissions  this book falls somewhat short of its satirical mark based on this cranky lawnloving neighbors message then again it was written in the course of a few days in one long uninterrupted slurry mercifully edited by his publishers but now available utterly restored it contains archetypes misconceptions and an author surrogate but can still be seen as a slighting view of authority and power and of the way people are always willing to deceive themselves  unfortunately bradbury did not seem to recognize that reading has always been the province of a minority and that television would do little to kill it more books are written published and read today than at any other point in history most of them are just redundant filler but so is  of any mass creative output books art movies or tv as sturgeon said and theres nothing new about that either cheap trashy novels have been a joke since the victorian  television is a different medium than books and has its own strengths and weaknesses bradburys critique of tvthat it will get larger more pervasive and become an escape for small mindsis just as true of books as for television damaging social interaction who is less culturally aware the slackjawed boy watching television or the slackjawed boy reading one uninspired relic of genre fiction after another i read a lot of books as a kid and watched a lot of tv and each medium provided something different neither one displaced the other since reading and watching arent the same experience  there is an egalitarian obsession that people are all capable of being informed and intelligent we now send everyone to college despite the fact that for many people college is not a viable or useful route the same elitism that values degrees values being wellread and since this is the elitism of the current power structure it is idealized by the less fortunate subcultures bradbury became informed not because he read but by what he read he could have read a schlocky pop novel every day for life and still been as dull as the vidscreen zombies he condemns  he has mistaken the medium for the message and his is a doubly mixed message coming from a man who had his own tv show a book a flamethrower and a very troubled mind  in a dystopian future firemen dont put out fires they start it books and freethinkers are burned with a flamethrower without a seconds thought guy montag one of these incendiary firemen after a series of events starts awakening from his long and blind indoctrination to his horror he finds an identity and a mind of his own but in a completely monitored and subjugated society thinking can cost your life one single mistake and guy may find himself on the other side of the flamethrower  a very short novel with a lot of feel of orwells  a novel that emphasizes the value of written legacy books and free will an interesting read with lots of moments and quotations to remember but somewhat far from the dazzling  experience  what i couldnt grasp was bradburys confusing way to describe things not because of the vocabulary but because of the phrasing several of them seemed incomprehensible or incoherent maybe i just got one of those weird faulty electronic copies or maybe this was just a book that i may have been able to enjoy much more reading it in spanish maybe might try martian chronicles someday in spanish   both movies fell kinda flat interesting but not really enjoyable and specially not    definitely the most faithful to the book some important changes to the original plot but welcomed ones unremarkable acting at best decent effects considering not necessarily a good film but it does have some redeeming qualities   it would be generous if said it has any redeeming qualities terribly unfaithful to the book besides the names setting and some basic plot everything else was changed and not in a good way really nice effects though so i have decided that this is the summer i read all the books i should have read by nowall the classics i have not gotten around to this was oddly sparked by an asshole customer who said to alyssa this is why small bookstores are betterno one in big bookstores knows anything about books which is of course inaccurate and ridiculouspoor alyssa is a nineteenyearold girl who has not read any philip roth and wasnt able to recommend a title to the fiftyyearold man but shes probably read more books than most people you will pass on the street today unless you live on bookland ave and i too love small bookstores but that is not the point another thing that is not the point is that there are other people in the store besides the nineteenyearold girl who is really not the target audience for philip roth and between tom and greg alone every philip rothbook has been read by our staff anyway so i just started thinking about all the books i havent read that are canonical not philip rothive read four and thats plenty but say fahrenheit  solong review short i read this yesterday and its pretty much what i expected even if you havent read it you know what it is about i think it makes some important points but it wont be making my alltimefavorite list still im glad i read it his afterword is very goodi think i may have liked it more than the novel itself so originally published in  and although not that badly aged the book about the world where firemen burn books seems to have lost some of its lustre and allure over the years bradburys world building is phenomenal for this being written in the early s but the third act just doesnt work for me  out of  it probably took ray bradbury some courage to write fahrenheit  in the middle of the mccarthy era his novel is a book lovers nightmare inspired by all the bookburning episodes of ancient and recent history the destruction of the library of alexandria the christian autodaf the nazi and soviet acts of destruction of all cultural legacy that they deemed subversive  in short fahrenheit  is about barbaric censorship established in the name of an absolutist and nihilistic ideology whereby any form of high culture is banned and all sorts of mindnumbing pharmaceuticals and entertainment are promoted indeed the rise of anxiolytic medications antidepressants and mass television was a significant trend when bradbury was writing this book and in a way they still are using value inversions just as  had done before firefighters are the ones who light up the pyres of destruction  the story is that of a fireman who turns to the other side and decides to save the books his escape is perhaps the most striking part of bradburys novel in the end he joins a community of dissidents where each person knows at least one book by heart and actually is that book there has hardly been a better metaphor for the fact that we are the books we read this is one of those books that i love the idea of it a lot more than the read itself  i read this in high school and understood nothing i barely knew a few words in english and honestly would not recommend it if youre just starting out since even now its not an easy read  the dystopian world depicted is frighteningly too close to where were going with a remarkably prescient depiction of melancholic days spent glaring at screens the substitution of thought by the babble of media and a culture of chasing pleasure and titillation this classic shouldve made an intelligent thoughtprovoking read and to an extent it was  initially an odd stimulating medley of the cerebral a shallow existence the ensuing ennui pervasive censorship and the groovy robotic banktellers wireless earphones toasters sprouting hands and whatnot  an interesting idea to start with but stretched too far to make a point about censoring literature and suppressing thought the themes explored are as relevant as they would have been in the s but the entire effect seemed awkward and contrived and even somewhat didactic  there is no character i gave two hoots about least of all clarisse who put me off the book even before i could glean a morsel of enjoyment from the writing im truly grateful that she was done away with in the first few pages i was tired of rolling my eyes at her overstated joie de vivre and needless curiosity what kept me invested was the prose which came alive when mr bradbury chose to focus on nature  passages about dandelions stars fresh hay in the farms rivers and forests  beautifully recounted and passionately rendered  kinda meh fahrenheit  is an example of why i worry when i pick up a classic it was short at least and a quick read didnt enjoy it much so i might lower my rating to  stars rtc maybe fahrenheit  is more statement than story  indeed if im not mistaken it was originally just a short story that later was fleshed out into this slim almost novella of a novel to this readers eyes it never progressed beyond its short story status no i never could love this its too bare the story the world the characters all are but limbless trees stripped of their bark stark and still but for the occasional gust all of these set pieces are in place awaiting the arrival of the main character youll know him by his remaining scrap of bark  the power of the story itself is undeniable especially touching to the hearts of bookworms but once youve heard it pop it fizzles away quite quickly very similar to how if you accidentally overhear that  you see that theres not much else in the movie to get excited about thats the case with fahrenheit  a damn good short story thats gone and got above itself lengthwise i loved the idea of this book was new and interesting for me and how the people thinking of books in bad and wrong ways but really the books changing the people to good ways to something better im glad we have books in this world why does it seem like a sacrilege to rate a classic less than  stars for me an honest review is important and this was not a great read the story was slow and predictable it was stretched into a novel from his short story the fireman and it seemed stretched the characters were stereotypes and not appealing faber was the one character i liked and his message resonated and saved the book from being a waste of time  no avid reader can disagree with bradbury about the importance of books the good writers touch life often the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies through faber bradbury tells us books are important because they give quality of information i would add insight about humanity and life he also believes we need leisure time to digest what we read and discuss with others the ideas presented go goodreads we can carry out actions based on this quality information and interaction of ideas  certainly burning books is not a new occurrence it has been done to demoralize populations and control thinking throughout time but i think bradburys message goes beyond losing books it is about losing ourselves  our heart and soul do we care about others at home and in foreign lands do we take time to appreciate nature and inspirational music in  when this book was published tv was a new phenomenon with its mindless sitcoms and canned laughter i believe bradbury was concerned were people talking without speaking hearing without listening as paul simon says in the sound of silence susan cain entitled her book about the power of introverts quiet in a world that cant stop talking another example i think of bradburys concern would he more concerned in  when we hear a leader tell us not to believe anything we read or see but only what he tells us bradburys warnings seem truly frightening reading this in my s i look back and think how in gods name was i or any of my classmates expected to understand this when we were all assigned it in middle school which for any nonamericans out there is the school for kids ages  roughly one thing that struck me about this book this book was written in  and yet there was a reference to this very year in the book it sort of scared me given the manner in which  was referenced  weve started and won two atomic wars since  i worry with putins invasion into ukraine that we are certainly closer to nuclear conflict than say six months ago  this is the first time i read this book some of the science fictions gizmos that bradbury invented in the book did not seem so science fictiony to me earbudsbig screen tvs  i thought it was a very clever premise for a book and am glad it resonates with so many people hmmmm i felt so indifferent and mixed when i finished reading that i am not entirely certain about my rating for this book so ill put it right down the middle  stars  i do appreciate the premise and thematic allegories to the proliferation of mass multimedia and its promise of instant gratification our modern society teeters on the verge of mindlessness every day i see loads of people glued to their smartphones just scrolling and tapping and scrolling and tapping  half the time with no purpose at all and theres cable netflix amazon tv which are all available on demand who has time for books when there is so much stimulation to be had from this veritable cornucopia of sounds colour and visuals who has time to spend hours using ones own imagination to immerse oneself into another world when there are virtual reality apps and goggles to slot in your smartphones  part of the story also reminded me of the impactful story of anna akhmatova and how she memorised her entire poem requiem during the totalitarian regime under stalin if you do not know about this real life story id strongly suggest that you check it out  bbc culture online has a good article on this  however i am not fond of the writing style employed by bradbury  metaphorical coupled with streams of consciousness  which hampered any potential enjoyment of the content itself the characterisation also left me feeling detached in spite of montag being the sole pointofview character required reading perhaps as modern classic dystopian settings are ever inching closer to becoming reality fahrenheit  is also thankfully short enough to be read and appreciated even if the prose is not entirely to ones liking theres a reason why the guy who is currently touring europe to display new heights of idiocy loves the poorly educated if you deprive people of knowledge and information its much easier to tell them that lets say tax cuts for the rich having no health insurance turning the education system into a commercial enterprise and becoming a complete joke to all of your allies is somehow good for them in bradburys novel the item that stands for knowledge are books and in the dystopian society depicted they are forbidden and burnt by firemen which produces an apathetic society with a massive drug problem  and heres the catch this policy exists because the people in this society are in favor of it knowledge and books enable us to fathom how complicated life is as in most cases issues are no longer black and white but nuanced and ambiguous when you learn more about them thats very tiring and sometimes we might turn out to be wrong which is of course not nice at all and then there are all those feelings displayed in literature some of them very upsetting like anger and sadness in bradburys society people dont want that they want to live in blissful ignorance numbed by shallow entertainment and other drugs and as it also takes some effort to understand and empathize with people who are different from yourself why not make all people the same in the sense of uniform and deprived of individuality  i feel like this book is widely discussed from the angle of censorship and governmental control but i found the aspect of human complacency most interesting bradburys protagonist guy montag becomes a dissident because he feels like a hamster in a wheel and knows deep inside that there can be more to the human experience he wants to be sad and to be wrong and to connect with others in a meaningful way although that might include pain ultimately this is also a book about personal responsibility  this is certainly not the most subtle book ever written and almost a little yaish with a pretty obvious pedagogical impetus but that doesnt mean that bradbury doesnt have some points on top of that his attitude toward technology is rather crude and does not sufficiently acknowledge its positive potential as well as the fact that books are also a mass medium and can be just as stupid as any tv show  plothole but then again this book was published in  now after all this you may wonder why i only gave the book a  in terms of bradburys stance on books and his presentation of what value books should have to humanity id definitely give it a  however in terms of the execution of his dystopian conceit it isnt quite as powerful as i wanted it to be this may be because i just finished reading nineteen eightyfour and compared to the elaborate lengths to which orwell goes to describe every facet of oceanias society the dystopia here felt rather thin i wanted more background and more history than captain beatty presents to guy montag but perhaps thats the way it should be in a world where thinking isnt valued and knowledge is condensed it shouldnt be surprising that the characters know very little about their own history  dont ask for guarantees and dont look to be saved in any one thing person machine or library do your own bit of saving and if you drown at least die knowing you were heading for shore  before i start this review lets be clear that i cant spell fahrenheit to save my life every freaking time i have to see it to type it out grrr tis a difficult word  this bizarre little book speaks intensely without using words to do it about how sad lifes state can get when people become so cut off via slow censorship when i was reading this book it felt like my mind was mentally all over the place almost in some strange psychotic trance heady stuff it must be the authors style that did it a talented man who can really alter perception with his writing this alone helps illustrate the importance of this books theme  reading this made me think heavily about what could happen slowly to civilization as all books disappeared we would be stuck to news and social media through the tv and internet only without books in there of course popular opinions would be limited to media that was slowly corrupted and not published to shock or alter society opinion no differing views all over the place stating reasoning of their decisions in clear concise checklist ways no more poetry for young lovers to read to one another when dining wining and romanticizing their lives and hearts before life shatters it no more empathy learned developed and nurtured by reading about the points of views of others through their eyes and living their shoes this way  the world bradbury weaved is psychologically twisted and strange  a nice place to study but you wouldnt want to even visit there the grimness and blah seeps off the pages and it seems everyone wants to die after awhile where life is through the motions the saddest thing is most dont even know that they think theyre happy of sorts but theyre so braindead its inevitable most of their soul had faded off before their body did  the ending waswell very odd too i dont want to provide spoilers and i knew there was a war looming but didnt expect that the big machine thing was just disturbing particularly a certain persons death theres no telling whatever ended up happening to the survivors we can only assume the memory of the books being held and retold when occasion warranted in the mens minds pleased me  instead of ink being typed into pages and preserved it seems that once read the words soaked into their brains somewhere to come out when needed again  why then only  stars despite the creative genius story behind the book the talent of the maker the book just kept losing me its bizarreness was loosely held together and following it was a bit of a chore as the hero was so imbalanced and wishy washy in thought  the best thing about the book was the end bradbury provided a few pages about the book and then ranted on censorship folks he seemed incredible his words were heartfelt not held back and just awesome they inspire heat and ignite because of the authors words at the end more than this surreal book makes me want to read more from him and only hope there is an autobiography somewhere out there he penned  i started reading this one a week after the authors death in tribute and also it was on my tbr list for awhile as a classic i meant to get to rip ray bradbury may your memory forever remain reading this book was like eating vegtables half the time it was slow torture the other half i licked it up now as a general rule i like vegtables and i suppose i liked this book in my own way but it was hard to get through cant say i regreted when it was done many times i felt like i was bashing my head against a wall but my brain ate up the thoughtprovoking elements i do not believe that technology is inherently bad i dont always believe in the future that this book and other similar dystopian books and movies portray but i am always fascinated by them i found this story compelling and i was hooked from the first page to the last the story was tense and gripping and i found it hard to put down thats the good part the bad part is how onedimensional the characters are i was initially drawn in by guy montag mostly because his name sounds cool and for some reason my head cast him as jon bernthal who i find very attractive and so i think that had me convinced that the character was great but on reflection the character was severely lacking besides his name theres nothing particularly memorable about him hes a rather dull and lifeless hero clarissa was my absolute least favourite trope  the manic pixie dream girl she lacked any real personality of her own and her only purpose in the story was to inspire guy the other characters werent any better either they all fit into some sort of flat stereotype  overall the concept was good and parts of it were interesting and intriguing but it couldve been better executed with more fleshed out characters there must be something in books things we cant imagine to make a woman stay in a burning house there must be something there  hell yeah theres smut  and a lot of it dare i say and im not letting it be burnt by some ugly dude named guy beatty or some other shit like that  this book was okay im really happy to have finally read this though i just have difficulty believing in a dystopian world where people would start burning books like i get people losing interest in books but banning them and burning them seems so extra  there were some really great moments in this book but a lot of it was really boring and the dialogue was so clunky and awkward at times  i like some of the ideas in this book about people needing instant satisfaction and the problem with the advancement in technology and how this book discusses censorship but im not super impressed with the story overall  i feel like i rarely ever like classics  this completes the booktubeathon challenge for reading and watching a book to movie adaptation lol the movie was such shit  stars  stars probably  maybe a little bit higher than that shrugs i dont know i just know that i didnt particularly care for it even though i can appreciate it from a literary perspective haha  i almost always have two books in my currently reading one audio and one physicalebook ive been trying to mix it up a little bit lately as a kind of palate cleanser from all the scififantasy ive been reading this book was a quick five hour listen the narration by tim robbins was outstanding and its a classic and its been sitting in my audible library for over a year haha so i felt obligated to read it i love classics some of my most favorite books of all time are classics although i find i enjoy european classics much more the count of monte cristo is good example of one of my favorites   and ive read enough of them to know that many socalled classics are really not what theyre cracked up to be this was one of those for me was it a good book yeah it was good i think and the message it was trying to sent was definitely a powerful i guess and the concept behind this book was great at the same time though in spite of the great concept and message i didnt feel like it was especially well executed im finished it feeling almost completely indifferent and thats one of my most hated ways of completing a book id rather love it or hate it but this book didnt give me that option so now i dont even know what to feel i think the only reason this book is a classic is because it was one of the first dystopian books to come out at the time but ive read bunches of dystopian novels and i feel like other books have done a way better job of getting their point across than this one did  the writing at times was beautiful in terms of the prose itself but the characterization was extremely weak which left you not feeling any connection to the characters and even the main character was hopelessly bland the narrative was also severely tedious at times events rushed by so quickly that i almost missed a vital point other moments slogged by so slowly that i couldnt even keep proper track of what was going on it just didnt have any life  you know  thats really all i have to say if youve read it and enjoyed it thats great if youve never read it and dont feel a particularly inclination towards it i wouldnt feel any pressure to read it haha it was just okay and im sure you could probably find a better book within this genre a story decades ahead of its time with relevant dialogue in todays world the late ray bradbury was incredibly prescient gifted and hardworking genius  of  stars this is a classic science fiction imagining of a future when the forces of antiintellectualism have completely taken control of laws and regulations former college professors are now wandering hobos with nothing to do other than memorize past written literature and look forward to a time in the future when they may be able to restore it to the printed page that appears to be an unlikely goal because the current political situation as described in the book calls for all books to be burned  indeed our main character is a fireman at the beginning of the book whose job is to burn any books that can be found in other words the roll of the fireman has completely been turned around  three thoughts occurred to me while going through the book  first i thought the idea of burning all the books to be an unlikely dystopian plot but then i remembered that many books that have been banned heres a link to a wikipedia article that contains a list of books that have been banned by governments  second it seemed strange that they were burning all books since that would make advances in technology and science almost impossible but then i remembered that some recent occurrences in the political world have been attributed to antiintellectualism which includes denying facts based on science have you heard of climate change deniers some believe the brexit vote was a reactionary and xenophobic response to modern economics some think the same is true for the popularity of trump those could all be called current signs of antiintellectualism  third i noticed that the assumed roles of husbands and wives as described in the book provide clue as to when the book was written the book was published in  when most husbands had jobs outside the home and their wives did not that was the situation for the main character in this book and it stuck me as being rather strange if the book had been written in the past twenty years im pretty sure that the wife in the story would have had her own job  surveys generally show that about  in  adults in the usa have not read a book in the past year so theoretically if all books were burned a quarter of the population wont miss them as long as that portion of the population remains less than  percent in a democracy books should be reasonably safe  the following is from pageaday book lovers calendar for december   arguably bradburys greatest work fahrenheit  is the story of guy montag a fireman in a dystopian future where books are outlawed and mindless mass media is everywhere guys job is to burn booksand the houses of people who harbor booksto prevent the spread of intellectual thought when the normally obedient guy begins to question the values of his society he faces a very difficult decisionsubmit or revolt its a story that will make you very grateful for your own book collection it may surprise some that this is my first time reading this as its widely regarded as a classic now but its one i hadnt yet got to and never studied in school  this story is very reminiscent of other dystopian works such as  and we and i found the concepts to be pretty familiar when i started i already had an inkling that books would be bad in a world where firemen burned down your home if you owned any but this dystopian world isnt one id want to go to  we follow guy montag who is a fireman and has been all his life hes always burned and never questioned until clarisse his new neighbour whos a  yr old girl introduces him to the idea of whether hes actually happy  montags selfdiscovery from this point in is the main focus and he finds out about what books contain and the oppression his world offers he seeks out others with similar ideas and passions but its not a tale without destruction  overall its a little predictable in the form because its a formulaic dystopian but its still relevant in the concept and the message that books mean everything and help keep knowledge and fantasy alive i think we can all agree books should not be burned and that our love of them will never go away  id like to say watch the truffaut film instead but then i get the smell of kerosene in my nostrils i feel like such an idiot giving the book  stars but honestly i didnt get i understand what the author was saying but i was confused genuinely confused the whole time it all went over my head in this book  it was exhausting reading the book i couldnt reconcile with the writing style i really felt like i never read something in english before it was choppy i was like not getting what the characters were going on about the majority of the times and sometimes it was too much for me i just get into it the way i expected  the idea is something amazing as a reader you cant help but be drawn to it and yet the execution was lacking for me the way the author revealed his dystopian world via long conversation between characters and infodumping didnt sit well with me and i find it hard to believe that we could ever get to this stage too so it was a little unbelievable for me also i wouldnt guess that the world is on the verge of war have they not mentioned i mean theres nothing about the atmosphere of the book that could clue in  the only thing i loved about the book is the main characters journey through the book i felt myself feeling for him and watching him change through the book was fascinating  i wanted to love the book so much but alas it didnt happen it was such struggle from start to finish but im in the minority here
Green Eggs and Ham,i bought some green eggs from a grocery store based on he assumption they would be rated as highly as this book unfortunately it turned out to be mold on the eggs and i contracted salmonella and died would not read again i absolutely hate green eggs and ham not the dish  eggs and ham and green food coloring go surprisingly well together actually  but dr seuss has always been a childhood nemesis of mine and i guess at this point ill just never see philosophically eye to eye with the beloved childrens author for me the purpose of a childrens book should be to encourage independent thinking and my favorites have always been the ones with some shades of gray open to interpretation without a correct answer whereas its obvious from this travesty dr seuss is of the mind that a childrens book should reinforce existing dogma and orthodoxy because how else do you explain this obnoxious thing sam i am and his annoying insistence that the dish tastes good  dont get me wrong getting kids to try new foods because they might like it is a laudable goal but so is having opinions and respecting the opinions of others seuss clearly doesnt get it because sam i am has zero respect for the opinions of others and recalcitrantly demands this poor kid try his dish by the fifth or sixth verse of sam i ams ever more vile antics i was so turned off i desperately wanted to save this poor kid from the torture sure he ends up liking it after he finally tries it but in this respect green eggs and ham is far weaker than marc browns dw the picky eater where also picky eater dw at least is given a choice and it becomes her choice to try a new dish whereas this poor kid has the green eggs and ham foist upon him maybe its because im not a parent but if the kid doesnt want to try it why nag and force so confident that your opinions have to be the correct ones  basically so the kid wont eat the food so what get out of here seuss leave him alone sam i am and if he misses out on some great food its his loss stop overparenting im sorry but ive always found it irritating i remember reading that story to a little girl i used to babysit and it got so much on my nerves in all honesty dr seuss books are all annoying for me but this one was just intolerable i used to like this book okay but now it is just bad the creature keeps on asking the dog if it wants the eggs but wont take no for an answer but then the dog eats the eggs and the likes them  this book annoyed me there i said it kennedy good morning beautiful woman and then i do not like the message that this gives if u keep insisting they will eventually say yes that is a terrible message and should not be read to children terrible i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them samiam the simplistic metaphor of the green eggs symbolizing russia taking over ukrainethe ham was as one would say absolutely distasteful not only did the green eggs make the metaphor unrealistic as there is no such thing as green eggs but it made the ham aspect become underplayed throughout the story no i do not like green eggs and ham how tf do u cheat on ur wife w cancer and come up w this shit    i never liked this book as a kid the drawings gave me nightmares i am appalled  no more than that  i am terrified i am disgusted this is a terrible example for kids  kids should not be forced to eat anything it might have an allergenand so thus therefore if the child has an allergy said allergen will cause allergic  please dont feed your kids this nonsensical garbage  i am so tired of politics and leftist ideas ok so all of the dr seuss lovers out there are going to hate me but i am not a fan of most of his books i really do not like the repetition i think it makes for a very boring story there are a few dr seuss books that i do like stay tuned  i read this story with a class of  and  year olds with a set activity afterwards the children did not engage with the story and personally i found it unimaginative the activity as a result did not go well and the other practitioners i worked with had similar feelings about the story the first book i remember not liking i wasnt able to read yet it was read to me but i didnt like the pushy narrator i made my mom give the book away feel like i owe it to my five year old self  who hated this book to rank it one star i loved every other dr suess book but for some odd reason i could not stand this one i didnt like it as a kid i still dont like it now never understood the love for it it wasnt that interesting and didnt teach me anything what was the point i came across this little book by chance and thought hey i have never read anything from the famous dr seuss shall i give it a try  this book might help children learn words and rhymes but i found the story really really really stupid perhaps if i would have known what the books about i wouldnt be so shocked by how much i disliked it and how little sense it made it was just wow i would never read this book with a kid by choice  and i couldnt help but wonder if kids who have read this book choose more food in bright colours now i know why green chocolate was made on this planet oops im really sorry but i did not like this book at all i gave up and didnt read it all perhaps if i had i might have at least enjoyed the overall messagelesson of the story but my feeling upon starting to read this tale was rhyming silliness sorry its just my personal tasteopinion hundreds of other people really likelove this tale so give it a go  i started to read this tale months ago because id just finished writing my first childrens picture book and i was researching agents and their clients read this with a cousin cant believe people love dr seuss hes not even a real doctor the story was dumb and boring he tried so hard to rhyme everything just made this super cringy also this book is teaching kids bad grammar eating stale food and ignore car safety if your food turned green you should never eat it even some weird hairy monster force you to it could lead to food poisoning and kill you dont goof around on a car and wear seat belts i never enjoyed this book growing up this book is about samiams attempt to convince the narrator to try green eggs and ham he tries to get the narrator to try different places and dining partners to try the food in the end the narrator ends up eating the green eggs and ham and ends up loving the food after being picky and reluctant this book was always so popular and i never understood what was so special about it i liked it as much as i liked the little prince but im very interested in dr seuss since the time i listened to his biography in a podcast way back in  very inspiring wish i had read him when i was little  in my defence prith i had no intention of reading it i stumbled upon republican representative kevin mccarthy reciting it on twitter  i wont allow myself to read anymore childrens book for the rest of the year tho  dont say you dont like it till you try or get to know it seems to be the moral of the story as the opinion changes from not liking green eggs and a ham to liking them after trying  i still found it to be a really odd book the content is really short so i cant call it a waste of time read it if youre interested but i cant reccomend it why adults had us read this as children baffles me  dr seuss makes me uncomfy  green eggs and ham sounds like the worst food in the world  it just teaches about peer pressure like replace the green eggs and ham with black tar heroin still a good story say no to peer pressure from weird adults kids im sorry i just had to rate it one star because it was so annoying and adults had us read this book i also dont like the message or moral that it giveskeep insisting people to try something until they say yes  this book is about samiam convincing the narrator to eat the green eggs and ham the narrator keeps on saying no until at the end the narrator tries the green eggs and ham and then says he likes it  this is the worst out of the other dr seuss books encouraging children to eat rotting food is both irresponsible and in many states it is a major health code violation i wouldnt be surprised if the people who work at chipotle read this book when they were children my kids like to read green eggs and ham it a good book for my kids  you need to more book about kids let me no ok if you cane do more book my kids did not eat eggs and ham tell they read this book green eggs and ham i have to go no i her from you soon
"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter, #3)",separating itself from its forebears its a story of greater complexity darker tones and a vastly expanded mythology i have so much more love for this one rereading it as an adult this home prison aka voluntarily quarantine making cookies and throwing them into trash days i never say im a good cook and each day im getting worse giving me nostalgic vibes its like living never ending mercury retrograde you dont want to start a new thing you have to go back to your past or you have to deal with your unfinished businesses its a rainy sunday its colder than it should be this time of the year so im drinking a delicious cup of coffee and im browsing my goodreads shelves only to realise that i havent written a harry potter review not a single one so i decided to start with the first harry potter book i ever read the one that took me to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and made me believe that magic is something tangible i solemnly swear that i am up to no good  i was  years old and i had just started my english classes in order to pass my proficiency examinations my teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it so she gave me the third instalment of harry potter little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english before i tell you about my experience i need to make a confession it was my choice to stay away from jk rowlings books until that moment i wanted to swim against the current and i thought that harry potter was too mainstream for my taste and the foolish little me was proud of this decision but when my teacher gave me this old used copy something inside me cracked i knew the basics about the story about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly evil dude who doesnt have a nose but page by page i came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesnt want to offers more than that he opened a portal to a world where i longed to be fervently i stayed up late at night with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences and i cheered for gryffindors quidditch team i flied with firebolt and i kept wondering what my patronus would be according to pottermore its a brown mastiff which is oddly fitting i casted spells but never avada kedavra you shouldnt play with this shit and tasted butterbeer in hogsmeade and just like that my life had changed irrevocably i was a potterhead and i was proud of that my mum wasnt though especially when i asked for a wand happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light  there is a reason why jk rowling is the fairy godmother to millions of children and adults worldwide friendship love hope theyre present in her books even in the most desperate times when evil seems undefeatable when no escape is visible she encourages and empowers shows that everything is possible that strength and courage can be found within when you have someone to hold your hand harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving it took him years but he finally found a place to belong to feel safe and cared ron with his witty lines and his constant presence hermione my personal favorite with her intelligence and compassion they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart and even now years later im still under their spell i think i will always be dont let the muggles get you down  im still waiting for my hogwarts letter and secretly hope that dobby is the one to blame i still caress with affection the spines of my harry potter books meanwhile i bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half and laugh at harry potter jokes and i know and its imprinted in my soul that ill never be a muggle again happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light  as it seems my harry potter reviews dont always start with a dumbledore quote but always end up being my thoughts about this book reviews as well for a series like hp thats been read by so many people this might be the best solution though and because the books get longer and longer and because i dont share my friend jaysons amazing and remarkable ability to describe a book in one significant sentence im afraid youll have to bear with quite a lot of my thoughts lol   its one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if theres something wrong with the bitch therell be something wrong with the pup  aunt marge is such a horrible person if you ask me shes really lucky that harry is such a precious cinnamon roll and only made her a big bubble gum lol the audacity to talk about his dead parents like that no wonder harry got so angry aunt marge can float to hell   ive already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us did he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so weve finally got a defence against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies  lupin is the best dada teacher they ever had and i love him so much  his character is just great and i wish we would have seen even more of him unfortunately we werent blessed with all too many lupin scenes    how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirers the resemblance between you is uncanny  and speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst snape is such a horrible teacher i cant even i said it once and ill say it again hes cruel hes a bully he takes delight in instilling fear in his students and he verbally and emotionally abuses them his personal vendetta against harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy movie snape is way nicer than the one in the books and im sorry but if you ask me snapecantberedeemed   theyve got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behaviour hes that tall goodlooking one isnt he said angelina  its the third book and cedric diggory and cho chang are already mentioned also did anyone notice that they are both introduced as seekers as well  so we have all the main players for book  harry draco cho and cedric xd on a side note considering the giggling girls robert pattinson truly is a good cast lol   you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you dont want to be told  ron never ceases to amaze me hes such a shy guy but boy does he become a lion when he defends the people he cares about    dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they cant see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you  the dementors kiss reminded me of one of my rp characters that died through one ahh the good old roleplay times lol anyway moving on i was always intrigued by the idea of dementors and even after so many years their existence and mystery still didnt lose its appeal they are really fascinating creatures and even though i never want to meet one i still cant help but take an interest in them  certainly one of the best things about this book   mr moony presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other peoples business  the first mention of the marauders map the prisoner of azkaban is certainly one of those main books that build the foundation for everything thats yet to come and its already way darker than its predecessors bless fred and george for handing harry the map heaven knows hell have good use for it in the years to come p   theyre dead he told himself sternly theyre dead and listening to echoes of them wont bring them back  it always kills me to read about how harry struggles with the knowledge  or rather the lack of knowledge  about his parents my heart bleeds for him whenever they are mentioned i mean jeez hed endure a dementor just to hear their voices tt   shes got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her   is it just me or is this actually a reoccurring theme since book one there always seem to be sections in which they dont talk to each other because something gets in their way and if my memory serves me right things are going to continue in this vein xd   she had slapped malfoy around the face with all the strength she could muster malfoy staggered  once again i want to point out that im a pacifist the way hermione dished out that slap was pretty spectacular though lol guess she took mr weasley as an example haha sound advice for parents you better dont slap mean people in front of your kids p also is it just me or did anyone else notice the irony of the situation a person like hermione a person that values words resorted to actions because she realized words wont get her far with a malfoy lol   thirtyzero take that you dirty cheating jordan if you cant commentate in an unbiased way im telling it like it is professor  jordans quidditch commentary is legit one of the best things about the series well and the matches themselves of course xd plus mcgonagall swearing like a trooper because the slytherin team was playing so foul is one of the best things ever haha especially because she obviously tried to keep everything objective and neutral at first im flabbergasted again this one deviates from what it had been for the first two books  by a mile just when i thought the second one was more detailed compared to the first prisoner of azkaban is much more complex having a lengthier plot more descriptive characters and environs but still not lacking in any way it makes the first two feel like short stories im going to stop saying this is the best until im done with the series for right now it feels like itll keep getting better till the series end so it goes without saying its the best so far  the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business  though the first two books were quite wonderful the buildup for events seemed much better in this third book the occurring of events seemed much less transparent and manages to keep the reader well in suspense right till the end the plot feels to be moving more inline with the core of series  towards a bit darker side  as the first two had already laid a strong foundation and the world of magic keeps expanding with a lot of interesting elements being added to it i hope im not getting ahead of myself when i say this is becoming one of my favorite book series of all time  i know how to use a fellytone now sirius blacks escape from azkaban prison is on every wizards lips not even the dreaded guards of the prison the dementors managed to keep in a cage the wicked wizard who probably want to meet again his master voldemort but to do that firstly he must kill harry potter the only one capable to stand up to voldemort meanwhile the new school year is about to start at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and harry ron and hermione will become acquainted with two new professors  compared to the previous the third volume of the series is the one that is richer in twists and turns im reading the saga of harry potter to my daughter when in the evening she goes to bed and in this harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban a little tragedy happened when we got to the kiss of the dementor chapter just hearing the title my daughter  years old was so upset by what it might happen that she required that i read that chapter alone and just then telling her what was going on by omitting the scary details apart from this hiccup the reading was neat and clean it is evident that the playful and carefree tones of the first two adventures give way to dark colors after all harry is growing up and its way of seeing things is supposed to change as well rowling takes us in the maturation process of the most famous little wizard of the world using the same plot device of the previous volumes the teachings of headmaster dumbledore the clashes with malfoy the bickering with hermione the conflicts with professor snape i do not know if in the near future i will continue to read to my daughter the harry potter saga or if i will wait she grows enough to read it alone to avoid upsetting her again never mind i will go on because now it is not possible for me to stop reading with the pleasant awareness that there is no healthier addiction of this one get high yourself too still five stars love this so much cant review couldnt even take notes watched the movie immediately after finishing need next book wish i lived in this world damn you rowling  harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is a fantasy novel written by british author j k rowling and the third in the harry potter series harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was released in the uk on  july  and in the us on  september   the book follows harry potter a young wizard in his third year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry along with friends ronald weasley and hermione granger harry investigates sirius black an escaped prisoner from azkaban who they believe is one of lord voldemorts old allies time the things we could accomplish if we had extra time on our hands just this week i mentioned to people that i have been running on fumes with all the things i had to get done if only i had a few extra hours in my week to take a nap or rest with a book thankfully we have a leap year providing our busy lives with a full extra day to get those things done that may have been pushed to the back burner whether its catching up on sleep reading or chores a leap year creates the impression that there is indeed an extra day to accomplish those things that may have been pushed to the wayside despite this adults rarely have the time to go back and savor favorite books but in  a group of us in retro chapter chicks have decided to take the time to reread harry potter in all its glory i find it appropriate that on a day where we can enjoy extra time that i curled up with my favorite book in the series one that indeed tests the limit of place and time  a mass murderer has escaped from prison the news is so important that it even made the muggle news even muggles who detest magic like the dursleys are on high alert for harry potter a wizard about to enter his third year at hogwarts it is just another summer vacation although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school at the dursleys he is treated like less than human his living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals even though aunt petunia is harrys blood relative she also treats him like vermin things couldnt get any worse until uncle vernons sister marge arrives for a weeklong visit and she believes that harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family what marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that harry did not exist harrys true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic his hogwarts family each summer life at dursleys grows unbearable and marges treatment of harry puts things over the top in a fit of teenage emotions harry causes marge to blow up and then he leaves the dursleys home for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time  normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school but with a murderer named sirius black on the loose the minister of magic himself has bent the rules in harrys favor minister cornelius fudge believes that black is a dark wizard and servant of lord voldemort and in his eyes the safest place for harry is at hogwarts under the watchful eyes of albus dumbledore harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the dursleys and will indeed get to return to hogwarts to continue his magical education with the addition of black to the storyline the stories only get darker readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them fudge is convinced that black is after harry and has stationed dementors outside of hogwarts much to dumbledores chagrin as long as dumbledore is headmaster dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with voldemort black was able to outsmart them and all of england is on high alert it is against this backdrop and protection that harry returns to hogwarts  third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms they are allowed to visit the village of hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form the dursleys did not yet they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes harry ron and hermoine enroll in divination and care of magical creatures taught by none other than hagrid hermoine also begins the study of ancient runes arithmancy and muggle studies harry and ron do not understand how anyone even one as smart as hermoine could take that many classes some are at the same time as others which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once the dialogue between ron and hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize meanwhile class work has gotten harder professor snape loathes harry more than ever and the new defense of the dark arts professor lupin is an old friend of harrys father hagrid while the nicest person around and harrys protector is threatened by the malfoys yet again this time after draco is scratched by a hippogriff named buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class buckbeak is threatened with execution adding to the animosity between harry and draco and only hermoine on top of her grueling class schedule finds the time to assist hagrid in his defense all these storylines would make for an exciting tale but inserting lupin and black and harrys antidementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series  the story progresses and animals play a key role in plot development rons rat hermoines cat and a large black dog the three are infinitely linked to one another rowling reveals that black was the potters secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to voldemort he was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named peter pettigrew he is also harrys godfather this information has harrys growing teenaged emotions on high he is more determined than ever to defeat voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness although teenaged pranks occur in this book my favorite scenes are between harry and lupin and black being able to interact with one of his parents closest friends one really feels for harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the dursleys as rowling will reveal much much later dumbledore has his reasons for placing harry there but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return even if the presence of these muggles is key to the plot line  time of course plays a key role in the plot as well hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book he is innocent yet the only people who believe him are harry ron hermoine and professor dumbledore lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf and it is pettigrew who is the servant of lord voldemort this dumbledore explains to harry is magic at its deepest most impenetrable moments and in my opinion the essence of the entire series as dumbledore points out time and again it is ones choices that determine ones fate not their abilities for a few glorious moments harry believes that he can live with sirius and escape the dursleys once and for all it is the most touching moment and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion yet this moment is indeed fleeting the ministry of magic still believes that sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on buckbeak the innocent hippogriff readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because harry and sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time it makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading pretending that i do not know what comes next however knowing that sirius and lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book a crossroads between the end of harrys adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon  time jk rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks the climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest this years leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that i needed after a busy week even in this busy life that i lead i have found the time to visit harry potters magical world yet again as the plot moves deeper into harrys teenaged years and he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind it is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all i dont know what to say other than i love this book i loved learning more about harrys parents i loved harry ron hermione fred george and everyone else i loved the storyline and how every single seemingly pointless detail somehow ended up meaning something to the bigger story and how i was left completely in shock i loved the introduction of divination and i loved sirius i love love love this series superb storytelling i am in love okay i will admit it here publicly for the very first time ive got a mad crush on remus lupin  how could i not have fallen hard for a man who by day has the vibe of a young pablo neruda and by night strips down naked and takes on werewolf form  i mean can you imagine having sex with this man  well i have several times and as a woman who read the entire harry potter series as an adult rather than a child i could not get over my joy when the series shifted from the wonderful but somewhat saccharine childlike storytelling in books  and  and took on a more mature feel  please dont get me wrong i love the first two books in this series but i love them for their magical quality their appeal to children and their overall introduction to this world  but the prisoner of azkaban at least for me marks the shift into adolescence and the less tidy endings  and of course the introduction of sirius black and remus lupin to the plot  i loved rereading this third book the past two weeks with my middle child and i can not get over this new set of the illustrated series by jim kay i mean   im not sure i can imagine a reading experience more sublime can you  my two absolute highlights from this novel are  when remus lupin turns to hermione granger and says youre the cleverest witch of your age ive ever met hermione its a shift from everyone poking fun of hermione for being a teachers pet or a nerd and acknowledging her as a force to be reckoned with  and jim kays illustration of harry summoning his first real patronus   my god i turned the page and goosebumps ran down the entire length of my body then i cried like a child my daughter who was sitting next to me wasnt exactly surprised shes been around for the last two years of this horror called perimenopause but she was like mom pull it together  i couldnt help it damn it i think id run back into a burning building to grab this book  remus this is my favourite book in the harry potter series  it marks a distinct change in tone and a maturation of the writing as the characters grew older the challenges they faced became more dark and intense the plot became murkier especially in regard to sirius and his involvement or lack thereof in the murders of potters parents it all just got so much better i think this is a large part of rowlings success she could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow and her readers rejoice  this is also the first time the real threat to harry is realised sure weve seen voldemort on the back of professor quirrels head and we saw an early tom riddle in the form of horcorux diary type thing but the dementors were an entirely different level of danger the entire story felt less comic and less feelgood for the first time it seemed like harry potter could actually die if he didnt find his courage and repel them with his power he owed much to lupin here a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses but a hugely pivotal one in the development of harry  and for me thats why this one is the best because eit is the one where harry truly found his confidence literally one of the best books ive ever read i was chained to it for two days i cried and laughed and yelled shit when all of the action went down  im such a peasant for judging this series before i had read it i read the first two and half of this one when i was about  before reading was cool before i had the attention span that reading requires i know these are kids books but i was a particularly distracted child i did not know mother rowling forgive my sin and all the times when i said i dont think harry potter is really my thing please  this book was incredible and this series is a classic more than any dickens or middle earth or narnia shit has any right to be this series isnt up its own ass its so accessible and readable and meaningful  god damn me how could i have been so blind  forgive me because this book changed the game this book deserves  stars and im getting the cover art from my edition tattooed on my thigh  im such a fucking fan and the series turns young adult   and the series is getting better and better lets get the story more twisted shall we  harry potter you lucky you i would be the happiest muggle alive if i recieve the same birthday gifts bookworms you know what i mean  and i clapped so hard when the second chapter ended way to go potter  he didnt have any muggle money either i can totally relate but i am an adult muggle unlike you potter  the firebolt period  a book fighting scene treat yourself  just hermione things  are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored them  chapter   that mirror is more creepy than being helpful  okay the moment you reach towards the end of this chapter you know youre not going to put down the book yes dont try this at midnight   chapter   this line i dont go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me  i can feel you hp       i have the whole notes on each chapter but lets keep it there as for time being  in short my heart leaped  damn its not landing soon   hahaha you blackman you got me there be on the look out for stepheny potthead aka the book pusher aka quick draw stepheny aka the nutty professor last seen running along side the knight bus with harry potters invisible cloak also suspected in the kidnapping of fellow goodreader jeff and bestselling author stephen king blonde hairbig green doll eyes has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesnt get her way loudly considered armed and dangerous approach with cautionand nerds she likes nerds  now back to our regularly scheduled review  i dont listen to a lot of audiobooks i prefer to read but i was kind of falling behind in my reading commitmentsand i had put ms stepheny off again and again for this buddyread soooooo many times i couldnt do it again to her she poutsand she gets all mopey and it is just heartbreaking i am so happy i listened to this one stephen fry was just perfect perfectand harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was just the thing to put me in the christmas spirit this book is superior simply because it has sirius black in it sir please take my heart i do not care this is definitely my favorite one in the series so far the improvement of rowlings writing style compared to the first two books which were absolutely amazing as well is very evident  there is a lot more build up and suspense in the tense and exciting scenes the parts that included foreshadowing were carefully placed and not too obvious  i have a deep love for the new characters and the old ones were as lovely as always they are just all so well developed and interesting and lovable as well as a perfect mixture of strengths and flaws i also like with harry potter and the philosophers stone and harry potter and the chamber of secrets was surprised at the amount of humor thats included i often found myself chuckling and even laughing out loud i just had so much fun while reading  during the end where all the conclusions are laid out rowling was being very thorough i dont think that any questions are left open everything was well thought through so that every single little detail adds up and makes sense thats definitely something i wish i would read more often in other books my experience i started reading harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban on  and finished it on  definitely a fantastic read second time around i love the knight bus and stans accent even though its not so easy to read the dursley are hideous and well written i enjoy the boggart chapter a lot and the marauders map is awesome i compare the read to the movie a lot in this book and i must say the actors acted very well to how the book is written especially snape and malfoys sneers i absolutely love fred and george the twins and their speech are always makes me smile  this book is told in the third person point of view following harry potter as he gets ready for his third year back at hogwarts his summer at home with his aunt petunias family is as horrible as ever there is a new teacher for defense against the dark arts this year harry learns about the notorious jail breaker sirius black this book also introduces the soul sucking dementors who are guards for the azkaban prison the dementors comes to hogwarts to protect harry and hope to catch sirius black the concern is that sirius black is hunting for harry potter but what surprises harry most was when he learns who sirius black truly was  a well written book harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is a goto pick me up kind of read i first read this series in  i remember loving it i have seen all the movies i started rereading the series last year  this year  i continue on rereading the series i think i love it more now than reading it during my first time because i have the movies to help me imagine how the story goes the actors both heroes and villains played their parts in the movies very well i love the magic  houses quidditch game class lessons actions and adventures with harry and friends and the writing i love the illustration at each chapter headings the writing just pull me in and i could never put it down i love this series and i highly recommend everyone to read it soon  pro actions  adventures friendships mystery suspense humor magical world couldnt put down fast paced page turner easy to read illustrations  con none  harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban or how jk rowling decided that harrys life was way too easy  narrated by james text by james jokes by james or not  it is said that one year said harry potter woke up with an unpleasing relative on his head and being the angsty preteen that he was he blew her up of course actions hav
Wuthering Heights,i am just on fire with so much admiration for emily bront right now having read this book i finally understand why its generated such fierce controversy since its first publication in  why early reviews dismissed it as an aberration with one pearlclutching reviewer wondering how a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters and why writers like sylvia plath and em forster drawn to the complex often contradictory open vein of the novel went out of their way to reject such easy classifications  this review is in many ways my attempt to understand and interpret how wuthering heights continues to enable many difficult and contradictory stances even today entrenching its legacy as one of the most dynamic and generative novels of the th century  the first element that makes wuthering heights so interesting is form the novel is presented as a series of secondeven thirdhand accounts a story rehearsed and sanitized by multiple reenactors with the reader being the last in a succession of interpreters in other words the story changes hands multiple times often between hostile and uncomprehending narrators before it makes its way to the reader this structure is nuanced in multiple ways it is also very tricky it depends first of all on the readers willingness to turn to nellythe central narratorto provide an authoritative interpretation of the story but nelly is not a very sympathetic narrator and her thinly veiled bias against or for the characters brings into question the validity of her account throughout the novel we are forced into awareness again and again of the flawed nature of these interpretations and of the uncrossable distances that lie between what we are reading and what the story is  the novels acts of withholdingof depriving its readers of seeing all the way to the center of its main characters and into what may be kept in those interior roomsengineer a profound decentering of view that not only challenges us to take nothing at face value but also demands our active participation in the process of meaningmaking faced with the possibility that the novel might be the culmination of a failed interpretation one can only read wuthering heights with a kind of longing with the desire to get close to something inconsolable just beyond reach therein lies i believe the potential for true understanding in the underground currents of emotion the places far beneath the surface of what the reader can see and understand in other words it is this frame of reference however flawed and imperfect that gives the characters a context in which we can begin to accept understand and grapple for their ultimate depths  this brings us to the second element which makes wuthering heights such productive fodder for interpretation the characters in a story that is told at one two sometimes three removes bronts characters are not at all remote instead the author brings a depth of anguish to the characters and engages our compassion no matter how unflattering and biased the gaze through which we see them she makes you feel deeply both her characters humanity and horror at themselves makes you understand that they are not merely heroes or villains but flawed people who hurt and were hurt  this is nowhere as gorgeously epitomized as in the characters of heathcliff and catherine with whom lays the broken heart of wuthering heights  heathcliffs vehemence his grief and naked want catherines selfishness her strain and struggle against the confines of her lifeare rendered so honestly and so rawly in a way that appealed to me despite sometimes because of their deep abiding wrongness this is not just a story about a toxic romantic attachment between two deeply broken and detestable characters in fact to argue the degree to which heathcliff and catherines relationship was toxic or problematic seems less relevant to me than the incontrovertible fact that in a world a life that would not let them be whole catherine and heathcliff lent meaning to each other to me this is where the simple truth of wuthering heights lies in catherine and heathcliffs longing to be recognized by each other in a way that defies and transcends separation and in the subsequent void and loss they suffer when one is intolerably deprived of the other  indeed the novel returns over and over to a theme of identity through the other the desire to be defined in terms of an existence beyond our contained selves for catherine and heathcliff their very sense of self was sustained through the bond of devotion they forged between them in childhood back when they were flashing with youth and magic and hunger and their passion for each other has always illuminated the gap between who they longed to be and who they actually were invoking heathcliff catherine confesses to nelly at one point that hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same in this way wuthering heights is so truthful about what it means to be human to desire to be known by another as intimately as completely as one knows their own image in a mirror to love and despise and long for and tire of each other because it is a much merciful fate than a lifetime of emptiness silence and absence  under this light it is easy to understand heathcliffs and catherines unraveling and in understanding to love and pity them we understand that in losing heathcliff catherine lost her life and in losing her heathcliff lost himself all the proofs of passion all the crawling devotions that sustained him in youth have yielded to nothingness and somewhere inside heathcliff a dam has broken with nothing in its stead to stave off the madness of being alone or to ward off the unpurged ghosts of a brutal past  through heathcliffs unraveling bront lays a carefully layered generational look at the reverberating effects of trauma and what it costs to give others so much power over us raised with the stigma of illegitimacy and of deviancy and potentially of race but thats an essay for another day and subjected to a childhood of casual abuse namecalling and cruelty heathcliff spends the years following catherines death trying to methodically reproduce his traumatic past his experiences of degradation and loss in others heathcliff ultimately does not just preserve the memory of catherine which he feels bound to but rather transform it into something else into a display of his wound in full  it is impossible not to feel at once entranced and horrified and rocked by the horror of what heathcliff becomes but however much i ached with sympathy for a younger heathcliff i found myself hurting more for cathy hareton and linton and the complex manygenerationed hatreds that twisted between them through heathcliffs deliberate and calculating attempts to recreate past circumstances in the second generation the novel paints one of the clearest portraits of generational trauma that ive ever read the fact that wuthering heights was conceived and published before the advent of psychology is proof that bront was truly ahead of her time even more impressive is the way bront gets that point across through utilizing intimate domestic spaces as prison and disfiguring family as a site for violence evil and struggle the result is a novel that understands so thoroughly so completely and with bonedeep care that the scars inflicted by childhood abuse by trauma by the generational inheritance of atrocious memory do not just fade away they stay and linger and fester until we all become a casualty of each other  in short wuthering heights is a profoundly haunting experience of a book one that i am sure will hover doggedly around my thoughts for a very very long time this is my favourite book i do not say that lightly  ive read quite a lot from all different genres  but this is my favourite book of all time ever the ladies over at the readventurer kindly allowed me to get my feelings of utter adoration for wuthering heights off my chest in their year of the classics feature but i now realise its time i posted a little something in this blank review space i mean come on its my favourite book so it deserves better than empty nothingness  so what do i love so much about wuthering heights everything okay maybe not that wouldnt really be saying it strongly enough  what i love about this novel is the setting the wilderness this is not a story about niceties and upper class propriety this is the tale of people who arent so socially acceptable who live away from the strict rules of civilization  its almost as if theyre not quite from the world we know the isolation of the setting out on the yorkshire moors between the fictional dwellings of the heights and thrushcross grange emphasises how far removed these characters are from social norms how unconventional they are and how lonely they are  this is a novel for readers who can appreciate unlikeable characters readers who dont have to like someone to achieve a certain level of understanding of them and their circumstances people are not born evil so what makes them that way what torments a man so much that he refuses to believe he has any worth what kind of person digs up the grave of their loved one so they can see them once again heathcliff was not created to be liked or to earn your forgiveness emily bront simply tells his story from the abusive and unloved childhood he endured to his obsession with the only person alive who showed him any real kindness to his adulthood as an angry violent man who beats his wife and imprisons the younger cathy in order to make her marry his son  it would be so easy to hate heathcliff and i dont feel that he is some dark sexy hero like others often do but i appreciate what emily bront attempts to teach us about the cycle of violence and aggression heathcliff eventually becomes little more than the man he hates by being brought up with beatings and anger he in turn unleashes it on everyone else and cathy is no delicate flower either what hope did heathcliff have when the only person he ever loved was so selfish and vindictive but i love emily bront for creating such imperfect screwedup characters  this is a dark novel that deals with some very complicated people but i think in the end we are offered the possibility of peace and happiness through cathy younger and haretons relationship and the suggestion that cathy older and heathcliff were reunited in the afterlife i had an english teacher in high school that said cathy and heathcliffs personalities and their relationship were too much for this world and that peace was only possible for them in the next i have no idea if this was something ms bronte intended but the romantic in me likes to imagine that its true i understand why many people hate this book catherine and heathcliff are monstrous monstrous you wont like them because they are unlikable they are irrational selfabsorbed malicious and pretty much any negative quality you can think a person is capable of possessing without imploding they seek and destroy and act with no thought to consequence and i find it fascinating that emily bronte chose them to be her central protagonists  when this was first published it was met with animosity because of how utterly repugnant these two characters were the way they go about their business caring nothing for others but themselves was enough for me to shake my head in complete and total judgment as if catherine and heathcliff could see me and are then effectively shamed by their actions  wuthering heights is epic in my humble opinion because i believe that the scope of this story is monumental let me explain it is a simple tale between two families that are bound in such a way that their fates are irrevocably linked what affects one affects the other its about catherine and heathcliff who fall in love and how their relationship ruins the lives of those around them the book all  pages of it occur almost entirely at wuthering heights the estate of the earnshaws and at thrushcross grange the estate of the lintons with only a couple of miles of land in between  and yet it is not a small story  the emotional magnitude of this book is great and far reaching the provoking and unapologetic quality of brontes writing is seductive the process of reading this story can feel so masochistic sometimes that its almost if shes daring us to stop reading and throw the book away like its a game of personal endurance to see how much we can take how far we can go she pushes at us challenging us and all the while knowing that we have to keep reading because redemption awaits it is nothing like its contemporaries  the moors the darkness of the moors that curses the household of wuthering heights and its inhabitants is ever present nature is personified it is its own character its there lingering and simmering ever so quietly saturating every scene with its silent threats of doomokay i have to stop talking like thiswhat am i anymore  there is poison in this book but let me ease your mind by saying that it is balanced with goodness also this isnt a perfect novel there were still moments i found myself in perplexion recently invented word and while everything about catherine and heathcliff may be corrupt there is hope in wuthering heights if you can journey through the menacing forest of emily brontes imagination do it because the view is something to behold all i care about in this goddamn life are me my drums and you  if you dont know that quote youre probably too young to be reading this and isnt it past your bedtime or shouldnt you be in school or something  but that quote hyperearnest cheese  that is romance wuthering heights is something more dangerous than romance its one long protracted retaliation masquerading as passion and goddamn do i love it i cant believe i havent reviewed it before  i mention this book in more than half of my reviews i have a whole shelf devoted to its retellings so why the delay but better late than never  no its not a perfect novel its a flawed structure revealing the actions of seriously flawed people the framing devicewithinaframingdevice totally awkward having nelly dean tell the story even though where was she for most of the action totally wrong move bronte it makes the beginning such a slog to get through but thats just stale loaf  the good stuff is all the meat in between  and oh the meat the swarthy stranger of mysterious origins being raised in a family of sheltered overmoist english mushrooms all pale and rainbloated the running wild twosoulsagainsttheworld adolescencechildhood indiscretions vows and tantrums bonding unspoken promises yes i will yes i will yes i will oh but wait whats thisits blond and its rich and its whats expected of me very well then see ya heathcliff  its just textbook gothic from here on out revengeseduction overheard conversations mysterious disappearances murdered puppies swooning vindictive childrearing death ghosts moors phoar  but this to me is a perfect love story even though its more like torture the unattainable is always more romantic than the storybook i dont like an uncomplicated ending and a story is more impactful with nuanced characters preferably heavily unlikeable throughout this is where i plug headon  one of my favorite movies ever do itthis story just makes me feel good and im well over my teenage fascination with the bad boy i realized pretty quick that bad boys are usually pretty dumb so i moved on to emotionally disturbed which is the same thing really plenty of drama and they will leave you drunken presents on your lawn road signs carousel ponies but not complete burnouts at least but my teenaged dating pool is neither here nor there the point is that heathcliff can be romanticized as this victimvillain without having to correspond to the ideal its about the level of passion the size of the grand romantic gesture devoting your life to destroying the people who kept you from your true love is an amazingly grand gesture  tormenting and passionate stars for a reading experience like no other because never have i read a book that altered my emotions so many times in one book my feelings moved in waves between compassion and despair admiration and loathing pity but always regret victims or tormentors  thats for you to decide  for me wuthering heights is an epic and timeless classic that has everything obsession greed revenge grief emotional abuse inequality and even light horror everything except the thing most associated with this story in my opinion this is not a love story  it is the most beautiful love story that never happened and in that lies the tragedy and the power of this book  it is a sobering waste of life and love as the cruelty and selfishness of the characters shape their own story against the rigidity of an intolerant class system that pretty much predestined their fate anyway yet the unbreakable bond that existed between the two main characters sees them pursue each other  but always when it was too late with the haunting realisation that this selfdestruction is set to continue into the next generation as the sins of the parents threaten to live on through the children with the same cruelty and brutality they heaped on each other  a brutal yet passionate story a story about love desire and obsession but with ugly consequences made all the more intense for its victorian england setting  in fact victorian realism at its best raw rigid unforgiving and profoundly devastating  the plot  heathcliff becomes part of the family as thrushcross grange when mr earnshaw takes the orphaned boy home to be part of the family accepted by cathy but bullied by hindley heathcliffs early start in life is sad and pitiful contrast that to the man who becomes obsessed with cathy and whose life is turned upside down when the teenage cathy ultimately chooses wealth over love and marries linton  overhearing a conversation where cathy admits that heathcliff will never be a man of means he flees the grange and only returning when he has acquired a fortune what he didnt hear from the last part of the conversation was cathy professing her unwavering love for heathcliff with the iconic words i am heathcliff and later i cannot live without my life i cannot love without my soul flawed decisions and a selfdestructive nature dam the lives and outcomes of these soulmates  however in an act of revenge heathcliff marries cathys sisterinlaw isabella and fathers the son who is then to meet cathys daughter in the second half of the book hope or hopelessness  review and comments  not all stories have to be cheerful with happy endings  after all thats life but it is how we respond to those that defines us this brings me straight to the characterisation in the book which is absolutely superb whether you like or loathe these characters there is no doubt they were brilliantly cast in fact as a character study not one of the characters can elicit a single ounce of admiration from its readers with the exception of the young cathy and hareton yet they all make tremendous book characters  the writing style is perfect for the storyline and even the dull palette colours depicting the moors and weather reflects the mood of the book and sense of forlorn and hopelessness as does wuthering heights itself a place naked to the elements with surroundings that are untamed and raw that mirror the characters central to the story  a love story  although romantism has a powerful influence on the story this is not a love story instead it is a powerful story of love and unity of two souls in life and in death the iconic words will resonate with many i am heathcliff as cathy explains  because hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same those words get me in the feelers every time powerful and heartbreaking  from the outset and throughout i was invested in this story the writing and particularly with the characters as you feel this connected sense of cruelty selfdestruction and mourning for the countless memories and happiness for the life and love that could have been  but never was yet as a reader we are left with guarded optimism for the future of the young cathy and heathcliff or are they too caught in this perpetual cycle of selfdestruction like their parents  the writing in these classics is not for everyone and i confess to struggling with it at school if you can embrace this writing style then you will love it in fact i just finished a mainstream thriller and i turned to my husband and said now i really do need a fix from the classics if i had one niggle i dont like authors writing in local dialect that is too cryptic for example aut neink meaning ought not think for me personally it disrupts the flow of the story spoils the beautiful writing in these classics but brings little to it back to the book  a painful drama and an unapologetic portrayal of the flawed and imperfect human mind and heart dark chilling and so vividly depicted beautifully written but not a beautiful story a book where love grief and betrayal fuel cruelty and revenge  heartbreaking savage and selfdestructive nevertheless a masterpiece particularly in its characterisation and the character development i first read this in ap english literature  senior year of high school this book is dense and thick and confusing and with a class full of haters it was hard to wrap my head around it i subsequently read it three or four more times for classes in college and every time i read it i loved it more i always found some new fascinating piece of the story i had never picked up on  the last time i read it i suddenly realized that there were many hints and clues that heathcliff could in fact be black a quick shot at research into liverpool where mr earnshaw found the urchin shows that it was the home to a thriving slave trade this theory completely changes the story in my opinion  or the thought someone brought up in our seminar on the brontes  what if nellie is in love with heathcliff and subsequently altered how she told the story you do find nellie to be coincidently involved in many key scenes throughout the text what if she isnt the good guy most readers assume she is  wuthering heights is one of the quintessential novels in history theres nothing else you can really say about it except that its one of the best pieces of writing to ever be created its just that incredible cathy and heathcliff a love story at the beginning of our narrative mrlockwood a tenant of thrushcross grange visits his landlord mrheathcliff at wuthering heights four long miles away across the cold eerie moors people back then walked a great distance they had few options without much complaining troubled lockwood wants to get away from society he came to the right place the setting is northern england  in the yorkshire moors a vast remote desolate and gloomy grassland beautiful and ugly at the same time a haunting locale lockwood is the only person who likes heathcliff  a capital fellow in the area he sees something no one else does on his mournful face sadness maybe even regret  like himself  later he learns the story of his landlords tragic life through mrsnelly dean his servant at thrushcross grange for three generations  she tells him about the life of heathcliff found in the streets of liverpool hungry  crying dirty all alone without anyone caring there at the tender age of two but the compassionate mrearnshaw a wealthy man  catherines cathys father and takes him home they never discovered the boys true identity but because of the childs dark complexion everyone calls him a gypsy the two catherine and heathcliff grow up as brother and sister at wuthering heights always together cathy and the unwanted orphan playing on the lonely moors they are soulmates  resented by cathys older brother hindley who beats him many times in fact everyone does still the gentle mrearnshaw loves the boy morose showing no emotions he cant afford to still very angry underneath because of how others treat him as an inferior heathcliff was never given another name when teenager cathy decides to marry edgar linton from a respected well off family and heathcliff hears about it  he disappears to parts unknown the penniless man feels betrayedyears pass and heathcliff comes back from america rich nobody learns how and he doesnt say either probably not quite honestly and seeks vengeance the children of each estate the lintons of thrushcross grange and the earnshaws of wuthering heights inherit their respective homes cathy wants to maintain a friendship and maybe more with heathcliff the weak edgar of course hates the gypsy yet cant stop the two from seeing each other the attraction is too powerful the triangle will soon dissolve people come and go but the moors abide strong novel with a bittersweet plot love or despise this classic you cannot help but admire its quality heres my choice for flashback saturday at the time of another mercury retrograde one of my all time favorite classics wuthering heights  the readers of this unconventional provocative masterpiece truly diverted in two sides haters and true admirers  im one of the admirers because i always like to read about honest approach to the monsters wearing human furs in the real world catherine and heathcliff are irritating extremely selfish destructive illogical characters they can be definite as threatening monsters the claustrophobic dark agitating world building at yorkshire moors desolated remote freezing grassland reflects true beauty and ugliness at the same time  like the reflection of its own habitants combines with the dark souls of the characters and push you into depressiveintense bleak world of them filled with grudge hatred resentment  why a man turn into a monster abuse he endured throughout the years from his family can manipulate his mind and make him think hes not worthy enough his bottled up anger growing inferiority complex sadness pushed him so far to kill the last pieces of humanity left in his body he turns into a violent man beating his wife cursing to his faith becoming more vindictive at each second fueling himself with the pain of the others just like he suffered when he witnessed his soulmate chose to marry with someone else and deep inside he is still humiliated gypsy orphan boy even though now he is rich and powerful man  but in the meantime the man is still capable to feel passionate love did his obsessive love feed his hatred and push him too far to plan his vindictive revenge  hes not the only villain of the story his true love catherine is also selfish vicious filed with hatred the anger inside of them darkens their souls they slowly decay and turn into ruthless creatures who dont carry any piece of empathy catherine and heathcliffs story was too intimidating destructive unconventional for th century of england but as far as i can see its still way too much complex heartfelt painful for the world were living in too  multi poved storytelling technique and the heartbreaking moving extremely disturbing dark traumatic and truly tragic story of two most argumentative characters of the literature still haunt my soul but like a moth to a flame i cannot help myself to be drawn to this book over and over again  here are my favorite quotes do i want to live    would you like to live with your soul in the grave  be with me alwaystake any formdrive me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you  im tired of being enclosed here im wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it  hes more myself than i am whatever our souls are made of his and mine are the same  you loved methen what right had you to leave me  im now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself  i have to remind myself to breathealmost to remind my heart to beat there are two wolves and they are always fighting one is darkness and despair the other light and hope which one wins the one you feed  cherokee legend  i have to start by saying holy cats that was not what i was expecting  this fabulous tale begins with bumbling mr lockwood who wishes to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and looks forward to the beautiful country life hes on a mission to rent thrushcross grange from its owner who also owns wuthering heights manor hes welcomed as much as anyone would welcome the plague and is met with harsh treatment as well as pack of illtempered dogs who violently maul him add to that a snowstorm that puts him in his sickbed this rural getaway is beginning to seem like a capital idea  as mr lockwood convalesces at thrushcross grange he becomes acquainted with the keeper of the house ellen dean treading lightly after his previous encounters with these inhospitable people he approaches miss dean with caution and inquires after the intriguing inhabitants of wuthering heights ellen  or nelly as shes known is of a kinder disposition she rushes off to get her knitting and settles in to tell the tale of all of the broken souls who haunt the halls of these oncegrand

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland / Through the Looking-Glass,if anyone ever tells you that you cant write a book keep in mind lewis carroll  lewis carroll the author of alices adventure in wonderland is actually a pen name as lisa of troy isnt my real name he already gets bonus points from me his real name was charles lutwidge dodgson wikipedia describes him as somewhat asymmetrical he walked rather stiffly and awkwardly and he was deaf in one ear he had a weak chest from a bout of whopping cough and a stammer  and yet  he wrote alice in wonderland  everything was smooth sailing from there on out right  of course not  in june  the first two thousand copies of alices adventure in wonderland were printed however the illustrator john tenniel was so dissatisfied with the printing of the pictures that carroll decided that all  copies would be sold as wastepaper carroll wrote in his journal about how he probably would not even break even  according to wikipedia there are only  known copies of the wastepaper version in existence and they are incredibly valuable  heres hoping that my mistakes will one day be worth millions  what did i think of the story itself  dodgson made some huge gambles for starters he picked a female protagonist in the s alice is having adventures not talking about boys or love thank you mr dodgson  the author is also highly creative inventing all different kinds of characters from the cheshire cat to the queen of hearts alice also drinks and eats to become smaller and larger this was such a great concept to think about arent there instances where you feel like you have very little power almost voiceless and other instances where you feel like you can make a great big difference where you are a key player  what is an unbirthday present a present given when it isnt your birthday of course  the opening to alices adventure in wonderland is such an intriguing scene alice sees a rabbit dressed up looking at his watch and stating oh dear oh dear i shall be too late for me this is the perfect blend of reality and fantasy i can imagine being in a park and seeing a rabbit hopping out from his or her hiding place it isnt too far of a stretch to imagine it also clothed and talking  in through the lookingglass there is a poem within the book entitled jabberwocky which i read back in nineth grade reading it again it almost cries out to be read aloud it is so much fun  also traces of through the lookingglass can be seen in neil gaimans coraline which i loved  however this type of literary genre is not my favorite philip pullman my favorite author says this of how to write think of some interesting events put them in the right order to make clear the connections between them and recount them as clearly as you can in this particular case i didnt see the connection between scenes alice seems to shift quickly between her interactions and i dont understand how this is one united story because the story is so disjointed i didnt feel like we were making any progress and didnt feel the suspense rising  the other question when you go into an alternate realm is how are we going to get home the answer to that question in this book is entirely underwhelming  based on my research it appears that there is some symbolism underneath the story but i dont fully understand what that is perhaps it is a function of not living in the victorian era or understanding the politics and mores of oxford  now if only i can think of a childrens story that will stand the test of timeif not i guess at least im not asymmetrical  if youve been following me on goodreads you know i have a tradition of reading a classic novel at the beginning of every new year i always want to read more classics and never do so this is one of the few ways i can read more i adore the disney movie alice in wonderland and have owned the book for years but never read it  well this book really was like reading a fever dream not much of it really made sense to me and everything changed so fluidly as if you were in a dream its easy to get sucked into the story and carroll does have a very inventive mind but i think this is one of those books where the legacy it created is better than the original please dont shoot me anyone i love the pictures included and will always be a fan of alice in wonderland but not sure i will read anything else by lewis caroll my husband put it perfectly when he called this david lynch for kids  i talked about my first time reading this book in a booktube video people love this not me does that mean im not people  usually i like scatterbrained nonsensical stuff and thats probably my problem i dont get the references at least some of the wild and crazy antics seem to happen to prove a point about the ridiculousness of some or other quirky british convention so maybe all the wacky shit that goes down in alice in wonderland has a deeply satirical basis i must give carroll his due the satire that i did get i enjoyed however for me much of this fell flat and even occasionally annoyed me just the same i will take this issue upon myself and promise to eradicate my lack of knowledge in the realm of archaic th century british mannerisms haha like hell i will  still and all three stars is not hating a book and i dont hate alice in wonderland there are many delightful characters and scenes im glad i finally read it and am now able to separate the original from disneys bastardized version randomness galore  yet isnt that the reason the disney tale is such a part of my early formative years  obviously the disney film is a combination of both books as alice wakes in the first book from her wacky adventures that all but defies psychoanalysis her sister dreams about her sister dreaming the second volume as alice is brought back to waking life from the lookingglass house she realizes that one of her feline pals has dreamt her adventure this last revelation of being protagonist in someones somethings dream is the point at which pretzel logicality is masterfully displayed  david lynch was undoubtedly inspired by the pseudosymbolic and semimetaphoric tales spun by the mad carroll there is insanity  yet is not the rat worseoff than the pied piper  are we all just mad  ive read the first book a few times but finally decided to read both alice as a character is very easy for me to identify with all the same i would be lying if i said i still feel that this is a masterpiece it can be a headache to read i much prefer the original disney film  it has always been a favourite the tim burton one is lovely as well this is one of the few books ive come to love more as an adaptation i dont get one thing though why is joker one of the most talked about characters from the wonderful creatures he had equal parts just like every other one in the wonderland at least alice in wonderland not talking about through the looking glass here a boat beneath a sunny sky lingering onward dreamily in an evening of july   children three that nestle near eager eye and willing ear pleased a simple tale to hear   long has paled that sunny sky echoes fade and memories die autumn frosts have slain july  still she haunts me phantomwise alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes  children yet the tale to hear eager eye and willing ear lovingly shall nestle near  in a wonderland they lie dreaming as the days go by dreaming as the summers die  ever drifting down the stream  lingering in the golden gleam  life what is it but a dream  a boat beneath a sunny sky lewis carroll immensely likable characters and a masters feel for the eccentricities of language without a doubt unbelievably beautiful and enduring   i recently saw a review where someone had read alices adventures in wonderland felt completely confused and was basically told by all commenters that carroll was on opium as an explanation for the weirdness of the writing i suggest that original poster instead pick up a copy of the annotated alice both alices adventures in wonderland and through the looking glass were essentially written for one person alice liddell most of the references in the books that are completely odd are injokes that can be understood only by a reader living in england at the time of the writing or in some cases by alice herself some parts of the book are mathematical references that probably only carroll understood and still other references are informed by how chess pieces move about a board gardner pulls together vast quantities of information to make the reading of alice more available to modern readers nearly every poem in through the looking glass is a parody of a popular poem of the day and those original poems are included in the notes there is a complete translation of jabberwocky including which words really were made up by carroll and which were actual words youll be surprised   whether or not you have read the alice books i suggest reading the annotations as you read the book this is as opposed to the oz books where i found it easier to read the whole story first and then the annotations i think this is because gardner does not include a note in the annotation as to what he is referring to in the text and you would end up reading the entire book twice  anyway altogether an enjoyable read even if it is not as good as the annotated oz if youre going to read alice in wonderland i recommend this specific version which is a paperback bindup of alice in wonderland and its sequel through the lookingglass its also a relatively slim book at less than  pages combined many of the original black and white illustrations are in this book although as it is a massmarket paperback some of the pictures are a bit smalldark and it can be hard to see details  the quality of the stories themselves meh theres a lot of nonsense and i dont mean the good kind some of the plot twists just come out of nowhere and do not lend support to the books especially with the ridiculous endings could be a matter of personal taste but i dont feel that the alice stories have aged well  nonetheless if youre looking for a light cheap easily portable bindup of the two alice stories with some illustrations and really the stories need illustrations i really recommend this format i thought this was fun loved getting a chance to read this child classic carroll had to be on drugs when he wrote these books digital audiobook performed by christopher plummer   believe or not i had never read this classic of childrens literature before oh i knew the basics of the story and of course i had seen the disney movie when i was a child i even had one or two of the chapters included in a series of books i had as a child and still have to this day but it took a challenge to read a banned book to finally get me to crack this one open  i certainly understand why this story is so beloved by so many legions of children there is absurdity fun word play unusual situations talking animals and a slew of outlandish characters still i think i may just be too old to really appreciate it i was bored with much of the craziness i just couldnt let my imagination run wild and enjoy it  christopher plummer does a fabulous job of narrating the audio version however his gift for many voices and accents added to the experience i absolutely loved the way he voiced the white rabbit also there is a bonus chapter at the end  an alternate ending to the knights tale that carroll wrote but which was never published id rate plummers audio performance  but i wont increase the overall rating charles lutwidge dodgson is far better known by his penname lewis carroll carroll  was a very intelligent person not only was he a writer but he was also a mathematician an anglican deacon logician and photographer lutwidge in latin was rendered ludovicus the anglicised version of which is lewis carroll stems from an irish surname similar to the latin carolus from which comes the anglicised charles put together it would have been carolus ludovicus or as he preferred it lewis carroll i had read alice in wonderland when i was a child i have since seen a few execrable alicebased movies but recently i realized that it had been decades since i had actually sat down and read this book the edition i have had not only alice in wonderland but it also has the sequel through the lookingglass which also contains the poem jabberwocky  alice is a nonsense book it was a story told to the real life alice alice pleasance liddell the young daughter of friend of carrolls considering when it was written it is a staggering feat of imagination from the start when alice goes down the rabbit hole we run into a myriad of famous characters from the chesire cat to the hookah smoking caterpillar i enjoyed the great meeting and funny conversation between alice and the mad hatter and the march hare the multitude of characters is amazing while this is a childrens story there is enough tongueincheek humor to amuse adults but this is also a tale to be read for the sheer scope and originality of the imagination that spawned this wonderful world in the sequel alice goes into the looking glass and has some more nonsense adventures before finally becoming queen what is interesting because i did not recall it was that humpty dumpty was in the story the edition that i have came with original illustrations by lewis carroll himself so why then only  stars simply put it was good but the childrens tale that this is at heart wasnt really for me it has its moments and there are parts that bring a brief smilebut on the whole i am too old too cynical and not of the mindset that this book was geared for though to be fair at the time when it was published queen victoria took an immense shine to lc and this story also to be honest i found alice to be rather annoying shes stumbling and bumbling around this new world and she asks a lot of stupid questions offends a lot of people and generally causes trouble such as when she keeps eating things that make her grow big or small while this is in the nature of this fantastical story it does not make alice herself more likeable at least to me  so after many decades i have reread an old childrens classic i am glad i did since this is a must read for everyone however it is a book that once readi can honestly say i feel no need to read it again anytime soon some of the poems are not bad but on the whole i am no fan of reading pages and pages of poetry the poems are part of the story as it relates to certain characters but for the most part i did not care for them  there are some rather interesting and intelligent gimmicks especially for their time such as when the mouses tale is written in such a way that the words look like a mouses tail or the fact that the jabberwocky poems first stanza can be readif one hold it up to a mirror finally the last poem on the last page if one were to take the first letter of every line then the words going down spellalice pleasance liddell it is because of rather interesting things like that which is why i read this book but i am not a disney person nor do i tend to watch childrens movies so for me this was an interesting read and i am glad i reread it i just think it is a good bookso three stars if one factors in things like time period originality art and poetry then this can easily rate as a  star story albeit always a  star childrens story which is what lewis carroll intended all along initial thoughts  i loved that the story begins right away lewis carroll does not waste any time  i really enjoyed all the weird characters and dialogue really fun and just enough random for me i think its because i already know what happens p  the poems throughout the stories are awesome another fun factor  the cheshire cat and tweedledee and tweedledum are my favourite characters loved the cat for his creepiness and loved the twins for their silliness  what the hell there are some aspects that didnt make any sense but you wont feel alone because alice feels the same way  although there was a sense of randomness the story had a steady flow and wasnt hard to follow  alice really loves her cats  giving both stories  stars overall i am not going to lie i had no idea what was happening most of the time reading this book it was strange and i do not like not knowing what is happening i did prefer alices adventures in wonderland over through the looking glass who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle   lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days   its a great huge game of chess thats being playedall over the worldif this is the world at all you know   of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the lookingglass this was the one that she always remembered most clearly years afterward she could bring the whole scene back again as if it had been yesterdaythe mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knightthe setting sun gleaming through his hair and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled herthe horse quietly moving about with the reins hanging loose on his neck cropping the grass at her feetand the black shadows of the forest behindall this she took in like a picture as watching the strange pair and listening in a halfdream to the melancholy music of the song   life what is it but a dream  well now that we have seen each other said the unicorn if youll believe in me ill believe in you  after liking rather than loving the ebook of alices adventures in wonderland i thought i might try through the lookingglass in hard copy format more accurately the gorgeous penguin clothbound classics edition sent to me by my lovely friend kathi to see if i liked it more in that form to be honest though while i did enjoy the read i think im just too serious a person to fully fall in love with alice  carrolls imagination is still absurdly wonderful but i preferred the characters in the first book eg the cheshire cat i really disliked the lack of plot though and overall through the lookingglass felt like simply an addon to the first book rather than a fullyfledged sequel  recommended for people who want to read more of alices wacky adventures  well this was a fine kettle of fish or at least the second one had a lot of fishy poetry in it my first memory of these is when my dad read them to my sister and i when i was  or  alices adventures in wonderland is definitely my preference for story although one of my favourite poems is the jaberwocky  for those who somehow managed to grow up without ever hearing of these books there is a description on the books page many of the films dont do justice to her young age or the silliness of all of this lewis carroll was brilliant at parodies and of course children who read or heard this when it was written were familiar with all of the originals here is a link to those if youre interested in seeing them soooooo im finally done with alice hmmm to be honest i had some prejudgements on it but i was sadly mistaken well honestly i was looking for a little of rationality in the story but i had to give up after the pool of tears  i dont care what anyone says i liked through the looking glass far more than wonderland as if carroll matured for the second book story was full of brilliant ideas bundled up together i wish carroll had talked about them more but still it was quite alright if i ever decide to read any alice books again id go for the looking glass i got this for free with my audible membership and i was looking for a quick listen and thats exactly what i got it was well read but didnt blow me away and i actually just recently read for the first time in english well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be  it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high the annotated alice is a  book by martin gardner incorporating the text of lewis carrolls two major stories alices adventures in wonderland  and through the lookingglass  as well as the original illustrations by john tenniel it has extensive annotations in the side margins of the original text which explain and elaborate on the contemporary victorian references including the poems carroll parodies mathematical concepts wordplay and traditions such as the parlour game snapdragons featured in carrolls original stories  its also one of the smartest books ive ever read i think i only understood maybe half of itthe mathematics were just too much for me its brilliant  march   note this isnt the edition i read but another goodreads doesnt have so i just picked one with a close page count and that was pretty and called it good   ive never read this classic before and i went into it thinking i would dislike it to actually really like it which is kinda a shock to be honest lol  its utter nonsense with a protagonist who actually has a head on her shoulders and the whole story is just so odd you cant help but like it while also being very very confused at times haha  through the looking glass i did have a harder time liking at first but once alice was on her way i enjoyed it more as opposed to alice in wonderland which i enjoyed from the startso i liked book one better then two  lets get something straight i love whimsy cant get enough whimsy could read whimsy all day long but this sht made my brain hurt on the plus side it does have some genuinely funny moments is of course wildly creative and is great for kids but in my opinion adults should avoid reading this in the precoffee hours of the morning it might make you angry and i dont believe that was the intended effect i do appreciate the book i really do however not as much as i appreciate a good plot or a bad plot for that matter how can you not love the story that inspired so many retellings that takes you into a world full of wonderful madness and adventures for someone that grew up watching the movies before reading the books i find it hard to disconnect the two so when i read or listen to these stories i always find myself comparing them what i really love though is that the disney movies both cartoon and the first live action movies took ideas from both books and gave them a cool interesting twist that incorporated both stories into one mostly coherent story respectively delightful story that was full of so many puns and moments that made me laugh it was very random though like one moment alice was here then the next moment she was in a completely different place so yes i did like it but sometimes i was like ummm ok that was a quick transition enjoyed this more when i read it as a kid and definitely feels like a fever dream with all the wacky characters and conversations an amusing and imaginative world for sure
The Picture of Dorian Gray,one star because i loathed dorian gray and henry whatshisname morallyshadyimmoral characters have never appealed to me and whenever i encounter them they end up ruining the entire experience a notable exception was wuthering heights  sibyl vanes narrative was boring and i do agree that she was shallow and quite idioticthere was an entire chapter dedicated to describing dorians experimentation with jewelry and embroidery which was so completely mindnumbing i skipped it altogether and by the last quarter or so id stopped reading and just skimmed the rest i bet i wouldve enjoyed this more if id simply read the notes on text and saved myself a whole lot of ennui a word henry likes to use and which unbeknownst to him applies splendidly to almost everything he says  in addition i do not understand the authors insistence that the picture of dorian gray or any work of art for that matter ought to be assessed based on its artisticaesthetic value and not on whether it carries a moral message because i love it when the book im reading is trying to convey somethingi actually feel that this book contains a moralistic idea that one should never fully indulge ones whims and passions without considering their consequences and that physical beauty means very little when you are an abhorrent human being on the inside  i would also condemn a work of art if i found it preaches encourages praises or otherwise tries to present in a positive light an action or an idea that i consider to be immoral obviously homosexuality does not belong in this category if that is what wilde was trying to get around  lastly the ending was utterly unsatisfactory id hoped that dorian would be publicly hanged this death was too merciful for his shallow selfish loathsome and ugly self henry the pretentious shit should have gotten something too i was sure ill like this book but it was so boring long and uninteresting the long descriptive pasages were the death of me i read a paragraph and immediately forgot what it was about which was pretty frustrating  not for me cleanliness i did not finish the book the opening scene is of an artist and his friend admiring the artists recent painting of a young man when his friend tells him he should exhibit it at the grosvenor the artist replies that he cannot i have put too much of myself into it this i believe sums up the book perfectly but unlike the artist in the story oscar wilde chose to put forth his art and therefore himself before the publics eye  the public did not like what they saw despite the fact that the editor censored over five hundred words containing the most controversial and explicit sections of the book at its release the novel was proclaimed stupid and vulgar dull and nasty poisonous coarse and crude and a work that delights in dirtiness and confesses its delight  this is a story of a young man dorian gray who is vain hedonistic and virtueless realizing that his beauty and youth will fade dorian decides to sell his soul on the condition that the picture will age and fade and that he will stay beautiful and unaltered once the pact is made he uses this mask to pursue all manners of deplorable debaucheries although he remains unchanged the portrait grows increasingly hideous and records every sin  it would seem that oscar wilde in publishing his book wished to unveil his own mask his own portrait that recorded his secret life perhaps he was tired of carrying the burden of a hidden alternate self or more wanted to finally be recognized and accepted for just who he was  so would say homosexuals for that was the darkness both the story character and the author plunged into along with for the story character at least taking drugs torturing friends and murdering and it was the explicit homosexual portions of the book that were censored both versions of the book however are printed today the censored and uncensored  it is not a personal opinion that this story reflects the authors life  the introduction to the book makes it very clear by siting his inspirations books with a similar vein of homosexuality and the people and himself that he patterned the books characters after to quote the introduction scrutinized by critics who questioned its morality the novel portrays the authors internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that ugliness is the only reality  i understand why the world would wholeheartedly deem this a classic i fail to see why this should be on any christians recommended reading list  i did not finish the book  like my reviews then you should follow me because i have hundreds more just like this one with each review i provide a cleanliness report mentioning any objectionable content i come across so that parents andor conscientious readers like me can determine beforehand whether they want to read a book or not content surprises are super annoying especially when youre  pages in so heres my attempt to help you avoid that let me cut to the chase this is a terrible book written for bad people  sure some people will argue that the picture of dorian gray is a classic etc etc but it doesnt take a genius to sort out that canonization isnt any more indication of a novels quality than its presentday popularity in fact one could argue canonization is just a form of presentday popularity but thats another story  at its core the picture of dorian gray revolves around a fairly trite gothic plot that could sustain a reasonably entertaining tale of say  pages unfortunately wilde decided to continue writing for another odd pages motivated apparently by his need to wedge in a certain number of witty oneliners and convey some big ideas  theres no denying that wildes oneliners are indeed witty the only problem is that they often come at the expense of what little naturalness existed in his incredibly melodramatic overwrought prose so that the direction of a scene or conversation is horribly distorted to accommodate a certain bon mot worse yet in the context of serious writing these quips often fall flat under their supposed intellectual burden rather than existing as they should as pretty essentially empty ornamentation which is one reason why wildes comic plays succeed far better than this atrocity of literature  allegedly the picture of dorian gray is a complex novel of ideas but apparently i was too dense to find those deep thoughts ultimately this book is nothing more than a paean to cynicism and despair conventional morality and society wilde argues is hollow and hypocritical the few good characters in this book basil hallward etc are weak and sentimental at the same time rejecting morality in favor of hedonism leads inescapably to guilt punishment and ruin the fate of dorian gray thus ultimately the only reasonable course of action according to wilde seems to be that of lord henry wotton disdain for the world and detachment from line punctuated by the occasional witticism along the way  in short both as an ideological treatise and a socalled work of art the picture of dorian gray reads most of all as an advertisement for suicide im so disappointed i think i might cry this book was supposed to be great its a classic but for me it was one of the worst books i have ever read i hated it at the end i skimmed over the last  chapters cause i just couldnt bear it any more  oscar wilde explains everything to the minimal detail the beauty of the flowers their perfume the air the sun the birds the trees jeezzz the book was slooooow i used to think dorian gray was this smart handsome man but i found out he was a brainless guy who was easily manipulated he didnt have a thought of his own at all there were so many gaps in the story and then lord henry oh my every single word he said was so stupid it was just boring  i tried classics but they are for people way smarter than me i like bdb psychangeling darkhunter and other series alike and im damn proud of it i might try something else from my classic bookshelf buy it wont be anytime soon this book gave me a headache for once im going to follow one of my mothers favorite admonitions if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all the picture of dorian gray  a retelling by me  dorian gray is beautiful and an artist and a lord becomes infatuated with him  the artist paints a portrait of him and dg becomes infatuated with himself and prays he stays young and beautiful forever and that the painting changes instead  that somehow happens  lord poisons dg with wicked books and thoughts  dg spends  years being a right bastard but looking as young and innocent as ever  dg grows paranoid kills artist  dg gets more paranoid narrowly escapes being justifiably murdered  paranoia  guilt drive him crazy  he stabs painting but painting gets restored to beauty and he dies ugly and with the knife in his own heart  someone please tell me why that needed two hundred pages of over flowery selfindulgent british prose  i get the beauty of language for the sake of beauty i get the overall themes  morals  lessons of the story had i read it in my more poetic high school days i might have even liked this story but i must have gotten more jaded in my old age i want words to be functional in their storytelling not decorative  so i would say really   stars for plot premise but i subtract  stars for wanting to stab my eyeballs out the entire time oh sorry i just woke up i fell asleep because this book is a snooze fest oh sorry i just woke up i fell asleep because this book is a snooze fest wildes classic tale of a man that sells his soul for eternal youth a read that i found rambling in parts hard to engage with other than the main story arc re the picturemaybe a well known classic but did absolutely nothing for me  out of  i gave it onestar for being a well known read and wildes best seller i found this book very problematic and was not expecting the story line at all like this there were so many derogatory references about women marriage about ways to lead a life that at some point i was wondering why is this even termed as a classic both the characters henry wotton and dorian gray were hideous throughout the book while i get that dorian was influenced by henry at a very early age and hence was totally under his wrong supervision he also had friend like basil to guide him but he still preferred henrys advise all through it was like dorian never grew up  physically and mentally in fact he grew from bad to worse the only take i got from this book was that you should not put a lot of importance on beauty and appearance and should invest more in your soul but it was quite a twisted story to reach to this moral i would not recommend this book to anyone for the fact that most of the concepts mentioned in the book are no longer relevant today they might have been prevalent in s when this book was written also it might not be relevant today but we read lots of historical fiction so that we know about past and history this book does not offer much of that too one day one of my high school english teachers and i were having a conversation about books when i started talking about frankenstein  an avalanche of syntactical nonsense came out my mouth i love frankenstein so much and i made it pretty clear to my teacher  she told me if you love frankenstein then you really need to read the picture of dorian gray content in her recommendation she said no more as i quietly yet urgently shelved the book higher up on my toread shelf this was over a year ago so how high it went up is up for debate  i finally got around to it on an airplane from copenhagen airport to jfk with a trusted  pencil in hand i started the book ready to annotate i was intrigued at first the incredibly shallow characters were entertaining especially lord henry his pseudointellectual musings made my head tilt with a chuckle and an eye roll  but beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face   intellect destroys facial harmony its such a load of bologna that you cant help but laugh and i found myself chuckling several times while reading the book especially in the beginning the first few chapters made it clear to me why the book is heralded as a classic  unfortunately the more i read the more i questioned everyones judgment what began as promising literary genius degraded into nothing more than annoyingly shallow drivel i understand that the characters are supposed to be shallow and that the titular protagonist sold his soul to stay young and beautiful but reading these characters made me want to slowly scoop by scoop excavate both my eyes with a wooden teaspoon until i never had to set eyes on oscar wildes writing ever again or maybe i should do that to dorian gray my cousin elizabeth explained to me that i should externalize those emotions not internalize them  you may be thinking you hate the picture of dorian gray partly because the title character was awful yet frankenstein is your favorite book even though victor frankenstein is one of the most atrocious characters in all literature trust me i wondered about this too both characters truly are awful but frankensteins story was simply put more moving whereas i found grays story to be awkwardly paced decently written and admittedly pointless i found frankensteins to be a deeply meaningful beautifully written and poignant account of a selfish egotistical fool feel free to disagree with me  and many have considering this books average rating is significantly higher than frankensteins  but i stand by my opinion  having said all that my biggest problem with the book was the simultaneous eroticization and infantilization of gray hallward the artists attraction to gray is obvious from the getgo the samesex attraction added some interesting spice to the character dynamics but then hallward and lord henry would drop lines that made gray sound like a little schoolboy  just turn your head a little more to the right dorian like a good boy said the painter deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lads face that he had never seen before pg   man is many things but he is not rational i am glad he is not after all  though i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture you had much better let me have it basil this silly boy really doesnt want it and i really do if you let anyone have it but me basil i shall never forgive you cried dorian gray and i dont allow people to call me silly boy  and you know you have been a little silly mr gray and that you dont really object to being reminded that you are extremely young pg   grace was his and the white purity of boyhood and beauty such as greek marbles kept for us pg    maybe i misconstrued the quotations or am reading too deeply into words like good boy silly boy and white purity of boyhood but all these descriptors make gray seem like such an innocent little boy whos being sexualized by these two predatory old men i couldnt shake this feeling throughout the book and grays melodramatic outbursts only further cemented this image in my mind i try not to be one who judges books on their content because doing so can be such a copout but it seems different here  whether its from wildes poor characterization or his sick writing choices i neither know nor care  im just thankful that im finished with the book it took me longer to read than i thought it would but at least i can cross it off the list maybe i wont stab the book like gray did his portrait but i have half a mind to throw it across the room externalize dont internalize i had no expectations going into this i was just reading it for a book club and to say hey i read this in short i wish i hadnt  the men in this book were wretched and cruel they constantly tore down women and called them stupid and foolish along with many other terms the men themselves acted like this in an attempt to hide their horiness new word for dorian gray i literally played ur so gay by katy perry while reading this the only male character i can excuse is dorian gray himself since the whole point of the book is to show how vain and horrible he is well i just suck i tried to be mature and read a classic but i was so bored like so bored wasnt wilde gay why would he create such misogynistic and hateful characters my favorite part of the book was when  wont mention the name for spoiling purposes dies because it was the only part of the book where something interesting happens i guess the upside to the book was that it was really short so i was put out of my misery rather quickly when i just read some chapters of this book i didnt realized anything wrong with it however i talked it over with others and realized that the book was full of allusions to the worst side of life something that might remind you of hyde in dr jekyll and mr hyde  oscar wilde the author was gay so there are even allusions to that this book was considered immoral and the people during that time who read this book were extremely surprised this book was the evidence given in wildes trial for his homosexual liaisons  wilde noted in a letter basil hallward is what i think i am lord henry what the world thinks me dorian what i would like to bein other ages perhaps  dorian in a language i think it was ancient greek but im not sure means brotherly love  i mean the story starts out by describing the scene where basil is at his studio with lord henry as you can obviously guess theyre both male but the author says the studio was filled with the rich odour of rosesthere came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pinkflowering thorn from the cornerlord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honeysweet and honeycloured blossoms and so on do you notice how the author put in as much feminine details as possible  and as the story goes it gets worse and worse the author states a whitesmocked carter offered him some cherries he thanked him and wondered why he refused to accept any money for them do you understand what this means this means that the cherries have been picked in the midnight would you pick cherries in midnight no unless you are a robber  also on the same pagepg a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips and of yellow and red roses defiled in front of him if you dont know the meaning of defiled you might want to look it up in the dictionary  this book is full of poisonous influences even wilde accepts the fact dorian kills his friend basil he rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear crushing the mans head down on the table and stabbing again and again  if you want to read this book im not the one to stop you but i hope to be the one who make you think twice about doing so the themes that this book tries to accomplish is noble but there are better more entertaining examples about the idea of moral corruption the antagonist in this book is vain self absorbed racist and misogynistic he spouts pompous philosophical nonsense that no one else in this book has the cognitive ability to refute so they simply accept it as truth because someone they think is intelligent said it but how smart is a person in a room filled with ignorance the author sends these characters on these self important aristocratic soliloquies for what feels like eons and it is terribly boring this book seems like a dystopia for wealthy high society people who think that the idea of their wealth and vanity as a bad thing and not a sign of their eloquence over lowlevel society is a nightmare maybe it would terrify daisy from the great gatsby but it bored the fuck out of me i dont think ill realistically get to this book the writing just doesnt work for me ive been hearing really good things about this and im a sucker for dark academia but i really cant do anything about writing that doesnt work for me o also because i have other books im more interested to get into coughs finishing the greenbone saga and the poppy war trilogy maybe reread shades of magic because i have no self control coughs the more i read classics the more i realize that when people say they love them its either because theyre afraid of judgement or because they have bad taste  a classic is supposed to be timeless it is supposed to be enjoyed by future generations if a book cant stand the test of time then it isnt a classic and should be forgotten  i really have a hard time understanding women who read shit like this and give it five stars i as a woman have always been forced to look over the blatant misogyny in classics simply because theyre old and thats how things were back then well guess what things arent the same anymore and if a book cant correspond with that it belongs in my trash can  dont tell me i have to tolerate insult after insult being thrown at my gender in every single chapter by a character that is supposed to be witty and morally gray and even by the third person narrator aka the author himself just because its a classic i will not yes all classics have sexism here and there saying things like women are emotional but this book was a whole another level of insolence that rubbed away any openmindedness i forced myself to have for the actual story from start to finish  henry the piece of filth himself has no personality whatsoever and contradicts himself multiple times and decides to insult women at random occasions expressing his spermfilled ideas even when the subject of dispute is not even about gender he is everything i hate in males and i dont think the character was meant to be this way  this issue with the book was enough for me to give it a low rating but i still tried unfortunately this book has no redeeming quality throughout its entirety  the characters are terribly written i dont mind shallow characters unlikable characters are what i like in literature but these characters were beyond ridiculous sibyl vane was basically a copy of juliette and dorian was so damn stupid i could not stand him and thats the ironic part since it is mentioned multiple times in this book that women are unintelligent and yet the biggest imbecile in this story is a male  the plot is badly written i was  into the book and just then things started to pick up then in a hurry the author decided to fastforward to the future which was lackluster to say the least people never notice that dorian is still young in the end and the horrendous things that dorian has done are vague and not explained this book shouldve been under  pages  the ending was painfully predictable and the whole story had zero element of suspense and left me with no emotion or shock in the end  nothing a classic yet nothing to offer what a shame this book is one of the worst books that i have ever read it literally sucks so bad i regret reading it so much every time that i open this book i wanted to gouge my eyes out with an ice cream scooper i dont usually ever write reviews but wow this is terrible the language is so annoying and pretentious like geez we get it you know big words calm down this book is for all the people that think theyre really special and important like seriously go and put your glasses on the tip of your nose is somewhere else but leave me out of this this book has such tiny words and every word is terrible and boring and it is literally no action to it and i hate it the things i would do to not have to read this book or in numerable its literally so bad i cant put it into words if i could write this less than one stari would oscar wilde should stick to writing plays because this is trash why are there no female characters like its just a bunch of dudes talking about how much they hate women who wants to read this if oscar wilde was alive i would give him a strongly worded scolding about putting trash like this out for the masses this book is so bad that instead of reading it im sitting here writing this review thats how bad it is legitimately its so bad please dont read this for your own good im warning you its the most pretentious piece of trash youll ever set your eyes on omg after watching a league of extraordinary gentlemen i thought that dorian gray might have an interesting history and wanted to research it well guess what its not this story could have been great instead there are maybe a dozen pages that are worth reading thats it out of over  aack total waste of time headdesk this book could have gotten its point across in half as many pages sometimes less is more every character annoyed me to no end and since they really liked to hear themselves talk it dragged the book and me against my will on and on most overrated book ever i usually dont review books i dont finish which is why it seems like i dont read a lot i read and give up but i have some thoughts not on the book though haha buckle up because youre going to be surprised how much i write for something i didnt finish  first ill actually talk about the book a bit i think wilde is a talented writer but this book just drags i was pretty excited to read this book thinking it was my first wilde one but then i remembered that i read the importance of being earnest and really enjoyed it which is likely the subconscious reason i was so excited for this one when i first checked this out at my library online i got a  chapter version i realized this before i started reading so i went back and checked out the full version regrets if i had read the shortened version i would have finished it because ive read more pages than are in it  after giving up on the book i read the wikipedia description the ending was predictable and i could guess it from the beginning i think just as with american psycho i stopped right before it got interesting though other plot points i wouldnt have predicted and i was quite upset to read on wikipedia that dorian kills basil who i think is coded as gay  on a side note im pretty tired of booksmovies that explore morality specifically stuff like american psycho and a clockwork orange that do so by indepth description of murder and rape male authors must think its edgy to write that crap or something wildes book is fine because at least up to where i got it doesnt describe violencerape indepth but it still dragged on boring details and plot points were few and far between again when there was plot i was quite intrigued by it  honestly i dont have much thoughts on this book but the reason i wanted to write this review was because of a particular aspect of the book the portrayal of jews lets just say its unkind folks this led me to one of my most common google searches insert name antisemitic now i know what you might be thinking if oscar wilde is antisemitic its just a product of his time to which i reply with my favorite response how can you excuse antisemitism in an era that jews had to live through how can you excuse racism when there were bipoc living in that time etc what if in the future people look back on the present and say about certain sexist racist or homophobic remarks that thats just how it was back then nope its inexcusable in any era  anyway this google search didnt have many results a good sign however i did read this extremely interesting essay on the subject it specifically talks about the jewish character in this book and whether or not his portrayal implies that wilde is antisemitic my conclusion based on this essay is that wilde is not antisemitic win and it was especially intriguing to learn about his jewish friends who stood with him during his trials nonetheless i agree with the essays statement that this does not exonerate wilde of the charge of insensitivity however it is difficult to imagine a jew reading wildes novel without being offended by the passages on isaacs the jewish character  furthermore as if this essay werent enough of a deepdive into is insert name antisemitic it actually lead me to another one  here is the passage from the essay that started it not only does isaacs the jewish character stay in england but he clings on tenaciously to english culture as embodied in its most august representative william shakespeare isaacs never abandons shakespeare and is even proud that he has been ruined five times by the bard isaacss multiple ruin by shakespeare is symbolic for it was shakespeare more than any one else who established the negative image of the jew in english literature in his portrayal of shylock in the merchant of venice  doggydoggywhatnow shakespeare alright folks to google shakespeare antisemitic the first article i read was this this article shows both sides antisemitic vs not which was extremely interesting if you ask me though if your play was a favorite of nazi germany its antisemitic but the article makes a great case that the play is more complex than that and i do believe thats true however lets talk about jim jefferies i swear this is to make a point  he is a comedian and his acts in the past have included sexist jokes including rape jokes despite these horrible jokes i generally like jefferies and find him funny around the time of the harvey weinstein scandal he apologized pretty sincerely for his offensive jokes my act is what you would call an acquired taste but ive always believed that my audience understood that those are jokes and dont represent my actual beliefs then came the day when a large part of america was willing to write off pussygrabbing as locker room talk and i started to rethink that  i was stupid to think that people like harvey weinstein were rare look at your twitter and facebook feeds this week and youll see women sharing their own stories using the hashtag metoo chances are that every woman you know has experienced harassment or worse i thought i was a pretty good guy what with all the not raping ive done but it turns out thats not enough its a start but its not enough   my plea is not to shakespeare but to whoever is still putting on this play think critically what are your audiences leaving with after watching do they understand the nuances that the smithsonian magazine claims or do they just see antisemitic content how would a jew feel watching  at first that smithsonian article intrigued me and i believe i may still watch the play like a movie of it or something at some point but it was more difficult reading this washington post oped the language of the play seems loud and clear  shylock is repeatedly referred to as a kind of devil the devil himself the very devil incarnate the devil in the likeness of a jew and a cruel devil thats when his opponents are being charitable at other times he is a damned execrable dog and an inhuman wretch throughout the play shylock is rarely referred to by name mostly he is simply the jew sometimes colorful but repulsive adjectives are added on dog jew or currish jew  though in the smithsonian article wellknown jewish scholar susannah heschel states i think it is absolute idiocy for people to say of merchant its antijewish and therefore they dont want to study it its a treason to western civilization you might as well go live on the moon if being antiwestern civilization is treason then call me a traitor  my views align more with the washington post oped in the first century and a half of its history the merchant of venice was hardly ever produced and it virtually disappeared from the stage lets give it a break for another  years  at least  i dont believe in banning books or plays or anything like that but i do think we should be selective about what we praise and what we lay aside overall i did not like this book i found oscar wildes history more interesting than this story although i found the idea of eternal youth and moral decay fascinating the pros lacked intrigue here are a few problems i had with the novel too predictable the plot and action in the novel can easily be predicted by the reader nothing actually happens which leaves the reader unsatisfied without climax when it does happen it was predicted it was very frustrating even though the pros may be beautifully written they are complex ion all the wrong areas when something exciting could be describedthe author brushes over it instead wilde describes the greek gods or flowers in the garden the third and final reason although there are certainly more i do not like the way women are portrayed in the novel how negatively we are discribed the men do not even consider romance worthy of the female gender even though homosexuality is apparent in the novel that is not an issue being homosexual is not the issue its hating the other gender where is the tolerance the picture of dorian gray is a classic oscar wilde is in top form but i hated i
"Night  (The Night Trilogy, #1)",night is a book that is given more credit than it deserves simply because it is about the holocaust in my opinion it was a book written by a man with a broken heart who wishes to transfer all of his pain to his readers his book talks about nothing but pain suffering and his lack of forgiveness there are much better books that talk about the holocaust but also talk about the forgiveness and grace that allow survivors to move on i recommend the hiding place as an alternative to this monstrosity i dont think i can provide a star rating to this book too much mixed feelings at the moment this used to be one of my favorite books until i learned mr wiesel admitted to having falsified most of it disappointing revelation book  in non fiction november in the preface the author wrote that only those who experienced auschwitz know what it was this is a very important statement and tlcannot be any more true it concludes the matter of the holocaust is a simple sentence thus matter that can be discussed freely as long as you are supporting and believing it but when a single doubt or questioning of the tiniest detail of it is raised it is met with a ruthless campaign against the person or entity that spoke it with inevitable destruction and this is not a natural or acceptable thing from an objective point in a world that is allowed to question and deny anything including flat earthers and those who promote that life is a reult of probabilities and chances and that there is no god behind creation so we can really accept the discussions for such matters despite all the evidence that refutes them  but we are not allowed to question a one sided tale told and forced upon the world by jews it is a basic rule of studying history that one should read both accounts of the different sides for any event as the truth lies somewhere between both sides of the story and that is the fact finding treasure hunt that one has to go through to find the truth yet when it comes to the holocaust there is only one account one universal truth that cant be argued with from a historically objective point this calls for a critical reading since there is no other side of the story to balance it and actually the blowback that comes from questioning it calls for questioning the authenticity of it for this book it doesnt add up so how come the system that was intent on eradicating jews as pests be very intent on evacuating them to retreat together against russian advances when it was known that the war is coming to an end and germany already lost shouldnt this system exterminate those still alive in the camps what use is it for the nazis to go to all this effort to keep them alive so that some of them could survive and live to tell the story of nazi concentration camps i was forced to read this book for work  my review of it is simply to quote norman finkelstein on the subject of wiesel  thanks to elie wiesel we have a distorted and disfigured and frankly meaningless version of the nazi holocaust and we only know about those genocides that serve the interest of the us and israel and we forget the ones that dont so boringabout the holocaustonly read for school lost interest  pages in wasnt expecting this not going to finish it i was so tired of this book that by the end of it i started to side with hitler so the book would end elie wiesel was a fraud he was not a holocaust survivor but stole the identity of another man everything written in this book is a lie and fabrication liar liar pants on fire i know that this is a biography but it was really pieced together poorly tragedy but still not a very polished book a slim paperback of barely more than a hundred pages night is the most grave and heaviest story of sheer depression hopelessness absence of god hell on earth so much weight it drags your heart down towards the point of denying that there was more than half a century ago such a story nothing important or new comes off more as bad fiction rather than nonfiction thank god i dont believe in god because i am going to commit blasphemy  im just gonna say it im just gonna say it  elie wiesel overdoes it wait no i am not saying he didnt suffer not that part elie wiesel overdoes the writing as more competent people than me have pointed out this is a book which has been culled down from a  page historical fiction to a barely  testimonial along its journey of various translations i really think a lot of the nuance has been lost in the process the page on this on wikipedia has this bit  seidman argues that the yiddish version was for jewish readers who wanted to hear about revenge but the anger was removed for the largely christian readership of the french translation in the yiddish edition for example when buchenwald was liberated early the next day jewish boys ran off to weimar to steal clothing and potatoes and to rape german shiksas un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses in the  french and  english editions this became on the following morning some of the young men went to weimar to get some potatoes and clothesand to sleep with girls coucher avec des filles but of revenge not a sign   this is important because the entire tone has been flipped maybe this is a singular instance but this implies so much i wont say whitewash but i really think the years on wiesel has led to him making this a legend this literary tale of what really was human people doing monstrous things in inhumane environments people who follow me will know this quote from iris chang  civilisation is paperthin  wiesel in night tries often too hard to elicit emotions i feel very bad for saying this but he does he writes these over the top dramatic sentences which just do not land they dont land this is my personal opinion that instead he could have just let the moment linger and the horror set in the dramatics only draws us away my favourite parts of the book are when i hear other characters talk or do things too often we are just plopped down and made to hear what wiesel thought about it and he doesnt really offer useful insight he just tries to flap his wings for effect and all it does is lend what may be a true nonfictional account the air of a fairytale because he smooths over characters reduces them to situations and his perspective in a way he actively smothers the characters franek the foremanwho is kind normally but greedy and looking out for himself more than anything else is a genuinely interesting character but all we get to know of him is through eisels eyes and his assumptions about him he is reduced to his two incidents with the author maybe i ask too much how can a man tell you about other real people whom he never got to know  but look iris chang in her book offers a captivating duality of matsui iwane the general of the rape of nanking while she says that he is guilty and deserved death she also doesnt fail to highlight that some onlookers say he was genuinely distressed by the massacre but just didnt act  what ends up here is that elie turns a horrific true story into a parading of his literary writing skills which arent nearly as good as he thinks them to be it reduces the narrative and i cant help but imagine how much better this would have been if he had adapted a more strict approach to either side he could have written a formal account which would be more terrifying just for stating the facts as it happened and letting you figure out how men can act like that or he could have written a fictional account with broader characterisation which would have brought true humanity and suffering to the table in his attempt to glorify his suffering and stretch it pompously to losing faith in godwhich look if done right would have been fucking amazing he only destroys the horrific reality of the situation and lends fact to fiction instead of the other way just a reminder that this man was a racist disgusting vile person yes he suffered through the holocaust but he felt it was okay to discriminate against other races such as was done to him only giving it  star cause its a fake memoir elie wiesel wasnt a holocaust survivor but a fake and there is online more than enough documentation to testify that this book is totally fabrication and lies i actually thought the book was beautifully written then i learned that this was not autobiographical as was claimed this book was really bad  jaibowl i read this for english so i didnt really have a choice i suppose this was one of those books that you either loved or hated and i hated it  no it had nothing to do with me undermining the experience gone through by elie wiesel who am i to say what he went through was nothing compared to insert examples i am not a holocaust denier or a conspiracy theorist neither am i the kind who likes to give scale to human suffering  i hated this book for the simple reason it was very very depressing if it was not very short i would not have finished it as it was i finished it in record time  hours because i knew if i made it go past  hours there was every chance i would take months to finish it but this was a memoir a real experience so i found it hard to criticise it the way i did a fictional work this was personal  but i guess the thing that depressed me the most was elies treatment towards his father i grew up with old people see so i would tell you honestly that i had softer spot for the old than i did the kids while there was no denying that elie loved his father and tried and hoped so badly to make sure they were not separated he was not always kind towards his father in the end it became a survival of the fittest for him and he reached a point where he believed if his father was dead he would not be encumbered by any burden and had better chance in fending for himself  but was elie to be blamed for this at one side was a boy barely  and we know how teenagers are they were rebellious they were selfish  i know at some point i was they did not have the patience that came with age and experience and the concentration camp condition did not stifle but only exacerbated this and at the other side was the cruelty of concentration camp itself but even without me or anyone judging if he was cruel towards his father or not i think elie already lived in the guilt and grief he felt towards his father in some ways the memoir was probably his channel to that feeling of guilt for elie did not seem to make any effort to embellish over his behaviour towards his father instead he told his story in a way that made us readers saw all his fault and defect as a son he had prayed to the god he no longer believed that he would make him patient but in the end he failed the test  it was sad for someone to pray to the god that he already condemned as powerless and cruel and i guess that was the most depressing of all for i no longer understood the reason behind his desire to continue living he had nothing no family that would be waiting for him there were but he did not know it so it was beside the point no home and his father he had given up as a doomed cause above all no god so why did he want to live so much was it in his way an act of defiance so he could tell god that despite all that he had done to him he had chosen to keep on living i really cannot understand i hate this book it retarded he should have had someone write it for him i cant understand half of the things he is saying too morose his book should have only been  pages the whole gist of the book he could have said in one paragraph im supposed to read this in class and im not that excited  there are so many books that tell this time is history so well unfortunately this isnt one the story is weak the characters flat and the dialogue thin wwii themed books are my favourite but this is just so badly written  i developed zero connection with the characters and the language is just plain and dry at time i was reading this book i was going through a huge stage of personal interest and research in the holocaust nazi germany and world war ii ive read several other holocaust survivor diaries books and stories and the one wiesel wrote didnt grabbed touched or moved me in anyway here it is important to note that i went through a lot of other material on the subject so any new things didnt pop out here for me  i know its quite controversial to say things like that with although respect to the man the events and the history of what happened but my opinion is based upon how this book is written and how its positioned in history in regards to levi primo  is this a man wiesel loses himself in a religion paradox and crisis which keep popping up through the book and for me personally blocks the real sense and soul of the events throughout the book i got a feeling that wiesel is giving jews another connotation than humans where levi primarily writes about the destiny and fate of other human beings apart from religion wiesel goes on and on about his religion its his own opinion and i respect it very much im happy ive read it but again it did not move me and from a more literature way of seeing things the book was badly written  i know the book has been subject to many attacks as being labelled as a fraud and i dont think this is the case but because the book lacks a good psychological flow a philosophical entry that makes the author deal with his past and the things mentioned above make it no surprise to me that it has been in a case of being labelled as fraud all by all its good this book is out there and theres many discussion about it and i wanted to try to respectfully share my opinion  to anybody planning on reading a holocaust survivors book i strongly recommend primo levi  is this a man and dont read it once but read it twice it will tear you down make you feel uncomfortable and conflict your own soul to those involved victim or perpetrator and that is what a book about the subject should do  such a heartbreaking poignant piece of narration it is very eloquent but heres a single star read the rest of my review if interested in the reason why  as usual wwii stories especially memoirs recording firsthand experiences like this one do deserve nobel prize but reading the authors speech that sympathises with literally every human cause except for palestine because the author himself had faith in israel and asked for it to be given a chance is so messed up we could change the names and the places in the memoir to arab names and it would simply tell the story of what israel has done to palestinians from a displaced hungry orphaned palestinian point of view yet the author fails to sympathise with his peers in suffering against the terrorist state of assassins replicating what had been done to them  i initially started reading this piece to teach to my high school students the difference between antisemitism and antizionism but the great piece of writing failed me once it was compared to the voice of the author as a nobel laureate  fuck israel fuck terrorists all around the world free palestine and all the oppressed around the world and glory to all the fallen humans including wwii jews and those who never oppressed others after they survived
Gone with the Wind,having a hard time slogging through the blatant racism in this book times sure have changed and thank god for that  okay nearly forty years since i first read it the epic love story set against the brutality of the civil war still manages to sweep me up  but the racism still wrankles especially the glorification of the ku klux klansouthern gentlemen had no other choice they werent bullies terrorizing people because of the color of their skin they were protecting their women from the rapacious appetites of the newly freed slaves  mitchell says more than once that the blacks were like children and couldnt manage without whites taking care of them theres a part in the book where she describes how scarletts mother ellen would evaluate the negro children selecting the best and the brightest to be house servants the others would be taught a trade and if they failed at that they become field hands as the best and the brightest of the race the house servants were the ones who stayed with their masters apparently aware of their own limitations  and yet this is a book about a strong woman who actively defies the strictures for women of her time scarlett runs tara she becomes successful at business she bosses grown men around even though she was taught that a lady must hide her intelligence and always appear subservient and helpless around men since they had little if any rights that was the only recourse for women at the time  i find it ironic that ms mitchell never realized that just as the women were playing the role of fragile creatures subservient to the fathers and husbands their black slaves were doing the same thinghiding their abilities and intelligence because they had no other choice  something else my daughter is reading gwtw and commented everybody dies i explained that during the civil war  men died and just like the tarletons families lost all their sons a good reason not to go to war  whew i read this book almost a decade ago in high school and wow did i lack racial awareness then while the main character of this book did make me feel some kinda way id recommend checking out this review to understand how problematic this book is in its conceptualization and description of slavery and black people in general   when you educate yourself your opinion can change as mine has for this book  original review from   i dont know where to start it took me exactly two weeks to read this  page novel and after all of the heartbreaking loss and squealworthy romance these characters have experienced i can only say that there is a reason why this book is a classic even if youre not a fan of romance drama historical fiction etc you need to read this book you really do  above is the tidy little summary of how i feel about gone with the wind now im going to go into further detail about why i loved this book  but even after three hours a workout session and a delicious smoothie im not sure it will sound right my heart shattered three times just reading the last fifty pages  scarlett oh i love this girl i could write a  word essay about scarlett ohara with pleasure i dare say that margaret mitchells greatest accomplishment with gone with the wind is the characterization of scarlett the headstrong and haughty protagonist i cant even begin explaining why i adore her so much without divulging plot details or letting loose a rant the size of the typical terms and conditions page seen so often yet ignored too it requires serious skill to make the main character of a book selfish stubborn and sometimes completely unlikeable  but mitchell pulls it off effortlessly  now im no expert on history or the civil war but mitchells take on this time period shocked me she portrayed the south in an entirely different way than i was taught in school and her grasp of the events that occurred is amazing how she showed the loving relationships between slaves and their owners how she cast the kkk as not just a hate group against negroes and how she connected scarletts moral degradation with the fall of the south  its simply superb  though the sheer size of this book may seem intimidating dont be scared  its worth every word  crossposted from my blog the quiet voice one book i can honestly say that i enjoyed less than the movie in margaret mitchells book scarlett has no redeeming qualities whatsoever i spent the better part of the book wanting to slap her silly never reread your childhood favorites especially if its gone with the wind  im on page  and unfortunately i just dont feel it so i need to give a context  im not american i wasnt educated in us schools and for the longest time all i knew about american civil war was from this book so now living in the usa following its politics learning about its history and about lost cause having read toni morrison frederick douglass marlon james ida bell wellsbarnett reading this is like reading alternative reality fantasy a racist one  its a world where slave owners are kind and honorable slaves are never raped abused or killed but are taken care of because they are childlike slaves are not afraid of their owners families are not torn apart but scarletts father spends a lot of money to buy his slaves new wife and her daughter from the neighboring plantation even though he doesnt need her just for his slave to be happy slaves are never flogged and scarletts mother goes in the nights to doctor them and all her free time shes sewing the new clothes for them one popular review said they appreciated nonabusive portrayal of slavery in this book and i dont i guess  i heard of course about racism in this book but i thought i could still read it for the two topics i was curious about mitchells mother was a suffragist and mitchells interest in collecting erotica i was curious how it would influence this story especially considering the prominent romantic subplot but having read  pages i simply dont care enough to continue theres just plethora of great books that are waiting for me and if you want an american epic  i would highly recommend lonesome dove instead of this  on the positive side this book is extremely readable and i was thinking to push through it but why apparently as of  a harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of american readers just behind the bible so i think it wouldnt mind me not enjoying it  so now let me ignore my own advice and go reread the thorn birds two stars this is a vile book the second star is for the vivid characters and because it managed to hold my attention i loved it up to the moment when scarlett and melanie left atlanta and then my dislike grew and grew i realized the book was trying to make me root for a small group of ruthless and privileged people who were supposedly charming beautiful and wellmannered at the expense of others who in turn were supposedly stupid childish and ugly  the way the white southerners were written they sounded stupid and childish too what with the whole well beat yankees into a pulp thing and their contempt for books or philosophy or really anything outside their own little world of plantations and balls and barbecues and as for their good manners they quickly gave way to nastiness and cruelty and by the way being nice and chivalrous only to the pretty delicate white rich girls is really praiseworthy not  the way the black people were written is just unbelievable yes i know this book is a historical novel the overwhelming majority of white people were racist blahblah and i can tell as any reader can whether the author shares certain viewpoint with her characters or not why the fck am i expected to believe that after long days of nursing sick and wounded and tending to a woman in hard labor only the black maid smells badly and her white mistress doesnt  not even after a few days on the road she is only afraid that she might stink and then of course comes to the conclusion that oh no she couldnt have there is a lot of this malicious mean nasty feeling towards blacks who are dirty lazy stupid and also conveniently seem to hate themselves each other and really anyone save for their masters and those whites who are richwellbornpossess many slaves one of the slave women dilcey is proud of her indian blood as it is nobler and better than black  the whole wellbeing of the white protagonists of the book depends on slave labor black or white actually they can put on their high airs because their slaves make it possible of course they feel responsible for those slaves and allegedly never mistreat them not that i believe it but all right the book says so yet there is very little thought given to the whole system its foundation or justification the author criticizes the position of women in society and to be honest i cant even see all that much of feminism in this book because both the author and the society described by her disapprove of the main character but never tries to suggest that slavery might not be that good not once not even one person apart from the baddies gives it any thought whites are better than blacks blacks are happy being told what to do end of story why just fcking because  i dont really know how to phrase it but for me all the famed charm culture values of that beautiful old south is nonexistent obliterated by the pervasive cruelty of the people from the very beginning when the white characters have absolutely no problem with saying stuff like im going to sell you for this and oh yes i was going to buy your wife but i actually sold you to her master instead hur hur hur  and these are jokes which just shows the class of them and of the author it angered and depressed me outright i thought wow how mean then i forgot about it for a little while  there was all the romance and barbecue and intrigues going on  and then when the war came i remembered because it got worse much worse it turned out that despite of all the love and benefits from the planters those nasty ungrateful blacks wanted to be free what a surprise all the poor white planters were seriously oppressed by blacks and blackloving yankees and the situation was so awful that nice white gentlemen in their idealism and chivalry had to establish the ku klux klan  so if the life on the old south was so good why was it so bad yes under all the beauty gentility civilization there is an undercurrent of lies primitivism and filth and it shows phrases like she felt even more helpless than a slave or she worked harder than any field hand prove things against the actual intention of the author the white characters are beyond themselves with anger at the fact that blacks can now vote and possibly against them ah but if you people were so good to them what do you have to fear the constant referring to the blacks as black apes is sometimes done in anger but often as a simple statement oh you know mammy was grieving over bonnies death and she looked like a sad black ape you know what the actual fck this is by the way in the narration and the narrator is anything but subtle and very prone to preaching and so are some of the characters in long blocky paragraphs so the defense along the lines of but such were the times you dont understand simply doesnt hold water no its obvious these were the views of the author who in the era of civil rights was way behind her times im not saying there werent slave owners who treated their slaves decently but the way the book is written youd say these planters were capable of no evil no injustice at all and the system was perfect this is propaganda and not literature  it was enjoyable to a point because i liked reading about the characters and its thanks to the characters i managed to finish the book i didnt care what happened to them though and couldnt sympathize with them due to the fact that there was always the thick wall of blind stupidity behind all of their actions so i cheered at their misfortunes instead i wanted the spoiled but tough scarlett ohara render everyones life miserable down with the noble good guys the impossibly romantic and dashing rhett butler killing a black man because he was uppity to a white woman some other imbecile cutting to ribbons a guy because he told blacks that they were as good as whites the saintly melanie who was in tears at the thought of going north with her family and possibly having to put her little son in the same school as little black children god forbid this is supposed to be enjoyable being around those psychopaths  by the way i really tried to enjoy it but the authors obvious bias just made it impossible for me there were moments when i forgot how unpleasant the characters were how false was the whole world presented  and then bam someone would say something about the corrupted blacks or the author would again start lamenting about the good old times the gentlemen from the kkk the confederation and it was enough to lose all sympathy id had for her vision at this point i would start thinking about pictures from lynchings i once saw  people burned alive tortured to death  and id be like oh go to hell two stars i gave this two stars some people might be baffled frankly im baffled that so many people continue to love it when was the last time you read it did you actually slog through it  let me tell you im disappointed i really started out enjoying the book scarlett was an ass but she is supposed to be it was a simple read but in the beginning the pace kept moving and as a modern day reader the whispers of war were like canon booms in the distance knowing the war was looming gave the book an air of mystery that should have been drawn out after that the story sort of tumbled drunkenly forward alternating between an all too languid crawl and then a quick shuffling of feet with little rhyme or reason  ill discuss some of its merits and how frequently i found them to go hand in hand with the things i didnt like   slavery is wrong ok we know this having read elizabeth keckleys autobiography as well as some underground railroaders i was glad to see how class was a factor even to the slaves field hands and house slavesservants were not equal they did not view each other as equals and when they had good masters they often took pride in their house in this regard i had no problem with pork or mammy being racist or brainwashed or however you want to call it it is what it is this culture was engrained onto them since birth and onto their owners and in the book they were treated well im glad mitchell made a point of discussing this in her works on the other hand at no point in this work is it recognized that some slaves had terrible masters that were physically emotionally and sexually abusive at one point scarlett talks about the horrible fear of being raped by a former slave and how terrible it is that good respectable white women have to live in fear of being raped with no recourse to justice i feel like that would have been an excellent place for the author to say something like and scarlett felt a terrible twinge of guilt wondering if stories she had heard from other plantations had been true and how freeing the darkies may not have been all bad if it had saved innocent servants women who could have been like mammy from living in fear of the abuses of their owner now it would have been inappropriate for scarlett to think this because she is shallow and childish but mitchell could have had melanie point it out or mammy or prissy or some character it is stated multiple times throughout the book that that sort of thing just didnt happen in georgia as if as if any person can speak for every slaves experience in georgia as if mitchell would have heard such terrible and dark stories as she bounced on her fathers knee learning of the good ol prebellum south i kind of find such blindness fifty years after the war to be unforgiveable i expect racism in a book about the civil war south i do not expect blind racism in the author perhaps im unfair and not allowing her to be a product of her environment however the book does not age well as a classic   scarletts character development props to any author who makes their protagonist and foil of the entire story into a loathable monster it takes guts because if you do it wrong people will just hate the story and not the main character its a very delicate balance especially since i would consider gwtw to be a character driven book rather than plot driven scarlett does go through some absolutely fantastic development she goes from a carefree youngster with her personal southern brand of firstworldproblems to a ptsdsuffering goldhoarding broken miser its a believable and realistic transformation given what scarlett had to go through to keep everyone from starving the essence of scarlett remains the same unfortunately these somewhat outward changes really only revolve around money in the beginning and in the end and in essence she never changes she remains very much a child we are told how smart and conniving she is to run these businesses better than a man but we never really see that intelligence manifesting itself too frequently and too often we see her childish nature than cannot comprehend simple thoughts and i found that to become boring quite quickly   im generally against celebrating what was lost in the civil war because what was great and built before came on the backs of one of americas great sins yay pretty dresses and taffeta and slaves doing my hair  you cannot celebrate the social ease of the south without recognizing the evil that bore it forward on a lighter note i dont see that much to celebrate i certainly dont want my relatives coming and staying with me for a month at a time or be forced to eat before a beautiful meal so that i look like a prim and proper lady or be forced to have few opinions of my own it sounds terrible exhausting and justtheworst i dont like being forced to wear panty hose as a social norm at my job to have to wear nothing but black for several years because a family member died and not be allowed to grieve and heal properly is a tragedy   melly is the only redeemable character in the book ashley is absolutely pathetic and you spend most of the book wanting to give the sad little nerd a wedgie perhaps i should give mitchell props for bringing out the bully in me because i really just want to beat him with something on the other side of things we have rhett i dont really know what we are supposed to think of rhett he is an abusive lecherous drunk he is an ass he sees through the to the heart of things but he is a terrible person he starved his countrymen he made money off the desolate soldiers and a few months at the end of the war is going to redeem those actions for me sorry he kills a black man for being too forward to a white lady was that supposed to be chivalry spoiler at the end he makes this grand speech to scarlett about how much he had loved her truly loved her but she exhausted the resources of his soul and he franklydoesnt give a damn anymore he says that he could never have admitted that he loved her because she would have used it as a weapon against himbut there were so many times that she was ready and realizing that she loved him she was excited to be pregnant with his child she realized that her and ashley were just friends there were times that she looked to him and in those moments he was usually excessively cruel and jeering how was she ever supposed to realize that she loved him he was vile she was vile they deserved their misery in one another its just a shame that they had children there is more so much more there were about  pages in this book where i actually cared what happened to the characters how the plot would development and was anxiously waiting to see what happened next and then there were the other  pages and those pages were full of hohumming eye rolling and tsking i do not get it having not seen the movie of this much acclaimed classic and after reading the good reviews it received i thought this was a sure shot a novel which wouldnt disappoint how wrong i was well i tried really hard to get into the story but as i kept reading i couldnt help but starting to loathe the main character the famous scarlett she is the antiheroine a spoiled infatuous and selfish creature who only thinks of herself and of her needs not caring about what or who she has to sacrifice to get her wishes done she is cold hearted ruthless and without a bit of sympathy in her body when you first meet her in the novel she is barely sixteen and i expected to witness a gradual change on her character as she grew up and went through hardships but alas no she remains the same hateful creature until the end of the novel she shows complete lack of loyalty honour or compassion she only cares about herself and manages to make life miserable for those who dare to love her god knows why sorry but i couldnt get into the novel when i saw the story through the eyes of such an odious person  i have to say though that this is a well researched historical novel about the american civil war in which you can understand the end of a way of living and the beginning of the modern times in the states the facts are accurately exposed and you can see several sides of the story through different characters so that at least deserves one star but i wasnt looking for only a historical novel but also for engaging characters which i couldnt find i couldnt care less about what finally happened to scarlett when i disliked her that much and i think she still got more than she deserved wont be seeing the movie either im not hating this but i also dont care enough to continue i really tried and its mildly interesting to me but just barely and there are so many things i want to readdo more than read something thats feeling like a  star read that is also very racist its somewhat interesting wanting to shake scarlett and see her shenanigans and i know its a classic and to a degree i can even see why but its not for me and i need to stop trying to push myself through a classic i really dont wanna read forgot to add dnf at  not to be sexistbut this probably is more of a womans book i think if you look up chicklit in the dictionary they have a picture of this bookbut i could be wrong in equal parts i adore and abhor this novel its scale story and prose are breathtaking while its direct  indirect racism is sickening and abhorrent this was written in the s and sets a historically inaccurate context of a world where the civil war was not really about slavery its about state rights economics and southern pride but fails to connect that all of those issues are only under pressure because of slavery the blacks in the south were all happy being slaves the kkk is justified in hanging people for being uppity and it promotes the central ideal of jim crowism ex post the war scarletts biggest fear is that tara may be bought by white trash who would commit the biggest sin by having black and white people eat at the same table intermarry and have black folks sleep in the rooms in the mansion  this book should go out of circulation much like the song of the south and its a shame because otherwise this really would have been one of the greatest novels ive ever read okay this may make me totally unpopular but  this book is so racist it makes my blood boil  the plot races forward the characters are welldeveloped although not necessarily likable but it is soooooooooooo racist i nearly couldnt finish it whenever anyone says this is one of their favorites i have to wonder why i consider starting a debate but then i just hold my tongue  isnt there a phrase about the tragic necessity of the klan what in the what and the depiction of black people as ignorant and helpless little children  hello no stinkin way i just cant go for that sorry everyone update  alright so im almost  pages in and im not overly impressed before i am lambasted for what is most assuredly southern sacrilege let me explain   i absolutely loathe scarlett she has almost zero redeeming qualities she is selfcentered cruel manipulative and vain laughably she keeps telling herself that she wants to be just like her mother but then does everything entirely the opposite of what her mother would do and even when someone she dislikes does something nice for her she doesnt amend her previous impressions she merely uses that niceness as proof that person is annoying as all hell or strangely manipulative  also shes not remotely intelligent the few things shes actually said generally revolve around clothing or else are some variant of fiddlededee or its just not fair oh yes she also calls rhett a rascal and scoundrel a lot  the one redeeming quality i can sort of give her at this point is that shes willing to break out of restrictive social conventions  but even that is done to her own selfish ends or else brought on at rhetts prompting   i know its an urban legend that mitchell sold her soul to the devil in exchange for writing the most perfect novel ever and that many regard the socalled transaction as paid in full if thats the case the devil is not terribly succinct read  pages of scarlett in her mourning dress saying some variant of its not fair and youll know exactly what im talking about  all that said the only two things keeping me interested at this point are  rhett simply because hes much richer as a character than anyone else in the book and  the possibility that scarlett will have some sense shaken into her im not holding my breath on that one  whew had to get that out more later    update  finished and yet  most of my initial critiques still hold following the war  the description of which in my mind is where mitchell is at her best  the pace picks up substantially but its still one long chain of bad things happening to scarlett and she forebears in spite of all after about  pages of this it gets pretty damned old  i also found scarlet and rhetts relationship almost completely unbelievable the courtship was realistic enough but once theyre married it seems pretty impossible to me that scarlett couldve been so blind to rhetts motivations or that just once they let on to each other in some way that they do actually care for one another  and the ending oh the ending i just wanted to slap scarlett at the end well i wanted to do it several times throughout but especially at the end i think i actually rolled my eyes when i finally turned the last page  to sum up the book bad things happen to scarlett she manages to persevere but only at the cost of the feelings of others repeat ad nauseum oh yeah and theres a war i read a little blurb by margaret mitchell that came in my edition explaining the book was about resilience im so glad i did because without that word from the author i think i wouldve missed her point entirely the other measures id ordinarily use to evaluate a book and had been using here make this a very mediocre novel as a character study scarlett ohara is a very unpleasant antiheroine to spend  pages with she doesnt develop throughout the novel to be fair this is purposeful but makes for a long haul and much of the narrative around her is clumsy very heavyhanded in its hints and allusions and she is written to be nasty and selfabsorbed as a history piece it is extremely racist biased southrationalizing and did not feel wellresearched as a piece judged on writing style it is pedestrian as a plotdriven novel its okay kind of a runofthemill epic but as a book about resilience i think it was very successful  the shining spot of light in this book is rhett butler he is dynamic rich complex and his dialogue crackles through the entire book i fell in love with him a hundred times and hated him almost as many he is exactly what she wrote him to be and he is one of the great characters of american literature the ending also is very strong and the scenes with melanie wilkes were almost a triumph if only she had been a shade less timorous it took me three months at least as many breaks including a slight delay when i left it in vermont and a lot of frustration but i finished it  heres the reason for my rating one star is because you have to start with one star it is a book that i finished and therefore it gets a star but the other star is because despite it being about a thousand pages too long a literal thousand im not being hyperbolic here it was a reasonably wellwritten book for its time the voice was consistent throughout and the characters were always true to themselves even when themselves were horrible  but scarlett ohara is the most selfish human being i have ever read about in my entire life strongwilled and reasonably clever sure but horrible i thought i would be rooting for her i thought i would want someone to love her back but she was so misguided about her judgement about everyone  everyone  that i just wanted her to find herself but she never did shell think about that tomorrow  im glad i read the book instead of seeing the movie because i dont think i could handle watching her be a horrible person to melly the true hero of this story nor could i watch pretty much any of the events that transpired in the last  pages of the book but mostly im glad its over i know this book is a classic and i know a lot of people love itbut frankly my dear i dont give a damn let me start by saying that my problem with this book is with scarlett ohara margaret mitchell was an amazing writer and i found her prose to be fascinating i even liked rhett butler in fact the only characters i didnt like were scarlett and ashley scarlett had no heart while ashley had no backbone melanie was the sweetest person i have ever read about she is the true heroine of the story as she is the one who teaches scarlett how to love i did like that scarlett grew towards the end but she was for the most part a nasty southern belle who had no right to be called a lady so why did i dislike this so much after all i did like vanity fair and that has a nasty heroine im not really sure maybe because she is looked upon as being so wonderful by characters in the book whatever it was i did not enjoy it however i did like the movie which i saw a week afterwards i think that if i should ever pick this up again i might change my view point i believe that had i seen the movie first it would have made all the difference and the ending is full of hope leaving romantics like me to create an epilogue i read this for the first time when i was twelve even then i knew it was racist but i was young and dumb enough to be able to ignore it now that im not twelve the horrible racism stuff just poisons the rest of the book for me also now that ive read eric foners seminal work on reconstruction and i know how historically inaccurate gwtw is its hard to view this book as anything but ridiculously bad if not kind of evil but i dont want to give it that much credit after all in real life the klu klux klan were not heroes the northern soldiers were not complete barbarians many southern soldiers were quite dishonorable nathan bedford forrest massacaring surrended black troops and oh yes the slaves were not at all happy about slavery and anxious to remain enslaved so basically yuck im sadly disappointed in this book its also distressing to know so many of whom this book is a favorite with great reviews sadly though this definitely was not the book for me i found that the only reason i read it through was because of the richness of history that saturated the story  though i have read much better stories that had taken place during the civil war the story was painfully drawn out and too long however i am glad that ive read this book as this is an american classic as for recommendations  dont bother to pick up this book if youre looking for any kind of happy endings or even closure to the story finishing this  page novel i was only left with this thought gone with the wind is easily the most blatantly racist book ive ever read not just from one or two characters but from every character plus the author i know it was a different world but holy wow the dialogue yet gone with the wind was also a very entertaining pageturner of a melodrama that i couldnt put down i cant even rate this i feel so conflicted  i have never had a book try to sell me on the notion that black people didnt mind being enslaved and that they were to be handled as children ive not read many books that featured their snooty heroine as somebody who basically forgot about her own children yet eventually became hardworkingbut still had such contempt for the outside world and anyone who was different than her maybe when judgmental people call women who dont want kids selfish theyre thinking of scarlett theory still in progress i did
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4)",dont mind me just crying my eyes out  this was way better than i remember it being and i remember it being pretty darn good jk rowling is a writing goddess and i cant believe how much foresight and planning went into this series she already hints at the horcruxes and many other things in this book that dont show up until much later definitely one of my favorites in the series but i say that about all of them um wow yeah that was freaking fantastic probably my favorite so far just wow oh my goshwhat even i feel empowered and sad at the same time sad becauseyou know  stars of course after a steady build the series hits its stride deep and layered it goes down smooth never seeming overly complex one of my favorites in the series  the ending always gets to me and breaks my heart a tone transfiguration its so the boygirl drama bright to start but breaks your heart and ends in tears and trauma there is an incredibly somber mood that descends on me every time i finish this book in the series and reading it with the illustrations did nothing to change that i felt the drawings were impeccable and i loved how some of the characters were reimagined to look a different way than portrayed in the movies my favorite being mad eye moody now the long wait for the remainder of the illustrated editions i know what you think dont i have anything to do instead of rereading  paged long book on my weekend of course i am i could try to cook breads cakes muffins or any other carbs involved project and share at my social media account to risk myself turn into thors big bellied image at last avengers movie for consuming them incessantly like my most friends do till the quarantine ends it will end eventually right wait a minute i cannot do that i can only pose with burned or overcooked things if i insist to cook  i can also resume home soccer matches with my husband dearest but there is nothing left called glass at our place and i am still stressed walking barefoot because there may be still a tiny threatening glass piece hid somewhere waiting for me  and of course after ozark la casa da papel tiger king and unorthodox i couldnt find any appropriate content match with my taste im already working on three books but on weekends im suffering from melancholy and i prefer to do something make me happy in the past  like keep watching shaun of the dead big lebowski and fight club interestingly at your each rewatching sance youre catching another detail i already told third book is my favorite because it was the last piece that my three musketeers keep their innocence till they take their first steps to the dark side  and this book is the beginning of the dark side this is the middle part of long installment a big death will shake them to the cores and everything about their life will change forever this is one of the darkest more action packed gripping thrilling but also heartbreaking book of the series when i first read it nearly  years ago i didnt get intimidated when i see the page numbers on contrary i felt blessed because normally i have been finishing a harry potter novel in a day at least i finished the first three books in one day correction first book took me only half day thanks to my fast reading technique i improved at college yearsbooks longevity was great news i could spend more time in harry potters world  after reading the whirlwind quidditch cup competition parts i adored blooming creativity and visionary scenes written by jkr i went back to my younger dumber self and remembered the times how i cherished the chapters how i thrilled when harry succeeded and how i flabbergasted after reading the shocking ending  i adored it again and i promised myself to read it another  years later  i hope i wont be at quarantine next time  i recommend you to read the books give you time travel to your happy times at the past so you can handle the daily terrors and find the strength to carry hope into your near future thats why jkr is one of my all time favorite authors i is a good elf  its been proven three times now that i always get ahead of myself when reviewing harry potter incorrectly concluding the last one out of the ones ive read so far to be the best but it cannot be helped the standards are moved up  again its like rowling just had a look at the first books found them to be way too short and came up with this one which is much longer than the previous ones  combined and the writing style keeps on improving while plot getting more and more thrilling making it oh so delightful to read  will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only singlemalt whiskey  its great to have that feeling of how easy it is to read everything is still being part of the authors narration though the events are being described in much more detail it does not take away anything in terms of interest on the contrary the reader is kept well in suspense with a number of twists without making anything too unreal relative to the world of magic that is i dont recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one again im probably getting ahead of myself  alfgiant moi iave  iave big bone  as far as the environs go i think its safe to say that weve arrived at darker times toward which the third book made way for though i loved the first three relativelytroublefree years this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters and the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much i dont think ill be able to rest well until im done with the series i kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years who had to wait year after year for the next book mustve felt being under crucio  if you want to know what a mans like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals this was the beginning of my addiction to potter i had previously experimented with and enjoyed potter on  different occasions but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again then under some pressure from some potterhead peers of mine i tried the newest blend called the gobletand everything changed as the warm easy potato chip prose crossed my bloodbrain barrier euphoria ensued my inner child was smitten  iwashooked and iwashappy  ignore the socalled experts who say potter is brain cell killing pap dont listen to those jaded book snobby squares most of them are wound so tight they wouldnt know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled  potter makes you feel good potter makes you smile potter makes you joyous and giggly hell potter makes you want to use the word giggly  potter is enjoyable and fun thats enough for me  so what made the goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the potter i had tried part of it was that i had already seen the movies up through order of the phoenix before i got my hands on genuine potter the first  were fun but i felt like i had already been there done that as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen still enjoyable but not enough to put the potter monkey on my back  then came the goblet of potter and it was a big huge tightlyrolled fatty at  pages the cut diluted movie strain couldnt hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel it was completely addictive the worldbuilding details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth add that to rowlings breezy ear friendly prose and i found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more  its high praise indeed when i say that  pages did not contain a single dull ploddy moment this was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience it deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of ya fantasy  is it popcorn certainly is it a joy to read definitely is it one i highly recommend to all lovers of feel good comfort food yes one of my favourites  all the thrills mysteries the competition more lovely characters some more jerks too that i wanted to hit their heads at the wall that ending  now im writing this after many times reread i exactly remembered my first reaction after finishing this book after that horror in the end of the book i was awestruck why this book is over give me more  then there was no book  you see the pain after the biggest plot twists of the series which i was looking forward to it so much i had to wait harry potter series was my first in many things my first novel my first fantasy my first book crush  one of them was my first cliffhanger   this book is the point that the world started to getting darker  a little out of meremiddlegradeish part not that previous books were childish but theyre fun  cute  the protagonists are younger suitable for both kids  young readers but now things getting more serious  dark i love how rowlings slowly revealing the wizarding worlds secrets to us each book has something new about the world we have time to process the interesting new info  remember it later the complete opposite of infodump  i believe its a talent  here its about the first war  you know whos followers  rituals were also about to see the quidditch world cup fudge was so funny here  getting more information about the magical educations around the world  the plot we knew something were off but we cant exactly pinpointed it until the end when the truth revealed rowling knows how to reveal a plot twist in the most shocking way she actually proved it a few times in book     but still surprising how brilliant it is  harrys suddenly in trouble  he doesnt know how i like krum  all the predicaments the trio should struggle through made by rita skeeter bullies  the mean students but they didnt cower or hide they held their head high  ignoring them  i always loved villains in disguises they are interesting  cunning  we cant tell until they revealed their secrets the feel of bewildered betrayal the hero going through  the writing style is fun as always comparing to book one it has improved a lot now its graceful  rich the villains chapter was the best villainishnotharryrelated pov in the whole series intriguing  spooky  the movie was good but didnt do the justice toward the book it felt so rushed  deleted many parts of the book i wouldve liked to see the quidditch world cup final match on the screen the real interesting rd task  the sphinx the hilarious scenes by ludo dobby winky  her story or showing the stubborn stupid refusal of that gargoyle to accept the truth  the cleavage in the society in the end  while fans are angry about dumbledore asked calmly part that turned out the total opposite in the movie  i totally laughed at that part everytime i reach that moment in either the book or the movie im mad at how movie harry acted outofcharacter in one scene in the movie just because increasing the thrills i suppose when he did exactly the opposite in the book english harry potter and the goblet of fire  italiano  the villagers of little hangleton still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there maybe this time i was out of line with the bedtime reading to my daughter not so much for the size of the book but for its darker content compared to the previous ones towards the end of this fourth book in the harry potter series my little girl had difficulty falling asleep i had to defuse the situation the quidditch world cup is coming and harry ron and hermione have the chance to watch the final round before the start of the new school year this time problems start even earlier than the end of the summer vacation far from the walls of hogwarts many pages many events the new defense against the dark arts teacher the triwizard tournament the tasks to face there is always something to understand some mystery to unveil great food for our potterian curiosity but be warned dumbledore warns us  curiosity is not a sin but we should exercise caution with our curiosity caution easy to say he had no memory of ever being hugged like this as though by a mother the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs weasley held him to her his mothers face his fathers voice the sight of cedric dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him    my heart broke for harry several times the childhood traumas hes suffered are too much too unfair  dumbledore will always remain the baddest son of a bitch the end of these books remain pure gold because of him  cornelius fudge represents trump nicely in this book  am i the only one that still doesnt hate snape my guy has been living a double life his whole life still a dick but you know a redeemable one  hermoine figuring out rita skeeters secret was a proud moment  i love that harry gave the weasley twins his winnings   my love for this series just knows no bounds it might take me  more years to finally make it through this series but whateverits called savoring people lol i remember the first time i read this  id just started a real crappy job that i came to hate id dropped out of university after my first year because my degree in psychology was a terrible choice i seemed to be making more enemies than friends through life but none of that mattered because i was reading a great series of books i had something to look forward to every day when i really needed it  the point is books are escapism and fantasy books particularly so as i got my shit together this book helped me move on and get through life as so many other books have since  as harry ron and hermione entered their fourth year of hogwarts arguably their most challenging and intense year yet i checked my mail box to see if my invite had finally arrived  it hadnt  it still hasnt  maybe one day i really dont think i need to tell yall that i loved this because ive been raving about this series since the moment i started it back in january but for the sake of clarity  i love this  i believe everyone even people that have no attachment to it at all has a harry potter story under their belt whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the weasleys or when their potterhead teacher made them play quidditch in gym class everyone has some kind of hp story they whip out at dinner parties  this is mine  back in my early teens after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiotself being too sophisticated for magic yes yearold grace was an asshole  that isnt the story i was a camp counsellor but i wasnt a counsellor at any ordinary camp oh no i was a counsellor at a theatre camp each year we would put on a different musical and the year i was  it was decided we would do a childfriendly dumbed down version of the goblet of fire complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from a very potter musical  i played james potter helped countless kids memorize their lines choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points i picked up of the entire musical was the yule ball and cedric diggorys death  the whole time i was reading this book   years later  all i could think about was that musical and what i knew was coming because of it i was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened   years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and id say it was  satisfying  this book is masterful it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page it maintained the classic spirit of books  while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness also like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection i want to curse yearold grace for being an idiot and yearold grace for not paying attention at work because boy oh boy do i wish i read this series sooner we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided  the summer is dragging and harry cant wait to join the weasleys and hermione at the burrow and go with them to the international quidditch cup final  its harrys fourth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year will be different to the previous ones for hogwarts will be hosting the triwizard tournament a competition which hasnt been hosted for a century a contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks only students of age are allowed to compete in  description  harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the hogwarts champion is what harry doesnt expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events  description    for me this is where the story really picks up the games as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling you cant help but want to know what happens next and how harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him  if you want to know what a mans like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals   the introduction of foreign wizardswitches in this book sets this one apart from the others i absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual british magical community and the rivalry that is usually present at hogwarts between the houses is ampedup  description  i really felt for harry he faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends i dont know how he deals with everything honestly  it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be    our trio are growing up i loved those scenes with harry and ron struggling to communicate with girls  their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet  i always associate this book with magical christmassy vibes it just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series  description  whats comin will come an well meet it when it does  description    buddy reading with snapes brother  description here i am in march  it is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us i have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat all on slightly different schedules and i am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment i wish i did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use under normal circumstances i would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for passover the dual rites of spring but  is hardly normal with a new temporary normal upon us i decided to reread harry potter along with two of my kids who are embarking on rereads of their own as the series grows progressively darker there is also the underlying presence of hope in these dark times we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives and like an old friend harry is there for us  if harry potter were real life harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at hogwarts with important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education dark forces are gathering as had been predicted throughout the first three books with his servant returned to him lord voldemort is determined to rise again more powerful and lethal than ever before harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar his connection to voldemort has bothered him over the summer reaching out to his father figures it is apparent to all that voldemort is gathering strength and harry represents the best chance to conquer him that is if he can get through a year at hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education with these forces both inside and outside of hogwarts building up determined to do harry in the fourth year at hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet  with summer vacation nearly over harry returns to his friends rons house named the burrow to see the final of the quidditch world cup rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has starting with the eldest weasley brothers bill and charlie ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother and now we see that bill and charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school this theme of it measuring up to either harry or his brothers stays with ron for the rest of the series and undoubtedly for the rest of his life here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks we find another form of transportation a portkey an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly of course a portkey will reappear later in the book as rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on the scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world the color and innocence of childhood is about to end and then harry ron hermoine and their contemporaries return to another year at school  professor dumbledore introduces the tri wizard tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies one must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire which is guarded by dumbledores age line fred and george would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons which they would love to start a joke shop even they are no match for dumbledores advanced magic somehow someone who wants harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire although only fourteen harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions his friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of voldemort the tasks in the tournament which include battling dragons mer people and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should voldemort return to power harry exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome voldemort on multiple occasions represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating voldemort again here as the arc of the series reaches its apex it is obvious that harry will be destined to fight voldemort again the education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle  rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well fred and georges determination to create jokes ron and hermoines growing relationship which comes to a head at the yule ball the foul reporter rita skeeter readers acquire more magical knowledge as well dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve this object will continue to play a role throughout the series but here we learn about the trials against voldemorts supporters during his first downfall we find new information about nevilles family as well as professor snape and wonder whose side he is really on something that isnt resolved until the end hagrid notes that whatever comes will come and rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever house elves and giants play a prominent role dementors bide their time to rejoin voldemort and sirius returns to play his role as harrys godfather to the best of his ability sirius presence throughout this book tethers harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure taking his place as the family harry never had and reminding harry the need to defeat voldemort once and for all  three long books remain as i am at home with more time than i anticipated to read this series i may finish sooner than later it is always bittersweet as i reach this turning point in the series as hagrid tells harry to brace for darker days ahead just as we are doing in real life now my kids and i are here for the long haul both in our new reality of  and on harrys journey to eradicate darkness we will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers even though this may mirror what is going on in real life at least for those hours that we are immersed in harrys world we are experiencing a world other than our own a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later like i have already mentioned in my review of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban it is definitely noticeable that rowlings writing style has improved massively compared to the first two books in the series the amount of suspense and foreshadowing was incorporated very well and made the reading experience so much fun i found myself constantly holding my breath towards the end there were so many twists and turns i have actually seen the movie version before but i forgot much of it so i was extremely surprised at some of the reveals the build up towards those situations was just perfect  i loved that we got to see a bit more interaction between muggles and wizards in the beginning as well as more scenes outside of hogwarts it was a nice change and helped bring a bit more realism to the story it was nice to see that wizards and witches get excited over such a normal thing as a sport event too  one of my favorite things in the book was the portrayal of friendship harry ron and hermione were depicted as normal teenagers who sometimes just happen to fight over the stupidest little things i feel like that really brought their friendship forward in a way i in general feel like there was a lot of progress and development in the book i havent read the following books yet so i obviously cant say how much of what happened in this one will play a part later but i still feel like i learned so many new things about the world this story takes place in and about the characters in it and oh man how much i just love those characters reread in december  for harryxmastoyou  forever sad about winky not being in the movie and rita skeeters whole story not making it in either because shes so awful but justice is served  reread in december  for harryxmastoyou  seriously so many things i forgot because its so different from book to movie its so good still though i loved dobby in this book  reread in december  for harryxmastoyou  again so great lots of things i forgot like ludo bagman as a character the weasleys coming to be harrys family for the third task and just how things actually happen in the book since it varies in the movie things start to get dark after this book normally i congratulate myself for finishing a   page novel but after reading  pages of this book my only reaction was how could it already be overthe more i read harry potter the harder i fall in love with jk rowling i couldnt grasp how she could make this most fantastic series with the most complex and most expertly planned out plot you could tell she was so sure of the story the moment she started writing the first book her attention to detail is more than impressive and the diversity and the realness of her characters are just unbelievable every single character even inanimate ones is fully developed i am just absolutely completely astonished  death had always been a major theme of these books but goblet of fire was really the turning point of the whole series not only did voldemort return but we found out that the wizarding world is much larger and cedric is killed  the characters become more real yet are still stuck in flux between child and adult which is apropos seeing as how this book is literally in the middle of the series is there anyone else out there who thinks goblet of fire was the high point of the whole harry potter series  im just wondering if im strange or something  harry potter and the goblet of fire was my most anticipated read of the series its my favorite movie i know i know the books are so much better and its where the books really start to get intense even though there was a part that brought tears to my eyes its not as sad as whats yet to come  i feel like this book is the book of transitioning for harry ron and hermione this is the last book of their childhood if the movies follow the books as well as i hope shit really starts to get real after this one there is a lot of depth to this story the characters and it gets a bit darker than the first three i love the triwizard tournament aspect and the new characters we meet once again i listened to the audio book and the narration was fantastic if youve never read the books before or your a long time fan i highly recommend these audio books the narrator does a fantastic job i love getting lost in the world of harry potter and cant wait to read more  to be honest it was pretty hard for me to decide how many stars i would give to the book on one hand i liked the book but i didnt love it but on the other hand i felt like i couldnt give it less that  stars because i wouldnt be the kind of woman i am today without this series this series changed me and when i look back at the old version of me i feel i dont really recognize that girl anymore so yeah it was pretty complicated for me to rate this book  i think the reason why i didnt love it because i knew what would happen so the shock was not there anymore but then i loved the second and third book hmmm its pretty confusing when i think about it basically i liked this book but i didnt love it  cedric diggorys death  i cried you know when he refused to take the triwizard cup and he told harry to take it he was just so good and noble and when harry told him to take the cup together i was grinning while crying at the same time because i was so proud of harrys decision but i still cannot accept his death he didnt deserve that kind of death i really hate voldemort and wormtail they deserve a painful death and may them rot in hell for all the evilness they have done honestly i still cant believe that there are death eaters who actually support voldemort like what the fuck voldemort is evil and so freaking bad  snape being mean to hermione  i do not hate snape but there were moments where he just left me gaping with disbelief on my face because he acted pretty mean and annoyed me for example is the moment where harry and malfoy were fighting and they tried to hex or curse each other but malfoys spell caught hermione and hermiones front teeth became longer like very long until they passed her collar but then when snape saw them he said    snape looked coldly at hermione then said i see no difference    i was shocked when i read that part because what did hermione do to deserve that kind of response that was just so mean i felt sorry for hermione right away in that scene i wanted to say to her that its okay the teeth can be fixed and snape was just being bitter  the morning before the third task  i really love the weasley family with no exception percy is my least favorite though this book is indeed a reread for me but i did not remember at all about this scene where harry was told to meet his family before the final task and i totally did not know who would come because the dursleys couldnt possibly come so whos this family and then when i realized that it was mrs weasley and bill my eyes suddenly became teary it was so clear that mrs weasley molly cared and loved harry harry is so lucky to have the weasley family theyre such a nice family and come to think of it how can malfoy mock rons family to me its so absurd the weasley family is a great and i adore this family  thank you for reading and liking this review i really appreciate it and i hope you all have an amazing weekend  bitches really think constantly rereading harry potter to the point that it becomes ridiculous is a personality trait reread  harry potter and the goblet of fire steps up from the previous ones very well its the darkest book ive ever read since harry potter and the sorcerers stone who knows  harry potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibi
The Holy Bible: King James Version,the holy inspired and inerrant word of god i can say no more than read it  i believe in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible  and in one lord jesus christ the onlybegotten son of god begotten of the father before all worlds god of god light of light very god of very god begotten not made being of one substance with the father by whom all things were made  who for us men for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the holy spirit of the virgin mary and was made man and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate he suffered and was buried and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures and ascended into heaven and sits on the right hand of the father and he shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end  and i believe in the holy ghost the lord and giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified who spoke by the prophets  and i believe one holy catholic and apostolic church i acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and i look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come amen the nicene creed this is the only book you need for life this is lifes instruction manual it will give you history answers for every issue of life comfort in times of sorrow encouragment prophecy only book with prophecies that all came true and best of all the truth of why we are here this book is actually made of  books written by  authors over  years it has stood the test of time i encourage anyone to give it a try please do not knock it till you try it and you dont have to start in the beginning try the book of john it is a great place to start i offer a a logical review for you  okay lets be realistic here people who give this book one star are simply biased and blind to the beauty contained in this book whether you believe the theology behind this book or not you cannot deny the power and brilliance it contains the whole idea of living is centered around the idea of love a book with the phrase love you enemy is a book unlike any before it the poetry and proverbs are inspiring and show depth each book has a clearly different writing style yet they all tie together in a cohesive whole the bible is a literary masterpiece it tells us to live selflessly and not store up wealth give to the needy and do good to those that hate you does this sound evil the old testament speaks of what the hebrew people were to do in situations of evil done yet are these not just indicators of evil deserving punishment later it tells man not to take vengeance into their own hands for it is not mans place this book has given purpose and meaning to billions transforming lives and inspiring the hopeless it is the  best seller of all time it is geographically and scientifically sound giving birth to science itself an incredible and riveting read that spans thousands of years still culturally relevant today tell me what is not to like i just finished a   year study of the new testament i think it was my nd time reading it all the way through this nd time through was a much more indepth study i loved my study and i learned so much my favorites parts were reading about paul and then the book of revelation revelation has always fascinated me and so it was very interesting to really dig in and satiate my curiosity one of my favorite verses is in revelations  and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away isnt that awesome i love that as to my thoughts about the apostle paul what an amazing man he had so many trials that he had to live through and overcome but he did not lose his faith in god once and he continually praised god and was always looking for missionary moments what an example to me especially going through the trials that we are currently experiencing  my love for my savior jesus christ increased as well it is hard for me to express in words the feelings i feel towards him i have learned how important the one is to him he went about doing good continually he healed many who were ill both physically and mentally luke  he wasnt too busy with his everyday schedule to take time out for the one how thankful i am for his atoning sacrifice for me i know he loves me and knows me personally the holy bible is the written world inspired by god and written by many who walked and talked with god over the past  years the creation of man mans fall gods plan of salvation the prophets judges kings christ and his disciples and his ordained apostles and their works the bible is the human handbook of instruction for our daily life it holds out hope it teaches truth it shows us the comforter and how to walk uprightly in truth and rightousness it is a book of mystery murder love hate principles parables princess kings queens men and women lovers and those betrayed sex and lust the bible has it all the bible has layers and you can read something again and again and every find something new not understood before and it is the love of god for all humanity and his plan for all the come to salvation of his ultimate gift and grace and salvation for any and all who desire to claim it it is not an easy book it is a book if you want to be a better person you need daily in your life read with a prayer and open mind and let the spirit of god open your eyes to his wonderful plan of salvation hello lesbians not sure if ur aware but not only does this banger contain the book of ruth aka book of milf story of star crossed yearning lesbian luvrs but also the song of solomon an  chapter poem which is actually just butchfemme erotica david and jonathan are also lesbians hope this helps disclaimer this is not a review of the theological and spiritual views about or findings from the holy bible reviewing the context of a religious book should be held in a different forum  this is probably the coolest bible i own published from zondervan in  as the th anniversary edition there is an introduction and commentary from king james hence the name a table of the months and the prescribed prayers for each day a lengthy genealogy about the characters from the old testament and then the old and new testament only thing missing is the apocrypha that is in another  kjv bible i own  this particular  edition has the entire bible written in bold gothicblock lettering which can be challenging at times to read  million bibles are sold every week billion soldno other book comes anywhere near that record  it is unique  i find it strange that some say i dont believe the bible thats like saying i dont believe historygo to the british museum and see for yourself all the artifacts and the biblical references to the places mentioned in the bible  so many lovers of william shakespeare do not seem to be aware of the fact that the bard took part in translating the king james version of the bible into english  like a bit of proof on shakespeares th birthday he translated psalm count  words from the beginning of the psalm and  words from the endhe did it to put his personal mark on this translation  as for the recommendations in the bibleyeah i think its great to love our neighbour as ourselfi think to put others firstinstead of this age of the ego this age of meismis wonderfulimagine thatno war no violence no abuse no stealingwhat was it john lennon wrote about in imagine the holy biblethe book of all books a guidebook for life thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path explicitly shows gods love for humanity in the sacrificial gift of his son  jesus christ explains in simplicity what a man must do to be saved seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail isaiah  the lds edition is great because of the footnotes and reference pages at the back that make it easier to study but as long as its the king james version it is good by me   im not a big fan of all these newfangled bibles where they use hip and simple words there were enough things changed and left out by previous translators i dont think we need more people interpreting and simplifying the word of the lord guys i finished reading this book through the first time in my life yestarday this is crazy im so happy it was my goal to do that this year and i did it celebrate with me i cant wait to start it again and see what it teaches me the second time around i didnt read this book instead heres my review of herbivore a vegan restaurant in san francisco  meat be damned all of the vegan choices encompass hearty sandwiches to creamy milkshakes reasonably priced must have sausage biscuit medley stay away mac and cheese as this year drew to a close i found myself barely able to wait to get the last two chapters of this book i knew there was the glorious revealing of our eternal home still i waited letting the whole story build to its glorious conclusion and what a conclusion after the sorrow illness and pain of this life of history what a hope awaits us could you imagine a better end to the story everything for the believer ending in eternal glory eternal peace eternal joy and eternal comfort that was the comfort i couldnt wait for but first i was awed by the power authority goodness and compassion of our god without that there wouldnt be any assurance behind those amazing chapters our god is so wonderful so unchanging this was the first year that i used a readers bible for the majority of my personal devotions i had no idea how distracting verse divisions can be reading without the distractions caused by those slight distractions was really helpful the flow of ideas was so much clearer i cant recommend finding a readers bible strongly enough it will probably be my goto format for private devotions from now on the only downside was that the editors opted to add syllable divisions and accent marks to every proper name every single one including jesus and david it was highly distracting the reading plan i followed this year had me read the new testament psalms and proverbs twice and the old testament once the bible is my favorite book of all time each new morning as i read god speaks to me through it inspires me leads me helps me and i thank him every day for his beautiful wise word  so this one professor had the bible on the syllabus as assigned reading side by side with greek myths and epics i lamented that i do all my reading on the subway and i didnt really want to tote the bible around on the train one of the girls in my group who was wearing a hijab looked at me and said well how do you think i feel  good point  so i read it on the subway  apparently giant dudes with shaved heads and band tshirts get lots of attention when reading the bible in public curious stares women trying to strike up a conversation and lots of short intense nods of approval  for two weeks in  i felt very righteous people were looking at me with respect intrigue they thought i was passionate enough about my faith that i was desecrating the book with my hot pink hi lighter they didnt even grill me when i did the full body lean against the pole  but then the assignment ended and everything changed i was just the tall mean looking dude again sometimes i wonder what it was about that book that made me so intriguing all of a sudden but then i remember that i hate when random people talk to me on the subway and decide that its all for the best anyway the first time i read this it was interesting but i was confused  the next time i read it i was a christian and it not only made sense  it changed my life god saved me from the bottom of the ocean  this was not written by anonymous there are several authors  but only one that needs attribution god  spoiler alert  god is real this is not a work of fiction rather it is the only work of pure truth the fantasy book that has the most active and arguably hardcore fan base ever you now when nerds fight over which is better star wars or star trek think thats pretty intense well that holds no candle to this bad mother right here list the most brutal gory most transgressive fiction you have ever read and this book makes that look like a nursery book  this book has murder incest talking snakes demons angels monsters all the crazy shit youd want in a crazy book this has it all  this book has been around a thousand years and its book club is still active up to this day this is the most suggested book most influential if you havent read it youre missing out buddy the bible is a book for everyone a recorded account of our christian faith and beliefs the scriptures are god breathed and suitable for teaching to all men and women if you have questions about the christian faith you can find the answers in the bible ive read it through many times i try to take time to read from it each day and study from the different books within the bible and so i have to the kjv bible in my bible readings i have several versions in two languages  the other finnish this time was a have fun guessing some of the words kind of an adventure i used my nabre bible for help in this  the explanations in the back dont apply to all found quite a few though im sure i missed some  if youre not intimately familiar with the king james bible and the works of shakespeare youre simply not literate in english such was the declaration of my bow tie wearing british accented english professor back in the s it sounded preposterously pretentious at the time but as the years passed and i became increasingly better read i began to see his point shakespeare and the king james bible both written in the same generation are absolutely ubiquitous in english literature endlessly mined for content titles and phraseology  though i had a pretty good working knowledge of both shakespeares works and the king james bible i had never read them completely through i read through shakespeares complete plays a couple years back which left reading through the king james bible genesis to revelation  reading the king james bible as literature as opposed to a spiritual guide is tremendously rewarding its language is majestic particularly in the psalms and the prophets the mythos so integral to the western tradition is rich with characters and stories that have inspired many great retellings it is replete with phrases and passages familiar from other literature when reading it specifically for its literary value it is impossible to miss how critical it is to our language and traditions  my old professor may have overstated his case but he was on the right track the king james bible is a central source of our language and literature reading this source of so much of our literary language and traditions is indeed a crucial step in an ongoing education in great english literature this is my fifth time reading through the bible ive found the more time i spend in gods word the closer i become to him and the more distant the world and its troubles become  the holy inerrant perfect word of god no book will ever measure up to it  enough said it seems to me like most families dont read the bible together like they did in the good old days that really is a shame the bible has so much to offer more than harry potter its great to teach our children about god but its also important to teach them how to draw closer to him on their own by reading the scriptures  i like this version because of its accuracy also the lds bible has a really good topical guide and bible dictionary that are very handy  im on the lookout for a really good childrens bible if anyone has any recommendations  march    yeah right twilight gets you votes i think not  but i have some data on how we die  from wiki on john von neumann honestly you must have heard of him hes just like the most important scientist ever practically  von neumann died a year and a half later in great pain while at walter reed hospital in washington dc he invited a roman catholic priest father anselm strittmatter osb to visit him for consultation a move which shocked some of von neumanns friends the priest then administered to him the last sacraments   i love the idea his friends were shocked doubtless they felt betrayed but maybe von neumann was merely being openminded trying the improbable when thats all thats left    my friend phil has a wife belinda she has a tshirt she made up which says on it  i shagged edward and he lived  if like me until a few months ago you have never heard of twilight let me explain in the story edward cant have sex with humans because it would kill them so okay this is funny right i hate printed tshirts but even im tempted by this one  just checking here if i mention twilight will i get more votes for my bible discussion  ive been thinking about the bible as a consequence of my fathers dying process during which he became closer to some of the ideas than he had been for some time  as one observes in various crises in ones life in general were willing to try anything when asked peter cook said he wanted to die like wc fields studying the bible looking for loopholes while not wishing to doubt there are atheists so strong in their beliefs that they die in a content way most people whatever they think they are when it comes right down to it will hope like hell so to speak that theres a heaven somewhere to go next  so in the style of sherlock holmes do we not having eliminated the impossible look to the improbable and the point of christian belief is that it is about the improbable but not the impossible have you never in your life out of sheer desperation prayed to the god that might after all be there listening to you or is it only excatholics that do this  i received a newsletter in the post when i came back from adelaide soon after my father had died it discussed him in some detail  as being alive strange to read  and inter alia said  i visited monica and paul on australia day their st wedding anniversary and took them some jubilee cake paul told me that he had been praying to mary mackillop for a miracle later that day i returned with fr rob egar who anointed paul i saw that as the miracle many of you will remember that monica and paul left the church very publicly about  years ago so ongoing prayers for them at this difficult time would be much appreciated   is that a bit of referring to mannys idea gametheory the nun seeing this as a miracle is it a bit of gametheory that my father is suddenly praying to saints and desiring blessings which i might add he is taking from all and sundry he asked his friend morris when he came to visit him if he had any good blessings in him morris modestly demurred  now my father was a highly intellectual and knowledgeable theologian a trait which stayed with him however publicly he left the church what i cant see him as at any point in his life is a christian i say that from the perspective of having been brought up for ten years or so in a family which was devout and yet and yet i think my father was doing what anybody would when faced with the options trying the bloody unlikely when thats all thats left best book in the world the only book that can bring you to christ and save your soul it is inspired by god each book each word please accept jesus hes the only way to god his father father god remember those who read these words and touch their hearts help them to draw near to you be merciful towards those who keep rejecting you over and over bring them to you precious father show them they need to accept your son jesus in jesus precious name i pray amen i have finished reading the whole bible in a year now to start again  nothing greater was ever written than the living word of god i couldnt survive without this book may i bind it about my neck and write its words in my heart that i might not sin against god i cant believe i finally finished ive been reading through since last year along with my seminary class last year i read the old testament and i finally finished the new testamentsimply knowing all of the bible stories is good but it strengthened my faith so much to really read through them and study them i feel like i know the savior and all of the ancient prophets a lot better now the king james version of the bible is composed of two parts the old testament and the new testament the old testament which was translated from the original hebrew and aramaic tells of the creation and gods dealings with man often through the voice of his prophets the story with man began at adams creation and once the human population grew it centered on those most righteous until the human race became so sinful that they were wiped out except for noah and his family that cataclysmic event known as the flood archeologists have found reference to in other ancient writings the story then continues on to the patriarch abraham whose descendants are promised to be as numerous as the sands of the sea the descendants who traced their genealogy back to abraham were for the most part the people who became known as the jews the old testament is the history of these people  there were two recurring themes that became apparent in the old testament for one thing man was warned over and over again about sin being repulsive to god and unlike today when it got bad enough the people were punished by plagues famine or foreign invasion until all those god deemed the most unrighteous were either killed off or made to repent of their sinful ways in time with the return of prosperity future generations often reverted back to the sinful ways of their fathers and the cycle was repeated with the deliverer being a moses or ester raised up by god for the occasion  the other recurring theme was the prophecies of a messiah that was to come to save and rule over abrahams descendants these prophets were not always recognized as the mouthpiece of god some were killed probably for pointing out the sins of the people there was a misconception concerning this messiah which was clarified in the new testament the messiah was to save everybody worthy and not just the literal descendants of abraham  the new testament translated mainly from greek and latin tells the story of the coming of this long awaited messiah known in christendom as jesus christ it starts with his miraculous birth as foretold by the old testament prophets and goes on to cover his ministry the miracles he performed and the gospel he taught which in its simplicity shows how one needs to act in order to be saved by being saved one hopes to return to that god which gave one life rather than spending eternity being tormented by demons in hell also covered and most importantly is the death and resurrection by jesus and here is where the jewish and christian teachings diverge the majority of the ruling jewish religious leaders of the time claimed that jesus was a false prophet and had the romans execute him by crucifixion the christians claim that jesus allowed himself to be killed to atone for the original sin of adam and eve and that after three days he rose from the dead  besides telling the story of jesus there are some books or chapters in the new testament which were actually letters written by apostles to members of the new church these offered encouragement warnings and guidance the last book by john is a prophecy of the last days and the second coming of christ  are there other prophets mentioned in the original hebrew not mentioned in the old testament of the bible for one reason or another my guess is probably is every story or poem from the original hebrew included no i do wonder though if there have been any jewish prophets such as isaiah since john the baptist who have spoken of the messiah yet to come this is a fundamental text of western civilization at a minimum we should all be familiar with genesis exodus judges kings and job of the socalled old testament and the first four books matthew mark luke and john of the new testament  they are critical to anyones understanding of western culture philosophy and literature
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)",in my experience readers either love adams books or quickly put them down i for example quite literally worship the words adams puts on the page and have read the hitchhikers trilogy so many times that i have large tracts of it memorized but both my wife and father couldnt get past book one the former because she found it too silly and the latter because he found the writing to be more about the authors personality than plot and character  whatever  the first three books in the hitchhikers trilogythe hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the restaurant at the end of the universe and life the universe and everythingare inspired lunacy the ideas plots puns jokes and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers but people from all fields for instance the babel fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that adams created in book one you can find dozens of recipes online for pangalactic gargle blasters the chess computer deep thought that lost two matches to gary kasparov in  was named after a computer in book one and seriously who hasnt heard that the answer to life the universe and everything is  for more of these consult wikipediaorgs entry on the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy cultural references chances are if youre reading these books for the first time youll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after adams creations  the books arent of course without their problems adams himself admitted that the trilogy had and i paraphrase a long beginning a long conclusion and not much in the middle though i cant remember where i read that he was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out oneliners the books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics  despite this the hitchhikers trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books ive ever reada position theyve occupied for some fifteen years adams wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly consistently make me howl with laughter the other being terry pratchett readers beware if the adams bug infects you you will have it for life and youll never be sorry you let it bite the universe is a joke  even before i was shown the meaning of life in a dream at  then promptly forgot it because i thought i smelled pancakes i knew this to be trueand yet i have always felt a need to search for the truth that nebulous illtreated creature adams has always been to me to be a welcome companion in that journey  between the search for meaning and the recognition that its all a joke in poor taste lies douglas adams and luckily for us he doesnt seem to mind if you lie there with him hes a tall guy but hell make room  for all his crazed unpredictability adams is a powerful rationalist his humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted it turns out it takes little more than a moments questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonable  it is no surprise that famed atheist richard dawkins found a friend and ally in adams what is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by adams quips and absurdities his approach is much more personable and less embittered than dawkins which is why i think of adams as a better face for rational materialism which is a polite was of saying atheism  reading his books its not hard to see that dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who cant even recognize when a point has actually been made adams humanism however stretched much further than the contention between those who believe and those who dont  we see it from his protagonists who are not elitist intellectualstheyre not even especially brightbut damn it theyre trying by showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be true  its all a joke its all ridiculous the absurdists might find this depressing but theyre just a bunch of narcissists anyhow demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis attractive people in bathing suits and eulers identity i say lets sit down at the bar with the rabbi the priest and the frog and try to get a song going or at least recognize that its okay to laugh at ourselves now and again its not the end of the world  its just is a joke but some of us are in on it another classic if you dont like this series you probably put your babel fish in the wrong hole you are the reason that human beings are only the third most intelligent species on earth behind mice and dolphins so long and thanks for all the fish absurdity at its finest  arthur dent is having a bad day his house is about to be levelled down because its in the way of the construction of a new freeway at the local pub he encounters his enigmatic friend ford prefect prefect a galactic hitchhiker is leaving the earth and taking dent with him a minor nuisance apparently the earth is just about to be demolished to make way for an interstellar freeway dents realization is instant several billions of people are going to have a very bad day  this is the most ridiculously funny book ive ever read although that may be because it was my very first of the kind i think the hype is very well deserved if you are into that kind of humor i lost track of how many times it made me laugh and im not really an easy person to make laugh outrageously silly scifi humor in every single chapter an unforgettable ride through an absurdity of worlds scattered along the vast craziness of an unfathomable galaxy  the movie  is a mediocre adaptation at best even with a stellar cast like rockwell deschanel and malkovich its not nearly as funny as the book not by a long shot at least for me it doesnt make it justice and is not exactly faithful to the original work and sadly you just cant bring down the magnificently complex absurdity of douglas writing to cinematic dialog without losing much of its original magic  a work that showed humanity its insignificance and that madness is a general entertaining trait in the universe  one of the greatest milestones of the rare scifi comedy hybrids although its losing quality after the first  parts fantasy seems to be more prone to comedy than scifi i dont know why thats the fact i would tend to call it kind of terry pratchett in space because of the unique wit just without the stamina for so many parts adams dying in a fitness center of a heart attack comes in here too although he already stopped continuing the series years before  more sheer fun than the rest of the serious its just hilarious and very clever using different comedy tropes in space not for science one of these ideas one has once in a lifetime in adams case mixed with talent its mostly constructed by  running gags some scifi elements and comedy characters thereby the wacky protagonists construct the laughs with slapstick some deeper stuff and general strangeness the underlying criticism level isnt very high in the first part which can mostly be seen as pure entertainment  so successful because its so easy to read there is better more ironic and more complex scifi out there but nothing as pleasant as adams work no need to think too hard or get depressed about human nature no info dump and worldbuilding overkills just characters puns and gags mixed with some dept and  the second and third part of the series include some of the best indirect social criticism too but it sadly doesnt improve after that ive read until the fifth one and adams just cant live up to the expectations anymore starts recycling his schemes and just isnt as compelling as in the original trilogy maybe he had already enough money wasnt really motivated or lost his muse but its quite a shame because there would have been potential as endless as space for more really good parts  useless fandom trivia the author as the story goes had the idea while watching the sky completely wasted some might say poisoned by gsser beer in my home country austria i dont believe this because stiegl beer is just much better than this bitter concoction whip me with a towel if you have a problem with that i can easily handle a little intergalactic spanking  im a firm believer that every budding reader ought to read this book first so they can be utterly and completely ruined for literature for the rest of their lives  of course if youre an older reader with experience and verve when it comes to words you might also be completely ruined for literature for the rest of your life too but im not counting you in fact i dont care about you  i have a towel  and i know how to use it its almost but not quite entirely unlike having a clue   fortunately i myself had been totally ruined for literature early on in my life and i think i might have read this book around seven or eight times before i got the idea that nothing else i would ever read would quite stack up to it and afterward i just decided to become marvin and assume that the whole world was not quite worth living  but again fortunately i remembered that i was an earthling and i could replace most of my cognitive centers with what and get along quite nicely so thats what i did and ever since ive been reading normal books and saying what quite happily  you see happy endings do happen as long as youre not a pot of petunias of course that story would take way too long to tell  i think i want to grab a bite to eat maybe i ought to meet the meat what can i say i wish i had been in the movie although it was bad and i guess i should be happy about not being in it review of the audio read by stephen fry  overall fry earns a solid b for his rendition of the classic hitchhikers guide fry has the perfect narrator voice and i generally enjoyed most of his character voices ford prefect often has a rakish tone his reading of arthur dent is noteperfect clueless and zaphod beeblebrox has a deliciously smarmy confidence it was a bit of a revelation to find marvin more amusing in audio than when i read the book although i feel like fry might have given him a tad too much despondent enthusiasm his reading of the vogon gibberish as the babel fish was inserted and translated it into english had me laughing  no my biggest problem is that i think sometimes fry got a little too involved in the story and his character voices bled together hed suddenly remember who was speaking and pull zaphod out of dashing ford territory and back into cocky confidence but it was often enough and in dialogue enough that i definitely noticed as a trend not an instance  well no matter still utterly engaging there was a distracting formatting issue where the pause between chapters must have been edited out between the end of the previous chapter fry reading the chapter heading ex chapter five and the continuation of the story there was no pause at all  though audible claims this is unabridged i either spaced out a few moments entirely possible or it isnt quite ill have to give it another listenthrough as im driving but im definitely enthusiastic about moving on to the restaurant at the end of the universe if fry is reading they stumbled out of the heart of gold and looked around them it was very quiet among the tall buildings the ground was covered with brightlycolored objects that from a distance looked a little like paperback novels trillian picked one up  its a paperback novel she said surprised long hard ride by lorelei james she flipped through it hm whod have thought that the late inhabitants of frogstar z would have been into womens erotica  she picked up some more be with me by maya banks dangerous secrets by lisa marie rice a little harmless pleasure by melissa schroeder theyre all womens erotica  really wonderful humor funny language absurd imagery and fantastic characters the most fun ive ever had with books and audiobooks i had this on tape the bbc version and would listen to this in my car or on my walkman repeatedly  if youve ever wondered where those references to the number  come from what it would be like to have two heads or what about the answer to life the universe and everything  look no further  actually im gonna head off right now to get the audiobook and pick up a ringtone  notification sound from that sorry got to go  yay  edit back from picking up the bbc audiobook ooohhh how wonderful sorry gotta go again walk the dog and listen to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy on my smartphone that walkman is soo history i have spent almost six hours in the delightful company of stephen fry reading the satirical science fiction classic with incredible skill and humour  as i had read it before i had to bow to frys ability to speak the strange evocative names of the characters without giving away his amusement more than with a tiny rise in the voice  the story starts with a bleak outlook on life on earth of course while arthur dent a regular human being is in a rage over a bulldozer which is about to tear down his house to make space for a bypass road a slightly bigger construction project in space causes an alien company to erase the whole planet earth for the same reason gone is our home just moments before the extraterrestrial company receives information to the effect that the demolition of earth is unnecessary  well it is not the first time unnecessary things have happened in the construction business and earth is not that important anyway from a universal standpoint as arthur realises while travelling with an alien journalist researching for a book called the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy after  years of studying earth he is able to expand the entry on our planet by adding a mostly to the previous oneword comment summing up our entire globe harmless arthur reflecting on the loss of trafalgar square and mcdonalds as the planet is destroyed has a moment of hardship accepting that all that is left of his previous home now is a redundant note on it being mostly harmless  thus thrown on an odyssey in space the pair makes acquaintances of diverse kinds always learning something new about how not to take life too seriously while still trying to understand it one fabulous scene features the travellers on a hostile space ship subject to the socalled vogons poetry appreciation chair where they are kept in place while inundated without mercy with the unbearably horrific vogon poetry the third worst in universe i imagine it a bit like being strapped to a chair and forced to listen to and appreciate some famous twitter that is produced on our mostly harmless explanet  when asked to choose whether they prefer to be thrown into space or to appreciate the value of what they have heard the two heroes deliver a duet of superb poetry appreciation bullshit bingo leaving the mean vogon wondering whether he might really have talent after all but being heartless and cruel he kicks them out of the spaceship anyway escaping certain death yet again with a seconds margin the hitchhikers are picked up by another ship in an act of major improbability which is accurately calculated for them  the most impressive character in the book is the supercomputer deep thought whose sulking voice is brilliantly interpreted by stephen fry he has a godlike attitude and is preparing for the arrival of the messiah of computers which will ultimately trump him even though it is to be designed by deep thought himself  while awaiting the time of the new supercomputer deep thought agrees to give the answer to life the universe and everything as the recipients of the answer are not happy with it not being able to understand what it means they set out to find the proper question to make sense of it deep thought himself cant do it and tells them they have to wait for the new messiah computer  however being inventive they try different questions that match the answer in the intermediate time acting very much like true philosophers  their first try is a bit too straightforward  what is six times seven  then they have a touch of genius and find the perfect interim question for the answer  how many roads must a man walk down  brilliant  the answer my friend is fortytwo the answer is fortytwo  all universe must have conspired to make them come up with that deep question for the hardtounderstand answer it could almost be a song if you changed the lyrics a bit or maybe the kind of horrible vogonian poetry that exacademies would award  while our characters are off to have lunch at the end of the universe deep thought is preparing for the arrival of his son the new supercomputer he has given him a name already  the earth  and the most intelligent creatures on the old demolished planet say  thank you for all the fish  delightfully irreverent journey through the nonsensical human existence i read this book about  times when i was in seventh grade i wore my copy out that was a time in my life when i very much would have preferred to belong to some alien species trapped here through no fault of my own also the ships hung in the air in much the same way that bricks dont how can you improve on writing like that i was quite afraid i wouldnt take to the book considering how many people close to me  as well as at parties  would rage rage rage at my never having read hitchhikers guide what would the fallout be would i be shanked at the next party i went to if when asked about my liking of the book i were to shrug oh the anxiety  but im happy to report i did like it  a lot too once the sperm whale and petunia chapter came up and then all the more when the old world builder or awardwinning fjord artist wandered in and then i felt as if i might come to possibly have a crush on the book after zaphod gave his monologue about how he thinks  the absurdity in the story and its world was of the specific kind i care about  an absurdity that manages to parallel this worlds absurdity but tinged with mystery whimsy and wonder of course its the kind of absurdity that exists in the stupendous doctor who which makes sense and exists somewhat in dead like me i dont find much purpose for the other kind of absurdity you know the kind that ragged empty cold fraught and menacing absurdity that lives in the batmans joker and performance art projects by people with bold asymmetrical hair cuts shudder  its all right ive found my way back  ill now take joy in reading chriss hefty and timeworn ultimate hitchhikers guide rather than approach it with the dread of potentially being shanked which is a good thing no its that time of the year again when i take out the towel i embroidered with  as well as dont panic and sit down to enjoy this classic and silly scifi story  the story is wellknown to most but let me recap real quick arthur dent is losing his house because of a bypass funnily enough he doesnt have to suffer the injustice for long because the planet earth is scheduled to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass as well his friend ford prefect turns out to be an alien who tells him all about interstellar hitchhiking thus begins an epic quirky adventure through the galaxy meeting aliens that use poetry as a form of torture and trying to get our home planet back  many say this book in a mess and in many ways it is but its a good mess the kind of mess life itself is humour is when you laugh no matter what douglas adams was great at showing the tragedy in life through humour making the characters here so lovable that i have no problem reading the story every year on the day he died far too soon aged only  of a heart attack  heres to you dna thanks for all the fish    yeah im reading it again  especially for towel day  xd  every year im reading the book for towel day now the third time by now and every year its as good as the very first time xd simply brilliant  i cant remember laughing at a book so much  loved loved loved everything about it  the delivery by stephen fry is outstanding also  hugely recommend there arent enough superlatives to throw at this the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is my favorite book of all time and most likely always will be ive read it more times than i can remember and it has made me laugh every single time lines like life dont talk to me about life space is big really big you wont believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is and time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so will never fail to make me smile and just typing those out did the trick i could sit here all day and talk about how great this book is and how brilliant douglas adams is  this book is ridiculous in the best possible way but the comedy isnt the only thing that makes it so great the plot is really interesting as well and it takes you on an incredible journey across the universe with some very memorable characters from arthur dent being completely overwhelmed by everything to zaphod beeblebroxs total absurdity to marvin the paranoid android just as a whole because hes amazing every single character is great in their own way  there is a reason that this book is so highly regarded among science fiction works because its a truly incredible work of art its one of the best books ive ever read and one that i would recommend to anyone so remember dont panic and always know where your towel is its true what they say you pick up the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and either chuck it away when your head starts to whirl or you totally appreciate the headwhirling sensation plunge right in and dont surface till you have reached the restaurant at the end of the universe  it is with great delight and spots before my eyes that i can proclaim that i belong to the latter breed you need a wee bit of whimsy a lot of quirky and a love for all things whacky all three which i possess in abundance to appreciate the magnificence of this space odyssey  the plot is fairly simple seconds before planet earth is completely demolished to make way for a galactic bypass bemused englishman arthur dent is whisked away to safety by his friend ford prefect ford is not an outofwork actor as he has led everyone to believe he is in fact the resident of a small planet in the vicinity of betelgeuse and a researcher for the revised edition of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy  together the burstingwithenthusiasm ford and the burstingwithdisbelief arthur get set to cruise around the galaxy adding to the comedy of errors are zaphod beeblebrox the twoheaded threearmed galactican president trillian a lady who by some bizarre coincidence had once given arthur the ditch at an earthparty and marvin the oppressivelydepressed robot who could drive even a spaceship to suicide  along the way they have many a hitandfly situation with various warped creatures who inhabit the universethey listen to some truly terrible poetrythey land on the legendary planet magratheaand even learn about the superintelligent computer deep thought and its mission to answer the question to life the universe and everything all this while trying to find a decent cup of tea  douglas adams was the king of oneliners and whipsmart dialogue he took human flaws failings and reams of redtape and converted it into a seriously funny tale many argue that the written work is just a reflection of adamsthoughtswell hellwhich book isnt  i have hemmed and hawed over the years wondering whether i should pick up the book or notalways inhaling it in bits and pieces all i can say to the stillwary is this grab the spaceship by its taillights and get geared for a madtrip of a lifetime this book and its sequel the restaurant at the end of the universe are ultimately a story about how ludicrous we tiny little creatures actually are how we fill our lives with bullshit trivialities that are nobody elses business with institutions and bureaucracies and how the pattern repeats in micro and macro scale how ultimately people really are very silly that we search for meaning in an existence where there probably is none beyond being you know nice to each other that were always looking for the willbe and never savoring the now how everyone needs to just fucking take it easy  but most importantly this book is funny laugh out loud funny and it probably contains the greatest narrative device ive ever read to pass exposition along to the reader shall we have paragraphs of info dump shall we have long and tedious conversations amongst each other to explain to the reader whats going on no lets build ourselves a nb named arthur and hand him a tiny electronic book that will not only explain everything the reader needs to know but make them giggle like five years olds to boot  mr adams sir you are missed i dont know how many times ive read this masterpiece of perfectly logical nonsense but there is a reason i try to read it every year for towel day th may this year ive decided to finally read the entire trilogy which is also why i started a bit early  today must be a thursday funny that it actually is because arthur dent has never gotten the hang of those as it were this particular day was when a demolition crew came to demolish his house to make way for a bypass shortly after planet earth follows its example for a hyperspace bypass but not to worry arthur survives thanks to his friend ford prefect whos actually an alien they end up hitchhiking through the galaxy with a copy of the titular book some babel fish and  of course  at least one towel after all there is more to the blue marble than meats the eye and it has to do with the answer to the question of life the universe and everything  along the way we get overenthusiastic spaceship computers a depressed robot a galactic president that would make the current one in the white house look perfectly ordinary some mice and an awardwinning engineer  this is one of those books that you either love or hate not least because humour is a fickle thing douglas adams managed to perfectly capture the silliness ridiculousness and nonsense behind human existence bureaucracy and the many questions we tend to philosophize about and wrapped them all up in a space adventure he managed to put his finger exactly on the stupid stuff and emphasized the things we probably should pay more attention to such as gorgeous fjords  as light and funny as this book seems on the surface it is a deeper analysis of all of us an attempt at making sense of a couple of things while not taking anything too seriously because lifes too short for that the author sadly proved that  definitely a classic that deserves all the different adaptations it actually started out as a radio drama and was only turned into a novel later looking forward to finally finding out how the journey continues this was my first exposure to the writing of doug adams i went on to read the full hitchhiker series with great enjoyment the perfect tongue in cheek humor and a plot that pulls you along combination wow i cannot articulate just how much i loved this book  ford youre turning into a penguin stop it  the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is my first douglas adams novel and it is going directly to my favorites shelf the humor is wonderfully dry and the writing oh so clever this is the kind of novel that will stick with me forever the kind that i will read over and over  i cant wait to jump into the restaurant at the end of the universe  so long and thanks for all the fish the world has gone mad no the entire universe has and by reading this we get to laugh about it the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a little bit of a mad ride but what a joyous one    arthur dent a regular averagely intelligent guy from earth one day finds himself entangled in a very improbable chain of events that lead him to finding out that his best friend is an alien everything goes downhill from there there is no point in summarizing the story as its not the story that makes this book special  for a moment nothing happened then after a second or so nothing continued to happen  its how the story is made up everything is reversed and the narrative takes the most surprising and unexpected twists and turns always resulting in something humorous its more than a space opera however because in its absurdity it manages to be highly relevant even over three decades after its publication    its puts us into our place humans have this tendency to think of themselves as the most developed species but little did we know that the universe is in fact run by mice and the aliens in this book are all just as clueless about where they belong and what kind of world they live in which is comforting because isnt this was life is essentially like confusing sometimes seemingly pointless  the hitchhikers guide is a kind reminder that thats okay that it is enough to remember that were just part of something that is so much bigger than the perspective we have on it and while we never will fully understand what is happening around us we might as well just try gathering as much knowledge as we can in order to find our way in a world that is full of chance and coincidence i cant think of any other sf book which is this incredibly funny in that droll british way that americans can never emulate in th grade i first read the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and three of its sequels but its this book that stays most in memory ive always wanted to revisit douglas adams story even though i was a bit worried it might not be quite as brilliant as i remembered but i can report that the audiobook narrated by english comedian and actor stephen fry is the perfect comic voice to capture the spirit of the book since the audiobook clocks in at just under six hours i decided it would be a good companion for a day hike in the mountains an hour from tokyo hopefully none of the other hikers were disturbed by the strange tall gaijin chuckling to himself on the trail  the story as most of us know though perhaps some younger readers wont begins with everyman arthur dent waking up one morning to discover a huge yellow bulldozer parked on his lawn preparing to demolish his house to make way for a bypass the local bureaucrat mr prosser explains that the plans were on display at the local government office but down in the basement with the lights and stairs missing in a locked filing cabinet in a bathroom with a sign on the door saying beware of the leopard  arthur dents best friend is ford prefect who turns out to be a galaxyhopping humanoid alien who has been stranded on earth for the last  years ford takes arthur to the local pub and informs him that the earth is about to be destroyed in a few minutes because it is scheduled for demolition to make way for a galactic bypass through local space and of course this information has been posted for years in the local planning office in alpha centauri ford is a researcher for the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy an electronic book that compiles the wisdom of the galaxy and is actually more popular than the encyclopedia galactica think of it as an early conceptual version of wikipedia  ford manages to get arthur and himself picked up on a passing spaceship but it turns out the ship is piloted by vogons perhaps the most vile obnoxious and charmless race in the galaxy worse yet they have a perverse love of poetry which is so dreadful that listeners need to be strapped down to prevent selfinjury  the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy also involves zaphod beeblebrox the galactic president his female companion trillian marvin the paranoid robot perhaps the greatest creation in all sf the deep thought supercomputer and finally the answer to life the universe and everything not what you might expect there isnt much point in describing further details of the book which actually started as a bbc radio

ravenous bugblatter beast of traal the heart of gold starship powered by the infinite improbability drive etc  the book is so fun and creative that i think it would appeal to readers of any age or

Hamlet,oh how much ink has spilled on this excellent shakespeare work and how many tears will have shedding for it i dare not imagine also i will not pretend to do a review that you would not have read probably dozens of times or even bring new elements you would not already know but only know this piece admittedly this is a tragedy therefore as the name suggests nothing very encouraging but what poetry in these verses what beauty in this bittersweet madness the prince of denmark believes he has reached the young hamlet is he mad i dont think so he saw a specter that of his father murdered by his uncle but who never felt the presence by his side of a loved one who had recently disappeared and what is more in more than questionable conditions i cannot say that i have never experienced this feeling or at least wanted to believe it the specter therefore reveals to his son how his brother did it to assassinate him and demand revenge so hamlets mind is tortured it is true but who wouldnt be after such a revelation so what does he have to do take the sword and spill the blood again for his part the king claudius sensing the danger does everything to remove hamlet from the kingdom of denmark to preserve his place on the throne hamlet therefore finds himself alone in the face of his fate because although the presence of this specter at the castle has been revealed to him by three guards and by his friend horatio on whom else he can count who will believe it he will take for mad which will well arrange the affairs of his uncle or others who would be just as greedy for power as he and who have dedicated their cause to claudius because as everyone knows the prime minister to name nothing but him must be faithful to the one he serves and devote his most remarkable devotion to him i will not say more about the plot because i think once again that i will only repeat what has already been said many and many times but i insist on the point that this work although this is a drama in which a lot of blood will flow is a thing of beauty to read and reread without fail the first time i read this book i was in highschool it was an page book the story was so short and simple so i wondered why so many people say this is such a complex playbook a couple of years later i bought a special edition of  pages too much no why not because the play was written in shakespearean english and every single word that was not in standard english was explained at the bottom of the page it explained the context the uses you can have from that word ok so i read that version and it was a pain in the ass not because it was a bad story at all but now i truly understand people who say that shakespeare was such a special writer and i agree well about the story fascinating i loved how shakespeare made of hamlet such a special character it was very difficult for hamlet to take action it was like almost almost i feel shakespeare wanted to express himself on hamlet his multiple personalities during the play reminded me of shakespeares life a bit on the other hand i really loved how this play ends what a bloody and violent ending terrific recommended absolutely but a simple version because the original might be too difficult and slow to read revenge and madness is what takes the theme throughout hamlet is eager to take revenge from his uncle who killed his father  king of denmark and mother who married his uncle later on  yet in his revenge he himself dies along with many others madness in great ones must not go unwatched or else it leads to turmoil and failure that was dramatic and wonderful  this was my first time picking up anything written by shakespeare and i now cant wait to continue exploring his works i had no idea which play to read first but most people recommended hamlet as a great place to start they were right  it felt like a perfect introduction  at its base hamlet is about a young king who wants to avenge his fathers death what i loved though was how it essentially went past its own plot and turned into one tremendous dramatic mess the plot is like a zigzag im still dizzy from reading the ending  we know what we are but not what we may be  i thought hamlet was an incredibly annoying character luckily we have horatio to turn to when his speeches start to sound too deranged horatio seemed to be the only character capable of being anywhere near calm and collected  the reason behind my threestar rating is the lack of emotional connection i had with the play it didnt get any sort of emotional response out of me except for a few smiles at hamlets sass other than that hamlet was well worth the read and id recommend it to anyone that wants to dip their toe into shakespeares work or their whole foot like me the writing is insane and theres never a dull moment because of it forever amused at the fact that  of the characters in this play all drop dead like flies there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so it was pretty good and depressing but definitely not my favourite shakespeare play  i will say tho  the project we did where we had to voice act out a soliloquy was so fun  i love being dramatic hamlet is one of those books people can analyze discuss and philosophize about on an intellectual level like a lot of literature it possesses great merit its much more enriching than the oh that bstard killed my father i will now seek my revenge plot line as it picks apart the psychological aspects of several characters and uses them to further the story several themes run their course and motifs abound overall without delving too deeply into it its a great book to write an ap lit essay or a literary analysis paper on  my threestar rating stems solely from my lack of emotional connection to the characters and the story i appreciated the nuances and the beauty of shakespeares writing but nothing made me care enough to experience any sort of literary enlightenment this shows how subjective my ratings are because i would recommend this for almost anyone even those who did not like romeo and juliet or macbeth  one of shakespeares most impressive qualities is the variation within his work by all means give this one a shot i have loved hamlet for most of my life ive read it performed in it read it again and again seen it on stage countless times performed in stoppards  minute version read it again and again and again and taught it over and over i have always loved it  but not this time  i finished rereading it last night ive one more class to teach tomorrow and i feel like ive just fallen out of love you know that feeling when you still love someone but youre no longer in love thats where i seem to be with the dane  i struggled all night trying to locate these new feelings where did they come from i wondered and i think i found the answer while i was eating my breakfast bagel im tired of hamlet and his internal world  i know there is much more to hamlet than this internal struggle  which the romantics gave us in the s and psychoanalysts entrenched in the s  but i cant seem to shake myself out of hamlets selfabsorption its like standing in front of picassos guernica and being so entranced by the suffering that picassos technique and political message disappear  i am always reading hamlet criticism i listen to what others have to say including my often insightful students and i even discover new things for myself that ive never noticed before i hear these voices but none of them can break through my emotional attachment to hamlets selfexamination and i am bored with it i see the other stuff going on around it i hear the other things going on around it but i am as fixated on hamlets internal struggle as he is  and to make matters worse i am starting to wonder if the two hundred year preoccupation with hamlets internal world has reached the end of its usefulness is selfawareness useful in our time of reality shows and vampire love affairs is it as precious as the novel push by sapphire is it as dusty and mouldy as woody allen and philip roth do we need to find our way back to the roots of hamlet what is this quintessence of dust where man and dust are the key components or do we simply need to find something in hamlet that speaks to us in the here and now  or is the question really only one i can ask myself do i need to find something new in hamlet that speaks to me something to break my obsessive focus on whats going on inside  yeah its probably that ok i didnt finish act  or act  but i did watch the movie version  the one time i can say the book is better than the movie because what the heck is going on in this play i wrote an essay about iiii soliloquy and that was nice but hammy boy is just a depressed grad school student who has been rejected by too many girls and is now an incel tell me im wrong  anyways while i was procrastinating writing my essay i made a whole playlist so uhhh im contributing to society right after reading half of the play in english and failing to fully understand what it had been written i switched to a pdf of the play that was translated in greek i know this may sound weird but even then i couldnt fully understand what the characters were saying  my only solace is that this is a play and plays dont always work well as books  ps to everyone who has read the calla edition can we please take a moment to appreciate the amazing incredible beautiful illustrations throughout the book confused feelings loved reading this and still struggled to pick it up among other books got more and more difficult once the shakespearean momentum was broken took almost two months for it am i picking another shakespeare yes for sure but not in near future would be fun if read loudly in a group at the beginning of the play a ghost appears to marcellus barnardo and horatio horatio yells for the ghost to speak but the ghost leaves before it says anything the men think the ghost looks a lot like the dead king of denmark the ghost has appeared at least two times before the men on guard decide to tell hamlet about this occurrence worrying that they might sound senile in another place polonius says goodbye to his son laertes who is leaving for france laertes warns his sister ophelia to stay away from hamlet and overthinks the attention of hamlet towards her hamlets uncle claudius married hamlets very recentlywidowed mother which made him become the new king of denmark hamlet continues to mourn his fathers death and hates his mothers lack of loyalty when hamlet hears of the ghost from horatio he wants to see it for himself  finally the ghost shows himself to hamlet and reveals to him that he is his father he tells hamlet of the betrayal of his brother claudius claudius murdered hamlets dad to become the new king of denmark this makes hamlet very mad and he swears vengeance for his father but first he decides to act like he has gone mad while he tests the truth of the ghosts allegations  while acting mad he rejected ophelia while claudius and polonius spied on him they had hoped to find the reason for hamlets sudden change in behavior but couldnt claudius asked for guildenstern and rosencrantz some old friends of hamlet help find out whats got into him hamlet writes a play that includes scenes that mimic the murder of hamlets father during rehearsal hamlet and the actors get ready to present hamlets play before the king and queen  during the performance hamlet is closely watching claudius for his reaction so that he can truly understand and know what happened between his dad and claudius the play angers claudius and he stops the play by storming out he decides it is best to send hamlet away since he feels that he is on to him gertrude is not pleased by the play so she sends for him while on the way hamlet comes across claudius trying to pray he wants to kill him but he decides to wait for now in gertrudes room polonius is there in an attempt to protect her from her unpredictable son hamlet arrives ready for a fight with his mother but before he can he hears a noise coming from the spot where polonius is hiding he swiftly kills him making him one of the first to die in the climax  skipping ahead a bit hamlet goes to the graveyard to talk with horatio this is where ophelias funeral procession arrives hamlet ends up confronting laertes this leads to a duel between the two men claudius plans with laertes to kill hamlet they plan to either kill hamlet with a poisoned blade or with poisoned wine the plans dont go so well when gertrude drinks from the poisoned cup and dies then both laertes and hamlet are wounded by the poisoned blade and laertes dies every main character in the story that you can think of dies except for horatio he is left to spread the truth about what happened that day i read this for an english class im taking online so im not going to write a full review classics have always been pretty hit or miss for me  theres some that ive loved some that i just dont care for and others i truly hated i believe this one best fits into the third category but perhaps its just not what im in the mood for right now im mostly looking for escapist reads and hamlets not really the most fitting choice for that i have read shakespeare before im a sucker for twelfth night so this definitely got me interested in reading more in the future shakespeare is always relatively difficult to read and hamlet was no exception  the story at times was quite hard to follow but it was gripping which meant it was an easy read the themes and characters were interesting and it made me want to carry on reading and see how it all progressed and developed  despite it being a challenging read at times overall i found it rather enjoyable a great tragedy a boring ghost story i guess its both but i see it more as the latter how can one criticize the most famous writer in the world check with tolstoy he did it thoroughly and quite well  volumes of the complete works of ws have accumulated more specks of dust than there are grains of sand on this planet next time youre on the beach or in a cafe see if you can find anyone reading the bard as you can see its been like threefour weeks since i started a new semester at the university and i am already filling up on classics  i liked hamlet much more than i expected ill probably read more from shakespeare soon if this werent written in old english i probably would have enjoyed it tbh the plot is interesting and hamlet makes a good character anybody may blame me who likes but having grown to maturity under circumstances of mistreatment and neglect i have long learned to take action on my own behalf in protection of my heart my soul and indeed my life  having opened the prince of denmarks letter and ascertained his nefarious plans i hatched a plot of my own i took into my confidence his unwitting confederates reading that they his friends since childhood were also intended victims we joined forces in selfdefence under pretence of taking their leave they overpowered him and brought him bound on our voyage to england once there he was secreted to the home of my beloved edward rochester agreeing that hamlets actions were the product of a diseased brain together edward and i secured him in an attic room much as edward had confined his first wife also afflicted with madness the inestimable messrs rosencrantz and guildenstern are now in our employ guarding the attic performing that same office lately held by grace poole the other servants are inured to odd sounds emanating from the attic having long experience and generous payment to feign deafness  hamlets whereabouts will never be discovered and it may eventually be assumed he took his own life following the unfortunate ophelia to a watery death  a short and quick audiobook  hamlet is just one of my many tbr books luckily for me ive been on this weird kick to actually read the books that are my endless tbr list im hoping to lower the  books but so many books keep coming out so its hard and will be a longslow process for me  that being said i found the audiobook of this and just had to dive into it weirdly enough i never read this beforehand not even in my english classes growing up also it was kind of a two birds one stone situation because it ended up working for a challenge that im in double yay  this play had a vast cast of characters they were super likable and it made the audiobook a bit more fun to listen to everything i feel like i flew through this and enjoyed all the drama within this little play not going to lie i probably wouldve felt different reading it instead but im glad i got the chance to listen to it i definitely recommend the audio guys i have been postponing writing a review of this book for a long time because i didnt want to come short in portraying this book as big as it is  unfortunately i dont trust myself to remember everything correctly so i will just say that i really enjoyed it and it has become one of my favorite classics  i also really enjoyed the edition i read because every hard word even partially so was translated at the footnote of every page which helped me in understanding everything thats going on the complexity of the old text was one of the reasons i was always adamant that im never going to read shakespear but now i can enjoy his masterpieces and not worry about the vocabulary at all this is the first shakespeare play i have ever read in its entirety from beginning to end im very impressed with myself also it was very good even though everyone dies  stars question who decided that shakespearean plays were supposed to be read dully out loud in an english classroom who decided that students have to tear apart the words he writes to prep for essays on it who says he imagined his plays to be some sort of literary work of genius rather than good ole th century entertainment  this is a play and i think all plays regardless of when theyre written are meant to be watched sure there was plenty to analyze in hamlet but we should have just watched scenes and then looked at the text after  when i watched benedict cumberbatch deliver the oh what a rogue and peasant slave am i soliloquy on youtube i was literally so intrigued and could envision hamlets emotions so much more clearly like what is the point of having a teacher read this play out loud when these onstage versions exist and paapa essiedu playing hamlet was gold  this is a good play i just wish i had encountered it in a context where it didnt have to be twisted and compressed onto an ap flashcard to prep for this irrelevant national exam ah yes this little play hamlet is shakespeares longest play with most productions hitting the four hour mark im sure you all know the plot but here it is anyway hamlet meets the ghost of his father who tells him that his uncle killed him in order to usurp the throne and marry his wife hamlet spends the whole play complaining about it the end hamlet is not only regarded as shakespeares greatest play but also one of the greatest plays of all time meh its good the problem with hamlet is that its about hamlet aka the most annoying character in all of english literature i spent the majority of this play sighing whenever i read enter hamlet or when i saw he had another navelgazing soliloquy coming up  im genuinely incredibly curious as to why this is considered shakespeares greatest play to me it was just another average one for shakespeare hamlet is really a play for the minor characters rosencrantz and guildenstern steal every one of their scenes the same can be said for ophelia the ghost and even fucking yorick i did overall enjoy hamlet its one of shakespeares best constructed plays there arent any of the filler scenes that really permeated a lot of the early plays and i found it to be one of the easier plays to read however the s equivalent of holden caulfield takes some getting used to i feel like an heretic saying this for since the first time i read this play i didnt like hamlet much and after this reread its still true its the story that fails to enthrall me not so the characters not the prose not the stagecraft either ive suddenly remembered for like the th time that i vastly prefer watching plays to reading them of all the plays shakespeare has authored in his storied career hamlet is arguably his most famous and wellreceived work i am probably in the minority when i say that i found hamlet to be average while i agree that this play has several great moments lines and themes i must also say that there are just as many questionable components and lackluster scenes that bog down the entirety of the play  right off the bat i was under the impression that hamlet was a revenge tragedy meaning a play that revolved around a characters pursuit of revenge and their ultimate downfall because of it revenge tragedies are supposed to convey the message that revenge does more harm than good to someones cause resulting in more suffering than consolation by the end of it all that all sounds good for a shakespearean tragedy but the only problem is that hamlet is not truly a revenge tragedy at least not a successful one in my estimation though the theme of revenge is prevalent and advances the plot of the play i felt that it fell by the wayside as the play progressed being left in the dust in favor of other frankly more interesting themes the reason i am complaining about the execution of the revenge tragedy aspect of hamlet is because it is evident that shakespeare meant for it to be a major focus of his work that is he implements several supplementary components into the play in order to bolster the revenge story of hamlet yet they all fall flat and miss the mark for example hamlets pursuit of revenge against his uncle claudius is paralleled by two other characters in the play fortinbras and laertes who each seek their own revenge later in the plot we see that each characters revenge plays out differently based on how they approach their turmoil obviously in an attempt to demonstrate to the audience that there are right ways to resolve deepseated issues as well as wrong ways had the play been more about revenge and retained that focus throughout the play then this duality of revenge would have propelled hamlet into one of the absolute greatest and most complex works by shakespeare im certain as it stands however these efforts were for naught ultimately suffering due to the plays inability to explore hamlets revenge to its fullest extent often getting muddled along the way by too many detours in the plot  when i read hamlet as a revenge tragedy i did not have a very good time nothing seemed to make sense reading it through that lens for the revenge turned out to be such a minor aspect of the play though it claims to be the focal point but once i started reading the play as a character study on hamlet i began to see the value and brilliance of the work more than anything else hamlet is a play about the struggles people have within themselves when it comes to making tough choices hamlet deals with an innerconflict throughout most of the play after he learns of his fathers murder at the hands of his uncle and this is where the meat of the play dwells in his famous and very wellcrafted soliloquy hamlet contemplates to be or not to be for he is at a crossroads in his life what is he to do should he kill claudius and avenge his father possibly at the expense of his peace in the afterlife would he be better off letting his uncle live and forgetting about the whole matter even if it betrays his fathers vengeful request what about his own life is suicide a viable option to relieve himself of this massive responsibility or is it better to continue living and by proxy continue wallowing in such an intense form of suffering  as a result of these conflicting thoughts and difficult choices hamlet ends up being quite relatable to the regular person i think people have become accustomed to the concept of the ideal protagonist in fiction as in a character that is somehow better than the average person or lives for a greater purpose if you view hamlet through this lens you will miss the point of his character for he is not to be looked upon as a special character by any means rather he is like any one of us complete with the same emotions and characteristics fickle indecisive confused troubled and at constant odds with himself his plight of character is the very reason why he never takes a decisive stance either way he never commits to the revenge nor does he decide to let bygones be bygones instead his relatably human flaw his indecision prevents him from doing anything and that is ultimately the reason for his downfall this is a problem that many people have experienced in some arena of life when we cannot decide between several difficult choices regarding a difficult situation if you were annoyed at hamlets inaction for all of the play take a closer look at who he is hamlet is a regular guy who has been thrust into a situation that nobody could be expected to handle with poise and wisdom at least not under his specific circumstances after all what would you do in hamlets place probably something similar to what he did which makes him a realisitc and sympathetic character in my eyes  although hamlets role in the play was handled very well as it related to his inner struggles i will not defend his personality in fact i found hamlet to be annoying and absolutely dumbfounding at times i can understand the troubles he has to deal with in terms of his fathers murder and the subsequent revenge over which he debates but why is he such an unlikeable person on top of it all hamlet for all of his indecisiveness and inaction concerning his revenge sure is quick to attack everyone in the play except the one person that actually deserves his wrath basically hamlet never really confronts claudius in any meaningful capacity but he goes after the girl he loved ophelia and his mother gertrude particularly hard he takes out all of his rage and anger on these two characters when they really did not have anything to do with his fathers murder basically hamlet is just an inexcusable asshole even if he is going through some undoubtedly tough times  additionally hamlets brilliant idea to feign madness to mislead his uncle does not serve his ends well actually it is the reason why claudius decides to get rid of hamlet early on in the play before he even finds out that hamlet knows about his treacherous indiscretions what does acting crazy in front of everyone do to help hamlets situation i fell like hamlet was two separate characters that switched places every so often  alternating between the wellwritten and profound hamlet i outlined earlier and the hamlet that contradicted these qualities and behaved so irrationally at other moments all i have to say is when hamlet is treated seriously as a character he excels as a tragic figure but when he is depicted as a cynical fool he ruins the play and demeans the progression of his character arc much to the detriment of the play as a whole  even though i came to the conclusion that hamlet is just an average play i will say that i was fully immersed in the plot the entire time befitting to shakespeare the writing style was poetic and complex and made the play exciting to read the whole way through even during the weaker parts i just wish that such good writing did not have to be wasted on what amounted to be a middleoftheroad play in conclusion i think hamlet was overrated but still worth reading for the components that are actually dealt with properly and effectively if you can overlook its faults and focus mainly on its strengths then hamlet should not be too troubling a read just dont expect to get the greatest play of alltime out of it that way hamlet shouldnt be too disappointing i had read it in school but to be honest didnt remember much of it so i decided to read it again  stars i put because first of all i dont like that much tragedies but even if it is sad ending this one is kind of useless what i mean everyone dies and all the grudges are so useless taking hamlet himself i find his personality very week even this famous to be or not to be than when his dead father appears to him and asking for revenge dead are already dead you cant change anything about it and good that we cant see them otherwise it would be complete nonsense continue their life or seeking for revenge the second point his love to ophelia he loves her than he dont a lot of places were pretty interesting l but a lot  very stupid but maybe that was a point at the end  i understand why it is so popular
"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",i dont want to talk to anyone dont even look at me i was expecting it and i still cried for like  minutes  should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once they may have been put under the imperius curse  time for interesting little subplots is over weve arrived finally where everything is closely tied to the core of the story and progressing fast its always delightful to see everything that was great about the series still remains the same if not better however disappointments sorrow and hardships are what the reader is going to encounter for the most part as i finished reading halfblood prince more than ever before i feel being trapped in a hopeless situation filled with nothing but forebodings  destinationdeterminationdeliberation  one would imagine were beyond being accommodated with new characters but the author will quickly convince you otherwise and introduction of new and interesting characters continues its great to see how rowling keeps outperforming herself with each new book  harrys illtempered nature and suspicions does not end with the last book as i hoped it would but the results are quite the opposite this time around honestly i did not anticipate the way how things turned out right till the last three chapters  to friendship to generosity to ten galleons a hair  weve been somewhat used to happy ending in the first four books relatively with th being a bit disappointing but this one it was the most depressing ending for me yet it probably comes down to reinforcing the suspense toward the final book but its a difficult place to be in  especially if you had to wait for a year  eet as been too long im not sure why but this one took me completely by surprise i was expecting this installment to be mainly filler to get us to the deathly hallows but so much happened here that i must have forgotten from the movie the halfblood prince was considerably darker than the previous  books and i just adore how this series has progressed and grown just like most of its readers have obviously i knew what the big reveal was prior to finishing the book due to my viewing the films before but it didnt take away from the experience the novel had to offer i have this nervous lump in my throat knowing that the next book is the final one but am simultaneously excited to finally read what the films surely have left out surrounding the conclusion of the series harry potter and the halfblood prince harry potter  jk rowling  harry potter and the halfblood prince is a fantasy novel written by british author j k rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the harry potter series  set during protagonist harry potters sixth year at hogwarts the novel explores the past of harrys nemesis lord voldemort and harrys preparations for the final battle against voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor albus dumbledore  the book was published in the united kingdom by bloomsbury and in the united states by scholastic on  july  as well as in several other countries  lord voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and muggle worlds with his death eaters kidnapping wandmaker garrick ollivander from diagon alley and destroying the millennium bridge  the malfoy family is disgraced when lucius is apprehended and sent to azkaban for his involvement with the death eaters  voldemort instead chooses draco to carry out a secret mission at hogwarts dracos mother narcissa and aunt bellatrix lestrange seek help from severus snape who claims to have been acting as a mole within the order of the phoenix all along  snape makes an unbreakable vow with narcissa to protect draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails  harry potter now  years old accompanies albus dumbledore from surbiton to the village of budleigh babberton to visit former potions professor horace slughorn slughorn who has been in hiding agrees to return to teach at hogwarts  dumbledore then takes harry to the burrow where harry reunites with his best friends ron weasley and hermione granger  the three visit fred and george weasleys new joke shop at diagon alley and see draco entering knockturn alley with a group of death eaters including fenrir greyback  harry believes voldemort has made draco a death eater but ron and hermione are sceptical on the hogwarts express harry hides in the slytherin carriage using his invisibility cloak but is spotted and petrified by malfoy i was first introduced to harry potter in a childrens lit class in college i had resisted this popular phenomenon until i was forced to pick it up for a grade and book  was short enough that i could read it in the course of  hours i have to admit i wasnt impressed to any extent nor did i dislike the experience but i was critical on grounds of its being derivative even if reading the first led to reading the second after all if i was bored and looking for something light i could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends but it was really the third book with its increasing darkness that took me in and made me a fan  with a movie coming out for order of phoenix and deathly hallows on the horizon i decided i would reread halfblood prince i figured it would take four sittings of course with its  pages but time does fly when reading this one and ive come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far what i wouldnt have been willing to admit in college that im perfectly comfortable saying now is that jk rowling is a fantastic storyteller she writes with great clarity wit and humor and shes created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people due to the common experience of growing up can relate closely  that said the reason for my preference for the th book is that its the most emotionally rich in the series here we get the backstory of voldemort spoiler alert through a series of flashbacks coming in hp by way of magically extracted memories and in this way we come to understand the villains similarities and differences with our hero after all the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts and until now we dont know what these are  voldemort is from a oncepowerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town wary of outsiders and their main point of pride is their pure blood the lineage having crossbred for generations so as not to pollute the line voldemorts mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man muggle in this world and when her father and brother are arrested she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off she ends up pregnant the man deserts her and she dies while giving birth to her halfwizard halfmuggle son thus making him an orphan like harry  faulkner anyone  but whereas harry comes to hogwarts and befriends ron and hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions voldemort when growing in the orphanage shuns other children torturing them at times without the awareness of adults and stealing their possessions what fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings his mothers weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch and the muggle blood inherited from his father over the course of his time at hogwarts voldemort charming as only evil can be learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes but he never befriends anyone he moves through his hatred further away from many of the emotions that drive harry namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents death  with dumbledores help in exploring voldemorts past harry begins to understand that hes come to be where he is through the choices hes made that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy a fact thats made all the more poignant when dumbledore in an allout assault on hogwarts by voldemorts death eaters is killed at the end the stakes are higher than before the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near and things are looking darker than ever which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question how will our hero prevail it seems like by now everyone would realize they should listen to harry such a sad end  i knew that was going to happen before starting the series but didnt know when it still got me in the feels though the book as a whole was really fun and entertaining i love the mystery and learning more about voldemort the romance drama was funny as well i cant wait to see what adventures the next book brings and how it all concludes do you know what is better than this book this book being already amazing this book narrated by stephen fry i swear this was my second attempt ever to listen to an audiobook and the narration was so good i actually enjoyed it so much and i hate listening to audiobooks i have read this book many times although the penultimate one was years ago lets say that this was the first time ive read them in ebook form  the reading was marvellous there were things id forgotten eg how late harry and ginny got together id also forgotten about most of the funeral ill say no more spoilers oblige  what this book tells me is that sadly the more conservative of readers grammarians etc will place so many books above harry potter  none of which is worth mentioning in the same breath as potter lore  to me this series is special nobody else will undertake waiting for each book to come out and lay our hands on them the potter universe will belong to our descendants forever but it was we who helped create this fervor and unmatched popularity for a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food i was banned to cook i eventually burn them when i defreeze them i was born with nonculinary skills i repeated what joey tribbianni did because after finishing this book i cried so hard i cursed nonstop i screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and i tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but i changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop so instead of throwing away or burning the pages which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and its one of the best ones of the seriesfreezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices ive had  as my new weekend quarantine habit i started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before at least this time i prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers theyre so precious things and i hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if theyre historical artifacts and i bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart  this is sweet  adventures of harry the girl crushes secret smiles hormonal and characteristic changes seeing the world from different aspect if i didnt get so sad with the unexpected ending this might be second favorite hp book because jkr wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives  i never get bored to reread any hp books or anything jkr writes instead of shopping list lately they made me sleep so i had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize i will find myself reading these books a decade later and i will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time thats the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent this brought my right back to my year old self who was cooped up in bed shedding tears for the first time over a book because of the ending i remember how i lay in bed i remember the sun shining through the blinds and how wounded i felt that we lost one of the greats this still remains my favourite in the series alongside deathly hallows im glad this series has resonated with me for so long is still stuck with me and will continue to do so always do you remember me telling you we are practising nonverbal spells potter  yes said harry stiffly  yes sir  theres no need to call me sir professor  its so dark in places in fact quite creepy but the flashbacks to the past in which we learn so much about voldemort or should i say tom riddle is absolutely absorbing  everything seems to be at risk here and you just dont know what will happen next nothing and no one seems to be safe anymore there is also a touch of romance and not just for harry which helps to lighten things but the tension in this book is palpable and it really isnt one you can put down  this book was so much better than i expected i cannot remember enjoying this book as much as i did now i actually thought this was one of my least favorite in the series but now ive realized that its actually one of my favorites i liked this book much more than the fifth and read it much faster i have no idea why but i found many parts in this book funny i laughed a lot more than usual when i read harry potter books this book was perfect and amazing in every way possible  my second favorite character in the series is draco and in this book i felt so bad for him he probably wouldnt have gone off to the dark side if his dad wasnt there first it was obvious that he and his mother didnt want to follow voldemort when he hesitated to kill dumbledore and was considering taking his offer of leaving the dark side i felt so bad for him also in the bathroom when he was crying really made me feel sorry for him because i dont think he would be all rude and mean if it wasnt for his parents and the way he was brought up  harry and ginny to me they should have never been a thing i have always hated ginny and the fact that harry starts to like her annoys me so much i hated her from the beginning and i have no idea why i always wanted harry with hermione and not with ron but my ships always crash but then again hermione is way too smart for harry and ron harry being with ginny slightly rubbed off on me after rereading this book but keyword being slightly although i still dont like ginny and i dont think i ever will i always disliked her since the beginning and i also dont think i will be completely okay with them together  this book proves that harry potter is an idiot and there was a reason he was never put in ravenclaw i mentioned this in my review of the first book but one day my friend and i were talking about hp and she told about how harry is so dumb first of all snape has been teaching him for  years  years yet harry wasnt able to recognize his handwriting i cannot understand how harry could not pick it up i mean snape had been his teacher for  years and was writing in front of them yet harry couldnt put two and two together hermione probably could have figured it out but she never read the book does he not pay attention at all i mean youd have to never listen or read anything in class to not pick it up  after he finds this book which has spells written around it he thinks its perfectly fine to start using them this book obviously belonged to someone who was a dark wizard but yet he sees these spells and thinks oh nothing bad should happen i mean this book only was written by someone who was interested in the darks arts then he decides to test a spell on draco and he doesnt even know what the spell does i get draco was trying to torture him with the cruciatus curse but there are still other spells he could have used to stop him then he tries to convince snape that his nickname is roonil wazlib obviously snape wont fall for that dont get me wrong i love this series and i do like harry but he is so stupid  i enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny i feel like reading this book made me love the series more and im not sure if that was even possible i wish after finishing the series i can erase my mind and reread the series i am so excited to carry on even though i know what happens next i want to wait for a little before carrying on to the last book because i dont want to finish rereading the series i dont want it to end becuase im so obsessed with this series another wonderful installment in this fantastic series jk rowlings writing style continues to blow me away the way she writes is just so easy to read and always makes me feel super comfortable in the world she created and what a wonderful world that is my love for each character grows bigger and bigger with every book their development is very well done  its realistic and believable  this book explores a lot of lord voldemorts past which was great because you learn so many things that make this character even more interesting the way these flashback scenes were integrated was so well done and perfectly fit into the story i also found the overall concept of the halfblood prince very nice my most favorite thing about this book has to be dracos arc and storyline though he is one of my top fictional characters ever created and to see him playing such a huge role made me incredibly happy it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more  voldemort is out in the open no longer trying to hide his return he and his death eaters are committing atrocities left right and centre once again the magical community is under threat from his tyranny and so they have to unite if there is any hope of defeating him  harry wants to fight as well but as he is still a student he is limited in what he can do but with the help of professor dumbledore he can learn all about the man who now calls himself lord voldemort learning about his past means learning his weaknesses  a rumour has been circulating through the masses that harry will be the one to kill voldemort in the end well the rumours arent wrong  neither can live while the other survives   description  this story is much slower paced than the others but i still enjoyed every moment even though they are in danger now that voldemort and co are killing openly  we get to see normal life at hogwarts for harry and honestly i could read another  page book about normal everyday hogwarts life  the atmosphere of this book is very different from order of the phoenix harry is more at ease now that the wizarding community believes him  i mean yes there were still some terrible things going on but things are now sort of calm at hogwarts  the humour in this book is so great from slughorn lavender brown and cormac mclaggen  this book is seriously entertaining every time  let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure  harrys lessons with dumbledore were from my favourite scenes and i think thats what makes the last few chapters completely gut wrenching  fun fact this book is the first one that ever made me cry i vividly remember  year old me crying into my pillow at  am   i will not deny that it still breaks my heart everytime i reread this book and it probably will everytime  harry potter and the half blood prince shall forever have a most special place in my heart  dumbledore made up for his absence in book  here but first sirius and now dumbledore i am drowning in the sea of sadness and crying harry potter is sweet  we sure see his growth hes definitely allteenager with girl crushes  spatsbut his anger has dropped away since the last book hes matured spreading his wisenesswings into an inspiring menschwizardteenager hes the only wizard to have survived the killing curse  defying voldemorts rage  revenge as the chosen one harry prepares to face his destiny with more insight and shrewdness than weve seen from him until now  this is one of my favorites in the series   book  is my very favoritethere is still lots of thrilling adventure but getting the backstory on voldemorts past was interesting as well which filled in holes while creating new questions  the last few chapters were intense the ending surprising  very sad its this book that made me wonder  did jk rowling have all  books preplanned before she wrote her first book hm  please note that this review may contain spoilers for the overall series not just this book  i listened to the bulk of this book while i did some spring cleaning it kept me company while i sorted through piles of books moved furniture around wiped down walls and shelves and vacuumed behind the heavy items that i only move twice a year it took most of the day and by evening i was putting things back in their places arms and back sore crying quietly to myself as dumbledore drank that potion im sure it would have looked rather ridiculous if anyone had seen me  once again i was blown away by stephen frys reading ive reached a point now where i feel like his voice is more familiar to me than those of people i actually know im quite sad that there is only one left but i also cant wait to start it there was a particular sense of sadness to this one knowing that it is the last year where they are students at hogwarts though the trio themselves dont know it yet i drank in every detail of daytoday student life  lessons quidditch peeves the fat lady the first time i read the book i was completely floored by harrys decision to not come back there is something so heartbreaking about him having to leave behind the place he considers home a year early the thought of harry potter without hogwarts was incomprehensible i had so been looking forward to their final year and suddenly things had veered off completely i still think it was brilliant of jk rowling to do that  the felix felicis chapter remains one of my favourites i thought they did a great job with this in the film too with daniel radcliffe demonstrating a talent for comedy that i hadnt anticipated but as ever in the book there is just so much more time to expand on things although i have always remembered that so much was cut away for the films its sometimes surprising to be reminded of just how much was left out ginny in the movies is fine and i think the actress did a good job with a small amount of screen time but book ginny is dynamic smart funny talented  a much better match for harry and i think their relationship works better in the books makes more sense also while ron still treats hermione pretty poorly here there is more nuance to it in the films its like a lot of his redeeming qualities have been stripped away and he is dumbed down a lot too hes smarter and more complex in the books and i do wish more of that had been kept on screen  its really dumbledore though who feels so much more real in the books i dont really know how to explain it but there is just something about book dumbledore that eclipses movie dumbledore i do think however that his death scene in the film was beautifully shot and i pictured it similarly in my head as it happened in the book siriuss death in the last book and dumbledores in this one really hit hard i find myself genuinely missing them as if they are actual people i have lost dumbledores death is almost unbearable and that realisation that i actually had faith in snape only for him let me down is still jarring even though i now know what is revealed in the final book actually knowing the truth about snape makes everything he has to do in this book even harder to read its all so brutal  also every sliver of information about tomvoldemort that we are given is almost uncomfortably fascinating why are villains so interesting  im counting down the days until my next audible credit so i can start harry potter and the deathly hallows its going to be strange to not have another one to look forward to and go on with i felt like that the first time i read the last book however the nice thing is i love rereading and im able to do that as many times as i want whether its a physical copy or audio buddy reread continues  i read this last almost the day after it originally came out and was amazed at the big reveals guess who dies and guess who the prince is  but more than that i was pretty blah and then very enthused as we learned more and more and more and more about mr riddle as harry kept sticking his head under water it was a hatelove relationship for me i wanted to know about our big bad i really did and then i also wanted to just get over all the cleverlyinstalled flashbacks and get on with the freaking story  that was before the movie  and so the movie came out and i was all like where is all the backstory for voldemort this is hardly anything this is just a brief little taste how are we supposed to feel the deep revulsion and pity for the man if we cant get more screen time for him and so i fell back on the bandwagon for all those pretty flashbacks  ah the trials and tribulations of a fanboy  this is like knowing frank herberts dune inside and out and then watching the lynch mindf and spending more than  of the movie filling in all the details that are left unsaid in the film that make the story deeper and more amazing than the acid trip that i was watching  okay maybe the hp film wasnt quite that bad and there were a lot of brilliant moments that were visual and direct linkups to the main plot in the hp movies so continuity was preserved very well still the lack of time with snapes younger cursecrafting self and the lack of all the mystery subplot with dumbledore himself made the end events kind of rushed and confusing within the movie  not so at all within the book  the book was a real pageturner for me again i love indepth reasons a lot a beautiful book with an end that made me cry   reread i really really enjoyed rereading this book and feel like i even loved it a little more than my younger self did its actually been a few years since ive last reread the hp books and i still remember eg that i didnt really enjoy the flashbacks in the pensieve the other times ive read this book and wasnt actually that interested in learning more about tom riddle but this time around those were actually some of my favorite scenes its funny how your opinion on some things changes as you grow older one thing that hasnt changed though is the fact that the ending once again made me very emotional  jk rowling uses the word clambered a lot like a ridiculous amount  ive never heard an american use this word one time in my life so i can only assume its a british habit to use clambered excessively to describe going over an object or else ms rowling never learned the words crawled or climbed as a child  she also has the most horrible habit as a writer of mentioning minutiae that no one gives a shit about anymore but then leaves out some very important details i have the perfect example to use from this book when draco malfoy tries to use one of the unforgivable curses on harry at hogwarts no less harrys not the least bit interested to tell anyone but when he turns a corner we get to read a entire page about peeves the poltergeist throwing chalk at him   again yes harry make sure and go tell staff that peeves is throwing chalk at you but leave off that boring business of the student trying to kill you in the bathroom such inconsistencies annoy me  also after rereading some  pages of harry potter so far this year i cant help but wonder   how are we to keep suspending our disbelief that the adult wizarding world times their actions to coincide perfectly with the school year at hogwarts i mean how can every evildoer in the wizarding world be inspired to perform their misdeeds right as the school year comes to a close in june couldnt she just one time have made some bad shit happen in february this is a writing habit that has just been way too tidy for me  and yet   here i was   rereading book  aloud to my middle child in our living room as my son was in the background moving his belongings back into the house for summer when i got to this part  sir you havent told us whats in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on slughorns desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled  my son stop moving set down the box that had been in his hands then came and sat down on the couch and said felix felicis my daughter and i nodded our heads in approval and hermione granger contributed its liquid luck  next thing you know my littlest child poked her head around the corner and revealed that shed been listening as well my middle child blew up in anger at her throwing a pair of dirty socks at her head but her little sister prevailed and came into the center of the living room and declared as she sat down on the carpet i just want to listen to the story  imagine me now feeling the bliss reading my favorite harry potter book to all three of my kids at once in the center of my living room on a beautiful spring day and that right there is the magic folks its not that im the worlds most engaging narrator its not that jk rowling writes novels like graham greene jk rowlings magic is in her storytelling  storytelling is not writing and not all writers are storytellers but good writing that contains excellent storytelling takes the reading experience to the sublime  we clambered to the climax of this story together and now we are poised to take on the last novel together next week  when i asked my middle child how many stars out of five for this one she answered one thousand  so one thousand stars out of five let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure   halfblood prince bits fans will love and  they might not  wired  jk rowlings harry potter and the halfblood prince is one of my favorites lots of questions answered in this installment along with an amazing story enjoyed ready for the deathly hallows first of all its the less action book in the series thats why many may get disappointed but i see its one important book for the character development and to wrap up the actual task of how harry should finish voldemort as at that book we learn more about his past also we realize secrets that the writer kept hiddenalthough gave some hints that proved it was there from the beginningabout what harrys facing the cleverness of showing the horcruxes idea was there since the early stage of the books is remarkable  one of the things i adore about harry potter that its set in the real world our world the beginning of that book implant that concept that the events were reading since book one is happening here in our real worldthe prime minister scenechapter is real amazing addition to the seriesand it include most of the major events we witnessed happened at the wizardry world through the previous books and how it affect our world  the characters get more complicated here at that bookas for snape secrets revealshocking for some and relieve those who always mistrust him being in the good side well plotted twist from j k which wont stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in snapes character also theres a depth in dracos character that really serve the plot of this and next book then the guardian role of dumbledore at harrys life start to manifest at that book then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world like the diagon ally scene was darker than ever  and theres also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age youll love the hermioneron relation in short  its the best way to introduce the beginning of the end of a saga  the longawaited eagerly anticipated arguably overhyped harry potter and the halfblood prince has arrived and the question on the minds of kids adults fans and skeptics alike is is it worth the hype the answer luckily is simple yep a magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission harry potter and the halfblood prince will blow you away however given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book including armored trucks and injunctions dont expect any spoilers in this review its much more fun not knowing whats comingand in the case of rowlings delicious sixth book you dont want to know just sit tight despite the earthshattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story but take one warning to heart do not open harry potter and the halfblood prince until you have first found a secluded spot safe from curious eyes where you can tuck in for a good long read because once you start you wont stop until you reach the very last page a darker book than any in the series thus f
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,i enjoyed the adventures of tom sawyer way more that this it seems most people prefer this book to tom sawyer i really cannot see why though this book was so dull i had to force myself to keep reading i kept waiting for it to get better the only parts i enjoyed were the very beginning and his escape from his father the feuding family and when he was revealing the truth to the girl who the king and duke were trying to rob i was glad when huck got away from them and was probably more disappointed than huck and jim when those leeches caught up with them ugh even tom sawyer showing up didnt improve this crap the boring and pointless stuff just went on and on and on part of me wonders if you get your book lover card taken away from you if you end up disliking a literary classic i really loathed this book from beginning to end  truth be told i am not really a mark twain fan at all every time we had a choice between reading one of his stories in english class i always chose any other author i could if the teacher gave us options  the only story of his that i did love from beginning to end was the diary of adam and eve  i will say that its a little odd that amazon has this story ahead of the adventures of tom sawyer since it would make sense to read that book before this one i of course knew the gist of both stories i mean i may avoid twain but i at least know what the subject matter is about so i cant say i went in unaware of how the language was going to be  the adventures of huckleberry finn is told in the first person by huckleberry finn we find out that after he and tom sawyers escapades in the first book which again i am going to say is weird that this book is ahead of that one in the list that huckleberry is living with the widow douglas who is doing her best to make him into a little gentleman or in hucks words civilize him  this entire book just continues on in fits and starts initially we get to read about hucks sadness to be locked indoors all of the time and his sneaking away with tom sawyer when he can then we move onto hucks father returning who locks him up in order to get his hands on hucks money then we have huck escaping his father and runs into a runaway slave named jim eventually huck and jim have further adventures sailing on their raft and we get introduced to even more characters  i am guessing that huck is a preteen or almost a teenager in this book based on his description and how he acts so there are some things that i think as a reader you can make allowances for for example you can understand at hucks age why he was so reluctant to be abetting jim in his goal to escape being sold by his owner eventually though huck starts to consider jim his friend and feels responsible for keeping him safe from harm but honestly after a while i was just kind of done with huck and jim  the plot moves so slowly seriously this story feels like it was a million years old since i felt like for every page i finished three more were born the story goes on and on past the point of mine even caring until we get to an ending that just made me roll my eyes for all the mess that mark twain talked about jane austen i would say that he should have definitely not have been throwing stones at anyone  i know during school our teacher went on and on about the brilliance of this book since mark twain wrote it in vernacular english ie he wrote it how people spoke by then which just was not done that time in the us  i am realizing that it may make it a more interesting book for some i completely hate it when a book is written that way see my gone with the wind updates and reviews if you want to know why reading how people speak is painful i stayed up all night just because i wanted to finally be done with this book today i was tired of trying to decipher everything that someone said at least when huck spoke i could understand it easier than when n jim spoke after a while i started to just skim what he said because i could barely make out what was being said  combining the vernacular english with the n word thrown out constantly i was pretty done with this book at the  percent point  the setting of the missouri did feel real you can tell that mark twain had experience with that part of the us and the rivers and embankments running along it but that alone was not enough to save this book for me at all  the ending when it comes i found to be simply ridiculous i wont get into it here for the overall review but i can say if i was huck finn i would have smacked tom sawyer a good one at this point i am not looking forward to reading the adventures of tom sawyer this book has to be one of the worst books i have ever read i believe that this book due to the language morals and overall storyline contributes nothing to the literary world  the immaturity of the language and lingo really confused me and just made the book terrible the slave jim has the typical slave language making the story almost impossible to read the moral be yourself and go where you like almost encourages children to run away when the going gets tough the overall childish storyline with huck and tom made me feel like i was reading a childrens book  i would not recommend this book even though it might be required for certain classes you just have to love a good ol great american novel that puts the ism in racism and the racism in american oops i dont like this author didnt like the travel books so thats part of the issue each person had their own nigger to wait on them writes twain no no no this book is not satire as some critics claim nor does it represent any point in time in america as some readers and critics claim nor is it funny as some claim nor is it well written here is a particularly silly line thought from finns perspective the sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before its a laughably terrible line and twain in his introduction excuses his own terrible writing with this comment in this book a number of dialects are used and about the plot of the story well twain again excuses his lack of ability to maintain one by writing also in his introduction persons attempting to find a plot in huckleberry finn will be shot ha ha at least one critic has excused this mess of a book as okay since finn himself might be black and there is a stunning amount of criticism making all kinds f excuses for this rot of a novel but there are enough of us readers surely to note the emperor is wearing no clothes the time for this novels place in literature has long gone ill refer to a s bestseller jonathan livingston seagull for comparison we know  years after the fact that seagull is a terrible book yet it did receive critical acclaim at the time and there was even a terribly boring movie in which a bird flies around for about  minutes with a voiceover of nauseating philosophy lets not forget true american history president abraham lincoln ended slavery and that thousands of white americans lost their lives in support of enslaved blacks i will admit a certain embarrassment about what people outside of america might think about us when reading this book there is simply no excuse for this book to still be in print but perhaps the only reason one should read this is to understand how racism or sexism is spewed by an author under the guise of literature twain is officially my least favorite author of all time and even if you can get by the racism this is still one amazingly boring read this is my opinion of this book and of twain i know people still love this author well to each his own meanwhile im going to find good books to read in giving a one star to twains classic i feel i owe the literary world an explanation reasons for disliking this book have been noted among other one star reviews unrealisticillogical character motivations hardtoread language and slang portrayal of race and race relations boring too much adventure and many many more i can see all of those things but they are not the reasons i have for giving this work a one star i have to give it a one star because the book in its narrative is lacking so much in basic reality that it is flatout sloppy  the unreliable narrator style typical in books written from the perspective of children mentally challenged individuals substance abusers and others of this sort is what im referring to i know i can appreciate this style of narrative as ive enjoyed many books and even movies done in this style in huck finns case my issue is that the truth is so far removed from the fantasy huck finns ridiculous dialogue that it becomes tedious and frustrating to figure out what is true and what isnt and its my belief and understanding that it is in the way the message is conveyed in this book which earns its honor in american history as a classic i do not find the message conveyed clearly uniquely or any way other than sloppily this book is a train wreck of runon sentences rambling and untidy tangents  i dont know about others but as a reader i feel bullied and overwhelmed by the narrative style its like being in a room with a very uncomfortable person listening to them ramble about some sort of obsession in a stream of consciousness with code only decipherable to fellow mad men i sincerely dont understand why anyone would enjoy the experience of reading this book its tiresome and frustrating and entirely too much to sift through in order to reach any sort of foundation if one exists to begin with  on the other hand if this is an example of a book which captures the spirit of the innocent which depicts the fantastical imaginings of a child then developmental psychologists across the world need to reexamine current models of mental development in children of huck finns approximate age  range to investigate the pervasive detachment from reality in which the majority of american readers seem to place our youth in other words i find the narrative of huck finn insulting to kids his age and anyones understanding of typical coping skills in unfortunate circumstances  the message of the story is a good one  its one that has been told in many other ways and in some cases better ways  but the bottom line for me is that the ends does not in my experience justify the means when it comes to this book found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water i covered up their facesi cried a little when i covered up bucks face for he was mighty good to me i personally hated the book  the adventures of huckleberry finn one of the reasons why i hate this book because its confusing just everything coming all at once i have to stop and be like wait whats happening here also because of the hill billy like language too another reason why i hate it is because its sad i dont like that a lot of people die to me its just slighty annoying about people keep dying cause you can get also bored with it the last reason why i hate this book is because its in a different time period which is not that interesting to me that it bores me to death overall these are the reasons why i absoultely dislike  the adventures of huckleberry finn to start off huckleberry finn is confusing because of the way he talk an example would be why yes dats so iid done forgot it a harems a bodnhouse i reckin like that you cant even make out the words another why its confusing is because everything goes from one way to the next i dont understand what im reading half the time and it annoys me that im reading a book that i dont understand clearly to continue another reason why i absouletly hate this book is because its pretty sad i dont like that the fact that main characters keep dying one after the other you would probably assume in the next chapter and the next chapter someone important is just going to end up dying i dont like this book being that sad i dont even read depressing sad books so its the first time really ever reading anything like this lastly i also hate this book because of the time period wow the s bores me to tears i know reading old times is good to read sometimes by learning about history is good to know but its not something i would want to read in a heart beat in conclusion these are the main reasons why i truly disliked  the adventures of huckleberry finn i hope i made it clear why i never liked it hmmm i feel like my  star is rather harsh and perhaps not deserved but its definitely honest the main reason for my  star is i found the language in this book so hard and sometimes impossible to read meaning i ended up having to skip passages and eventually flick through the second half of the book as i just wanted to get it done with which was a shame as i think written in a different light the story would have been a lot more appealing to me despite the  star review i can definitely see myself enjoying this book a lot more if i had studied it in finer detail say at school as it would probably have been interesting to look at things like hucks attitude towards jim further and his struggle between right and wrong  i can certainly see you can learn a lot from this book  all i can say for the  star rating is when i picked this up i was hoping i was going to get an exciting easy novel adventure story and instead i got an almost indecipherable rather dullonthesurface read sorry to those who love it but it wasnt what i was looking for maybe another time why on earth do people like this book its so badly written its one long hickerthanthou meander in search of a plot twain has talent but not here huck is pitifully bad  whats that you say critics give twain kudos for recognizing in  that blacks are real people and slavery is bad give me a break everyone who fought on the side of the north in the civil war in  figured that one out a full generation before the publishing date of huck finn and fought and bled and died for it it wasnt that big of a revelation or cultural insight for his eraexcept possibly for modernday literary critics who never read history twain was actually way behind the curve here i wish i could give negative stars for this i didnt like it at all i couldnt focus on the story it was boring the characters were boring when jim was talking i had no idea what he was actually saying in even shorter i didnt like it and im not going to waste time on writing a review this is the worst thing ive read in my entire life i wish i could have did not finishd this but it was for uni i hated every single moment of this when i started this book and saw its writing style i thought oh im going to like this then when i saw the first few egregious uses of the nword i was like oh no im not going to like this then at the midpoint i was like okay maybe itll recover in the last  chapters i was like oh my god when will this purgatory be over please someone set me free im getting a migraine and this is not a lengthy book by any means  the adventures of huckleberry finn is a classic i know that i also get that a lot of its overt racism is satire i get it and i still hate it there were so many times i was just tired so tired of jims slavery being riffed on as a joke that hes so uneducated he doesnt even know what a king is despite knowing who king solomon is so simple that hes fooled by every white person in this book including two twelveyearold boys and all the criminals who are complete morons and so neglected that he barely has anything to say  also characterization in this book does not exist tell me the difference between huckleberry finn and tom sawyer seriously tell me you cant because it doesnt exist also i didnt read this book to hear about tom fking sawyer who gives a  so yeah i gave this book  star i considered giving it  for the moment jim called huckleberry trash but the tedious ending didnt leave me feeling so generous i read this book when i was a sophomore in high school and i have no desire to ever read it again i know im in the minority when i say this is one of the worst classics ever i want to say something good about this book because its mark twain and all  so here goes the brilliance is in the style of writing all of those southern accents and different dialects for different characters  amazing that one person could make them all seem so real  thats all ive got  i dont like dated southern novels because i cant get past the common use of the term nigger even if its a period piece im just not comfortable with it  then the fact that hucks such a little troublemaker i mean i know kids grew up faster back then  but hes only  or  years old and hes faking his own death with animal blood and the like and smoking and running away with a slave and meeting all those characters  the duke and the dauphin the dead bodies the townspeople the aunts and everybody just laughed about his antics at the end oh thats just huck boys will be boys i just dont buy it  so definitely not my kind of story i read this for my american lit class i can see why it its a good choice to study for that class because its an excellent example of realistic fiction and very representative of the time period in which is was written  that being said i just didnt enjoy this book towards the end it did become more humorous and i found myself laughing out loud some but i just felt like there wasnt much of a plot and what was there felt very random it was kind of easy to tell that twain had some difficulties finishing the story and at one point thought he wouldnt because some things just felt like they had been thrown in haphazardly  so unfortunately not my cup of tea i feel guilty that i didnt like this book considering its a classic and all but i couldnt wait for this one to be over i probably wouldnt have finished except that its a book club read im not sure if it was the writing style or just that the story didnt grab me at all but i was bored reading this one it got very mildly interesting once tom sawyer showed up at the end but just barely perhaps im simply out of touch with my young boy self i understand that the grammar in this book is supposed to be horriblebut it made me hate this book because i just could not stand how bad it was this was a required read for me when i was a junior in high school and i refused to finish reading it its classic and i love classical books but i have to admit that this book isnt my style i think this is the worst book ive ever read i have read a lot of books i was semi excited to read this because it is well known and the because mark twain was on the mystery train island on poptropica but i was heavily disappointed awful book so hard to get through would not recommend okay the adventures of huckleberry finn by mark twain i think i tried reading it in high school but couldnt get past the first page last month i read the adventures of tom sawyer my first mark twain book and i thought it was okay not great not really even all that good but i liked it enough that i was interested in reading huck finn because of the two i think its the more popular book and i was curious to see what hucks adventure was like  the first big change i noticed between the books was that huck finn was in first person tom sawyer was in third person huck is also written more phonetically and theres slang in the dialogue especially from jim and the other few black characters despite this i still found it very readable the one thing that i hated seriously is how much he repeated the phrase by and by in tom sawyer he overused presently this is a major distraction for me and i think its just bad writing with each use of the phrase i just lose interest in the book i get tired of it its a completely needless phrase you can cut it out and the sentence most likely wouldnt be any different and its such an easy phrase to spot so that really hurt the books outlook to me  i didnt much like the protagonist the plot or the adventures i just found myself wanting to get them over with and get the book over with the king and the duke were especially annoying characters and really ground the book to a halt to me i was wondering why tom sawyer wasnt in the book really i thought he was a major character but he doesnt come in till the very end and he wants to launch such an elaborate plan to free jim it just got boring to me  an entire chapter on whether there were nine or ten spoons in the house it seemed like not a chapter would go by where huck didnt create some elaborate lie blow the lie and try to cover it up  i just got tired of reading his madeup stories  so i just didnt like it  i did like that there were nearly  uses of the word nigger though thats just about the only redemptive quality of the book i dont really see why its a classic save for it being old and there were a relative scarcity of writers back then in america particularly ones of any noteworthiness by itself i dont see the book as that good  so it makes me apprehensive now to read another twain book i peeked at his travel books like roughin it but it appeared to be less of a novel and more of an autobiography not really interesting to me prince and the pauper is one i have already and ill read that soon jumping frog is another on my list anyway between the two i liked tom sawyer more he just seemed to be a more polished character  so im torn between  and  stars   didnt like it   it was okay yeah it was okay but i didnt like it so it deserves like a  stars but thanks to all the by and bys im rounding down one star i havent really used goodreads that much but if they had a  star review i would use it on this book i really really disliked it there was no plot the characters left something to be desired and it was overall boring it was also very confusing i would not recommend this book to anyone i had high hopes for this book and they were stomped to the ground and put through a  horsepower factorygrade juicer do not read this book i lost interest so quickly that i ended up having to read the sparknotes for the chapters to figure out what i actually just read  i really dont understand how this qualifies as classic literature and even as literature i enjoyed reading curious george goes to the big city more than this and thats saying something if i could choose my least favorite book this would be it ive read many books in my life and this is literally the worst book i have ever read it is being considered being banned from school libraries for the vulgar language but i think that it could be banned for another reason its just so bad that an essay on ocelots i wrote in rd grade has more plot than it and it was nonfiction  now that im done ranting about the overall book im going to single out some people why is every character in the book an obsessive liar they are such bad people that you cant even relate to them and you just end up bored its like keeping up with the kardashians but less interesting if i had to compare this book this something it would be to the smell you get after the guy in front of you on the freeway runs over a skunk when you have your windows open so because a book was written how long that makes it a classic really i give this book  stars because ive read it in the year of our lord  and i know many will argue it must be analyzed contextually based on the time it was written and its satire but i dont give a shit and lets just say i was reading it in the th century when it came out id still give it  stars because id still think its a piece of shit nonetheless kudos however to those two rascals for trying to help jim out sorry samuel clemens aka mark twain but your book is not a classic and i dont care in what era you were born maybe im wrong maybe this is the reason why you shouldnt give important books to kids that will not understand them in a time when they need light literature and bees and bumbles and something soothing and easy and predictable and not something that i will learn to hate innocent age of  maybe this book is really properly fantastic but i will never know that because every time when i think about finn and twain i have an urge to vomit everytime i open this book and start reading where i left off i just end up in the land of nod first few pages had me laughing a bit but the time when huck met jim in the woods i told myself oh this is enough dont get me wrong i am a fan of satirical novels but i cant bear liking this one and the movie same hid too many details just so the public would like it  this author clearly doesnt know how to write i understand that slavery was a huge issue at the time but i didnt like reading such a racist book this was the worst book ive ever read and ive read twilight so thats saying something  stars  maybe im being harsh because i have been speed reading and writing about this book for the past  days but whatever this was quite bad i dont care about any of the adventures or any of the characters i am tired of jims freedom never being taken seriously and these annoying little kids using it as some fun escape plan i hate tom selfish little bratty little boy and huck youre just weird idk the ending was kind of bad and left me really unsatisfied i know this is supposed to be some great american classic but i hated it whoops maybe im just not smart enough to understand deeper messages behind this book but like upon first read i just really disliked it
Tolkien On Fairy-stories,tolkien was brilliant but even in his academic writing he writes in a way anyone can follow this is a pretty interesting read cool introduction on tolkiens definition of fairystories and to his concept for his theology in middleearth exited to get into the silmarillion for my tolkien class reading this is a fascinating insight into tolkiens world and his view of what a fairy story should be he does make some interesting points in his essay a lot of which i can agree with having read a variety of fantasy novels and fairy tales of varying quality honestly i would recommend this to any aspiring fantasy authors because i dont think you should make up a fantasy world from scratch without some ground rules and a few helpful pointers could certainly be gained from this  although reading over the various drafts and notes of the essay was a little tedious in the end im glad i did read it all the way to the end because the repetition ensured the significant points were drilled into me so i hopefully shouldnt forget it all too quickly  for what it is albeit not a thrilling novel this is a surprisingly engaging and informative book very glad i found this one disclaimer i dont know if the book depicted here is the right thing because it says it has over  pages i only read a  page essay so i may be cheating here  i already read tolkiens essay a few years back but i remembered next to nothing and had to brush up on my knowledge for my fantasy literatures class in university  i think i liked it better than last time maybe because my knowledge on fantasy increased or because i got a bit more skilled in reading theoretical texts what i liked the most about it is that you can really feel the joy and love that tolkien has for fantasy  or fairystories  and how much he truly believes what he writes it is also a rather notpretentious essay many texts i read on fantasy literature tend to diminish the genre or condemn it as childrens literature and that is absolutely not the case here i enjoyed reading this essay as fantasy is my  passion and i like thinking about the meaning behind it however this essay went down rabbit trails and half the time i didnt have any idea what tolkien was going with a idea or talking about this is definitely an intellectual sort of essay and i think was targeted towards a very different audience than i am that being said i did like some of the points and ideas this brought up i just wish it was little more concise and accessible livro lido para o desafio livrada  categoria um livro dissonante da carreira de um autor  i desired dragons with a profound desire of course i in my timid body did not wish to have them in the neighborhood intruding into my relatively safe world in which it was for instance possible to read stories in peace of mind free from fear but the world that contained even the imagination of ffnir was richer and more beautiful at whatever cost of peril the dweller in the quiet and fertile plains may hear of the tormented hills and the unharvested sea and long for them in his heart for the heart is hard though the body be soft being such a lotr fan i was quite disappointed by this i wasnt brought into the mind of the genius who constructed his own languages and multiple fantastical worlds i was simply confused and its not because i could not keep up with the genius i only read the essay not the extra commentary by editors read this for class and honestly read it so fast i can hardly remember anything all i know is to understand fantasy i should definitely do a read through soon this was an interesting read but i couldnt help but feel that i was attending a party i wasnt invited to the language is a bit convoluted awash in interjections and awkward phrasing but his point  when he gets to it  is simple fantasy literature is a legitimate form of writing and can carry just as much depth as anything else written  tolkien goes on to decry why fantasy works as literature yet fails as drama and that too often critics are angry at fantasy in literature because of its failings in drama  it is a misfortune that drama an art fundamentally distinct from literature should so commonly be considered together with it or as a branch of it among these misfortunes we may reckon the depreciation of fantasy for in part at least this depreciation is due to the natural desire of critics to cry up the forms of literature or imagination that they themselves innately or by training prefer and criticism in a country that has produced so great a drama and possesses the works of william shakespeare tends to be far too dramatic p   his validation of fantasy as a genre a thing too often lamented by somewhat snobbish fans of good literature is refreshing some selected passages  to many fantasy this subcreative art which plays strange tricks with the world and all that is in it combining nouns and redistributing adjectives has seemed suspect if not illegitimate to some it has seemed at least a childish folly a thing only for peoples or for persons in their youth   fantasy is a natural human activity it certainly does not destroy or even insult reason and it does not either blunt the appetite for nor obscure the perception of scientific verity on the contrary the keener and the clearer is the reason the better fantasy will it make if men were ever in a state in which they did not want to know or could not perceive truth facts or evidence then fantasy would languish until they were cured    fantasy is founded upon the hard recognition that things are so in the world as it appears under the sun on a recognition of fact but not a slavery to it so upon logic was founded the nonsense that displays itself in the tales and rhymes of lewis carroll if men really could not distinguish between frogs and men fairystories about frogkings would not have arisen   tolkien even defends the notion of escapism  in real life it is difficult to blame it unless it fails in criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds evidently we are faced by a misuse of words and also by a confusion of thought why should a man be scorned if finding himself in prison he tries to get out and go home or if when he cannot do so he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prisonwalls   overall for fantasy fans in general its a nice vindication to a form of literature that isnt simply mindless words granted there is a glut of fantasy now that is total crap but thats not the fault of the genre but of market that sensationalizes shit  why not  stars because the language trips over itself too much i dont have any background on english literature and any other literatures so please forgive me when i said the language in this book is a bit confusing but yeah overall i understand what tolkien is trying to say  that the land of faerie is mystical not in the rpggameworldsense  that fantasy is a natural human taste since we imagine things like seeing a face on a tree or cursing the heaven for seven days without any rain  that fantasy is an art that has been left in the attics for a very long time  i was reminded of leguins from elfland to poughkeepsie and i think those who loved leguins essay would love this one as well this textbook is great for fans of tolkien and for those who wish to analyse his literature in a more critical manner this book isnt huge but the detail is suffice for academics who are beginning their research into tolkien or the fairytale genre providing information and analysis ready to develop further research this was one of tolkiens essays and it was pretty okay for me its a bit long but its about him laying out what is exactly a fairy story to him and how fairy stories tie into fantasy and who they are for it was an interesting story but i found it a bit boring at moments but i learned a bit about tolkien by reading this i had to read this for my high fantasy class i love the prose and the theory is solid but the subject bores me literary essays and criticism never really excited me id much rather read the books than read about their psychological and cultural impacts a very scholarly look at fairy tales and their difference from other types of stories by the master of fantastical worlds this essay consists of  good stuff and  tolkienesque ramblings worth the read but requires patience explains his theories well but he digresses its hard to imagine a more thorough and accessible critical treatment of a single work than flieger  anderson put together here there are not many short works so robust as tolkiens original essay as to deserve a booklength treatment and few of those have authors so popular that a mainstream publisher would take on the commercial risk of supporting such a book  having grown up reading an oddly truncated and partly incomprehensible early draft version of the essay misprinted in an ancient copy of the tolkien reader it was a joy to me to read the final version of on fairystories included here and in the monsters and the critics which turned out to be far clearer and more systematic than i thought flieger  anderson demonstrate that this work is not the lucky product of a brilliant but scattered mind  an impression one easily derives from exposure to tolkiens drafts  but a fullyformed contribution to literary and folklore studies deserving of its watershed status in those fields and of flieger  andersons own contribution nothing can be better said than this backcover quote from the cambridge review it goes far to explain the nature of tolkiens art and justify his success this is a really dense essay and tolkien has a habit of following intellectual rabbit trails if you dont mind taking a long time to read a short piece it is definitely worth the effort he discusses not only the history purpose and misconceptions of fairy tales he also discusses with great passion and importance how they relate to the nature and soul of man the fact that tolkien himself essentially bought fantasy back into the world and showed that it was not a genre only for children really makes me happy after hearing him say some of these comments loved reading this essay and seeing it in the context of the theoretical formation of a whole genre it must have made quite the impact especially with tolkiens lord of the rings books coming after it it was also just written very nicely and even though i had to use a lot of brain power for certain passages it felt kind of cozy doing so  the edition by flieger and anderson was masterfully put together it gives you interesting context in the beginning has helpful commentary notes on the essay itself and in the back extensively compares various editions of the manuscript and highlights important differences that last part wasnt all that interesting to me but its impressive scholarly work nevertheless i have read on fairy stories by prof tolkien previously as a pdf online but i remember rushing through it a little primarily because im not much of a screen reader recently i came across a physical copy of a book containing the essay by tolkien and a commentary of it by verlyn flieger and douglas a anderson the copy also consisted of various manuscripts from over the period of time during which the essay was written i decided to revisit the essay and read the commentary along as a supplement this time around  firstly an introduction regarding what this essay is about seems to be in order while theres also a brilliant introduction by verlyn flieger and douglas anderson in the book itself essentially the essay is a published text containing much of the talk tolkien gave as the andrew lang lecture in  in this endeavor he attempts to answer questions about what fairy stories are where they originate from and what purpose they serve in our lives the essay has proved monumental in demonstrating what makes a work of fantasy enthralling to its reader his own massively successful works of fiction which reflect a lot of the ideas from the essay are a testament to its wide scholarly acceptability  in the first part of the essay tolkien addresses the question  what are fairy stories contrary to what would be a fairly common deduction tolkien states that fairy stories are not stories about fairies but theyre tales of mortals like us in farie he points out how stories that pertain simply to fairies or elves would be a boring affair because there would be nothing in them that a reader could relate to or develop a sense of belongingness towards the more interesting tales are often those of mortals who accidentally wander off into farie or encounter it at its border but that begs the question  what is farie well tolkien loosely defines farie as the realm or state in which fairies have their being but he also points out that it is not possible to pin down a foolproof algorithmic definition since one of the properties of farie is that it is indescribable to the mortal thought it is an otherworldly place of enchantment and beauty but also of utmost peril in the lord of the rings lothlrien fits the textbook idea of what farie is it is beautiful beyond measure full of magia and enchantment of the elves and yet perilous aragorn says  perilous indeed fair and perilous but only evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them previously in the same conversation boromir says and now we must enter the golden wood you say but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor and it is said that few come out who once go in and of that few none have escaped unscathed say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn it is not in the nature of mortals to exist in farie thus any mortal who perchance enters into that realm cannot leave it without going through a fundamental change in themselves this interaction of a mortal with an enchanting place like farie is what makes fairy stories interesting it sets it apart from the mundane tales of mortals and elves in their own separate realms despite that being the natural order of things since according to tolkien farie cannot be caught in a net of words and can only be vaguely described it is not possible to have an allseason definition of it however it is possible to eliminate stories that do not have the element of farie and hence do not qualify as fairy stories he points out that upon putting a lot of socalled fairy tales to this test it is revealed that we have been using the term fairy stories very carelessly most fairy tales do not touch upon farie at all and if they do it has to do with a very minor part of the story this brings him to exclude stories like travellers tales beast fables and any story that uses the machinery of dreams from being fairy stories he offers a great deal of explanation for each of these categories and gives sufficient examples  another thing tolkien goes into is the origin of fairy stories this inevitably leads him to discussions about mythology and subcreation i have decided to not go too much into the depth of this subsection in this review because tolkien himself passes lightly over the topic besides his two words on the matter are the best way one can read about it so im going to take this opportunity to ask anyone who is reading this review to definitely have a look at the actual essay itself its a delightful and eyeopening read i will get into more reasons as to why you should check out the essay in the next part of this review which would be put up as a separate post but at the same time as this where i talk about my favorite section from the essay fantasy  after a thorough discussion on farie and according to tolkien passing lightly over the topic of its origins which is still pretty darn thorough for most people like me he finally moves over to the part for which i absolutely love this essay fantasy here he talks about what fantasy is and what purpose it serves in our lives in the section titled children tolkien talks about the unfortunate common belief that young children are the only audience for fairy stories and calls it an accident of our domestic history he points out that people who hold such opinions essentially view children as altogether different creatures because the appetite for fairy stories has nothing to do with ones age he brings up his own example as to how he developed his taste in mythology as an adult and through his love for languages this discussion leads him to introduce his idea of secondary belief granted that children are better at the suspension of disbelief he argues that nothing of that sort actually happens when one reads a fantasy or a fairytale what is far more effective in gluing an individual to a particular story is a secondary belief the writer creates a secondary world with a solid inner consistency of reality such that even though the content of the story is unnatural in our primary world it has been woven in perfect accordance with the rules of the created world that a reader finds no resistance in immersing themselves in that world in his words the moment disbelief arises the spell is broken the magic or rather art has failed you are then out in the primary world again looking at the little abortive secondary world from outside  tolkien calls fantasy the most nearly pure form of art and so when achieved the most potent he talks about how some people confuse fantasy with dreaming which involves no art and with mental disorders illusions which is not a phenomenon under ones control however it is not always that people with such views are to be blamed because fantasy as tolkien puts it has an essential drawback it is difficult to achieve i have personally encountered multiple people who believe and have told me how fantasy is easy to write because it owes no accountability to reality nothing could be further from the truth it is an incredibly hard task to achieve the inner consistency of reality in a subcreated secondary world a secondary world has its own set of rules which might be different from that of the primary world but still have to be internally consistent as soon as that consistency is even slightly trifled with the enchantment ceases to be and the fantasy fails there is further a group of people who think of fantasy as childish folly i have known multiple people who believe that since fantasy has no bearing on reality and vice versa it is a useless indulgence for one that is not true as it becomes clear in the next section of the essay and secondly even if it were so that fantasy impacted our lives in no way the escape from our cruel and desolate primary world is good enough reason for one to delight in fantasy and fairy stories tolkien also includes a stanza from his poem mythopoeia which he wrote to cs lewis as a response to him calling myths lies even if breathed through silver  in the final section tolkien moves on to talk about the impact of fantasy in our lives this is where he talks about how fantasy and fairy stories offer us recovery escape and consolation all three of these things he points out are needed more so by adults than children he expresses his disappointment at how there are individuals who scoff at the idea of escapism he gives the example of a prisoner of war to illustrate this why should a man be scorned if finding himself in prison he tries to get out and go home or if when he cannot do so he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison walls the world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it everyone goes through this emotional roller coaster that is life with all its flavors and phases sometimes the reality of our primary world becomes too grim and dull to bear in times like such why should anyone be judged in wanting to escape to a secondary world which promises joy and contentment if but only for a while consolation is also closely tied to escape tolkien points out that fantasy offers a very important consolation that of a happy ending he calls this a eucatastrophe which is one of the most important themes of this essay and of tolkiens own legendarium he goes as far as to say  the eucatastrophic tale is the true form of fairytale and its highest function now again there are several edgelords who claim that a happy ending is a boring form of literature because there is no guarantee of a happy ending in real life which again hearkens back to the idea of escape yes things dont always take a satisfactory turn in our primary world which is the very reason we need eucatastrophic tales in our lives what would be the point of escape if the secondary world one escapes into is equally gloomy our secondary world should help us find our hope and get us through the problems of the primary world that for me is the main reason i indulge in fantasy i would like to bring in a paragraph from the lord of the rings to exemplify this further there peeping among the cloudwrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him for like a shaft clear and cold the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach  even though i know that nothing about this story is present in my primary world samwise gamgee isnt a real person i can meet and the ephel duath isnt a place i can take a flight to yet each time i read this passage i feel hopeful there might be a lot on my mind things might not be going my way and everything might seem bleak but i can remind myself that it is only a passing thing i can always turn to these stories and count on them to escape from everything and find consolation in the fact that at least while im with these characters everything will turn out well  i would like to add here a stanza from mythopoeia  such isles they saw afar and ones more fair and those that hear them yet may yet beware they have seen death and ultimate defeat and yet they would not in despair retreat but oft to victory have turned the lyre and kindled hearts with legendary fire illuminating now and dark hathbeen with light of suns as yet by no man seen tolkien ive read excerpts of this essay before but this is the first time ive gone through the whole thing hes basically talking about the significance of imaginative fantasy as a way of thinking he addresses what he sees as some misconceptions about what imagination means and what escapism means basically his whole point is that there are aspects and attributes of reality that can be expressed in no other way but to employ fantasy and that by employing it we are bringing into being in some measure the fulfillment of our creation ie we become subcreatiors under the divine creator i was actually a bit surprised to hear this coming from a catholic i dont think mr lewis even took it that far  one of my favorite parts of this essay is where he differentiates enchantment from magic magic is a bit more like manipulation to him like youre casting a spell on someone to make them think believe or behave a certain way enchantment is about creating a shared experience it unifies rather than imposes one vision or reality upon another a good read for anyone with an interest in fairy stories tolkien provides a simple to understand explanation of what he views as fairy stories along with analyses related to their structure meaning and purpose what makes this book particularly nice is that one does not need to have any academic background at all in fairy stories tolkien treats the subject from the perspective of one who has come to appreciate fairy stories during the course of his writing as opposed to someone whose career has been built out of dissecting them this approach i think makes the book much more approachable  it is also nice to see tolkiens writing in another context as this text contains much of his familiar style but toned downed somewhat for the subject matter reading this will also help the reader better appreciate the distinction between the hobbit and tolkiens other works  well worth a read i had read bits and pieces of this in various forms over the years some probably from tolkien biographies some in christian books maybe its even quoted in the lord of the rings dvd special features but its certainly worth reading in its entirety and in the end explains for me why tolkiens trilogy is unmatched in its ability to move me to both deep joy and deep grief while pointing to the evangelium his less know work  mostly more or less kind ideas that have been extracted by the publisher afther his death clear insights into a perceptive mind even when hes writing essays and lectures tolkiens phrasing and leaps of thought are lively and fascinating i would say that this little book along with his letters are the  books that give us the clearest insights into the mind of tolkien  the book is basically  the final text of a lecture delivered in the late s and then edited into an essay to be read it also then includes a very helpful editors commentary as well as an analysis of the  or  different draftsversions that jrrt wrote before the final edition  one key theme that will interest people are tolkiens view about subcreation the idea that true fantasy must create a world that is internally selfconsistent to allow the reader to believe in the secondary truth of the world tolkien abhorred the notion of forcing the reader to suspend belief  as it creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the world also subcreation echoes jrrts christian faith in a creator god and humankind as made in gods image and therefore charged with the task of displaying gods qualities through creation of literature including fantasy  tolkien also argues cogently that fantasy is not for children nor is it a lower form of literature  indeed true fantasy has lofty ideals and aims  not least these  recovery  true fantasy allows you to take a step back from the mundane and wellknown and perhaps to reevaluate what you think it shows you the real truth behind the everyday  escape  not from reality but into reality it is the boring mundane and meaningless everyday life that is our true prison and fantasy allows us to escape into the truth behind fantasy reminds us that we are made for eternity see ecclesiastes  perhaps  consolation  the rd aim of fantasy is to restore our hope in beauty faith and goodness and to equip and encourage us to live in the light of the eternal drama this includes consolation from death the ultimate enemy the bringer of meaningless  and points us towards the true myth that is the gospel of jesus christ yes its true  unless you have an awareness of the christian gospel of salvation and the christian worldview of time and eternity you will always find tolkiens writings a partially closed door hinting at something you can never lay hold on just saying  anyway  to wrap up  its not an easy essay to read and i think it probably needs  or  readings to begin to get it to sink in but its worth it and if it helps us to read fantasy especially tolkiens version of fantasy with the right aims then it will be worth the reading
Les Misérables,ladies and gentlemen a chapter of my life has come to a close today a new leaf has turned les mis is over never again will that brick haunt my coffee table or nightstand i am a free woman eleven yearselevenive stolidly worn the chains of oppression from that hugo guy  never again  what was happening eleven years ago i was in my freshman year of college a friend and i made a pact that we would start reading through classics together and had the massive misfortune of choosing les mis as our first purgatory er project  as this was one of my first massive tome classics i think i had to prove to myself i could finish it because im vain and dont want anyone to think i just couldnt appreciate itive slammed down anna karenina the silmarillion and moby dick with gusto and enjoyed them all in the end this is just a matter of taste  victor hugo strikes me as pompous and i recognize thats entirely subjective but holy moly the man likes to hear himself soliloquize to the nth degree theres a sentence thats  words long with  commas and  semicolons read that again  the level of historic detail is astoundingor details in general at one point we slog through about fifty pages of detail just describing the sewer system all because one of the characters walks over a sewer grate the excessive info dumping is frequent and frivolous  hugo also enjoys expounding on philosophy love and death among other things for pages on end via runon sentences  ive come to the realization that i just may not be cut out for french novels typically they involve one romantic interest pining to death over another one after simply looking at them for the first time eg through the windows and dramatically seeking death at the first instance of inconvenience to a potential relationship also watching her through windows creepy bud creepy  id rate this book a pg for some mild language adult themes and violence dnf at  and thats a  pages the book is way too long and unnecessarily slow a book with  and something pages should have a great start right but this one doesnt all i know from what i read is bishop thats extremely selfless and unnecessary descriptions of things that have little to do with the story  might finish it someday but for now i just have to stop here before this book kills me usually i dont do middle of the book status updates but i just feel like this really needs one its been three months and still i havent managed to work my way through this book now granted i feel you cant count the month of november because of nano really who has time to read when youre writing a novel in  days but honestly this is the longest ive ever taken to read a book especially in my adult years and honestly a huge reason is because i just kind of hate it so much i really just want to tell hugo to shut up and get to the story i dont need that much excess its like im reading a history book with a little bit of of a plot i really like jean valjean but hes the only one i like reading about and his story keeps getting inturrupted about people i dont care so much about the only thing that is keeping me from just giving up on this book altogether is that people tell me its worth it that it gets better i just wish i didnt have to go through  pages to get to the plot line ive always wanted to pick up the hunchback of notre dame but ive pretty much decided against that after les mis    this is the day ive officially given up on les mis i tried i really did and  of the way through the book im still counting it on my read list with les mis thats like two books but i was sitting in the panera today fiddling with my kindle touch because it was being glitchy today and i realized that i wasnt even that upset that i wasnt reading this book on my lunch break im never excited to read it never look forward to in and in all honesty dont really care to know about the ending spoiler everyone dies it takes place during an uprising of course everyone dies  the big flaw in this book is that hugo just doesnt know when to shut up and let the story take over i liked the characters and the actual story that was going on i just couldnt handle all the history and exposition that was inturrupting it hugo could be a great story teller he would be a terrible historian its like calling it les miserables is a warning to the reader that yes you will also be miserable reading this book im sorry i like to enjoy my books when i read them mr hugo  good points hugo does make some great characters i really liked jean valjean i like all the characters i was presented with because they were interesting and dynamic people the story when hugo actually allows it to take over is interesting i like seeing everyone interact and see jean valjean get out of desperate sitations and see him be persued by javert i like seeing javert fail a lot valjean and javert have an interesting dynamic and the best part is that neither of them are evil people you dont really dislike javert you realize that hes just doing what he thinks is right but you really love valjean too because he is a very benevolent man these are the things that hugo does right  inenvitable hugo just needs to learn to shut up a little maybe one day ill read the abridged version usually im completely against those but in this case it just might be warrented war  peace seemed  pages too short this book unfortunately seemed  pages too long victor do we really need  full chapters about the sewers of paris and the poetic side of excrement and are we really supposed to believe that of all the thugs thieves murderers and other scoundrels haunting paris the one guy inspector javert is really intent on capturing is the guy who stole a loaf of bread  years before yeah i get itthe french legal system was unfair but cmonthis is ridiculous feeling disappointed with myself for putting this book on dnf did not finish one this copy is a mass market paperback that contains small fonts this will give terrible headaches if ill continue further two this is a classic war fiction i already saw the  movie which is fourhour long that would be enough and i need to move on i need fiction stories that could bring my imagination to another world of the unknown feeling disappointed with myself for putting this book on dnf did not finish one this copy is a mass market paperback that contains small fonts this will give terrible headaches if ill continue further two this is a classic war fiction i already saw the  movie which is fourhour long that would be enough and i need to move on i need fiction stories that could bring my imagination to another world of the unknown life is miserable and then you die i only watched the musical but the entirety of the story was just so blood boiling and cringe worthy that ill put the actual book onto the re reading waiting lists end not to mention the wolverine dude is completely tone deaf longer review the name says it all folks theres not a lot of joy to be had for the characters in this book i read it because i saw the musical for the first time a few years ago and loved it i was super surprised how different this was there was almost no politics at all in this book also javert seemed insane and very strange  but the biggest problem was jean valjean i understand that he was trying to live a virtuous life but he kept needlessly shooting himself in the foot and he was completely inconsistent if it is bad to let another person be punished for your crime isnt it also bad to escape from the police he drew the line in arbitrary frustrating ways he had a martyr complex that made the book quite unenjoyable  and why not tell marius that you rescued him that wouldnt have been a bad thing at all it only made things needlessly confusing  ive seen others criticize hugos writing style and ill just go ahead and agree with them twelve paragraphs when twelve words would have sufficed yet for all these words the characters are almost complete mysteries  i could go on and on but what is the point its a classic nothing i say is going to change that but if you havent read it yettrust me folks stick to the musical where to begin  the digressions perhaps with a  word discussion about baseball or elephants or something equally irrelevant to the topic at hand i mean what the fuck is up with the digressions page after page after page on some napoleonic battle or the sewers of paris or some other equally tangential topic was this guy paid by the word ans no but dickens was and oh how it shows  the coincidences and then theres the coincidences i hadnt read any reviews before starting in on either book which was perhaps a good idea as i dont know if id have had he will to throw myself into either thousand page slog but some of the reviews were spot on as with this example  in this gargantuan novel everything seems utterly improbable every plot operates through coincidence one way in which hugo emphasises the coincidences in his novel is the persistent failures of recognition this occurs on the level of the characters  where a father does not recognise his son or a criminal does not recognise the very person he has been pursuing for years and it occurs on the level of the narration where the narrator withholds the name of a character throughout an entire episode  the characters les mis is fully stocked with a cast of thin vague uninteresting allegories beginning with jean valjean a christlike figure whose saintliness is beyond parody at the novels climax hugo describes how marius began to have an inkling of how incredibly lofty and solemn a figure this jean valjean was an unheardof virtue appeared to him supreme and meek humble in its immensity the convict was transfigured into christ  alex bellos unlike dostoyevsky or tolstoy hugo does not provide us with an indepth psychological study of valjean instead valjean is revealed through his actions much in the manner of the lives of the saints  another critic says these characters live much closer to the realm of medieval allegory than that of modernist fiction and reading les misrables you quickly determine that there is no reason to linger over paragraphs sussing out the characters subtleties what few they possess are rendered so boldly as to resemble neon nuances and hugo himself tells you about all of the subtext right there in the text sometimes twice  and the others are as bad marius is a bland nonentity fantine a character a hollywood scriptwriter would reject as too ridiculous and javert a preposterous villain his motivation pretty much nonexistent and sketched in a couple of paragraphs which is telling as theres one thing you cant accuse hugo of and thats a lack of detail  the style to describe his work in progress he jotted down a list of hyperbolic adjectives astounding extraordinary surprising superhuman supernatural unheard of savage sinister formidable gigantic savage colossal monstrous deformed disturbed electrifying lugubrious funereal hideous terrifying shadowy mysterious fantastic nocturnal crepuscular that is so hugo using fifty adjectives where two would have sufficed invariably to emphasise an re emphasise his overweening mawkish romanticism  he always has to intervene in his own voice endlessly sermonizing social realities are not so much observed as postulated by an olympian author its at times like the garrulousness of an old man in love with his own voice reading les misrables one often wishes hugo would shut up  les misrables achieves its immense length partly for this reason and partly because the bits of dialogue are in fact large lumps that the prolixity is sometimes appropriate to the speakeras when hugo renders the empty grandiloquence of a trial lawyer or the drunken philosophizing of the college student who impregnates fantinedoes nothing to help you pay close attention to it and the fact that hugo will sometimes reiterate a couple pages of information or restyle the same idea five ways in five successive sentences may make you think that he thinks that you are not in fact paying close attention which you arent  no wonder it took him  years to complete  all that survived of his preface to the novel was a single dogmatic sentence as long as social damnation exists through laws and customs artificially creating hell at the heart of civilisation and muddying a destiny that is divine with human calamity as long as the three problems of the century  mans debasement through the proletariat womans demoralisation through hunger the wasting of the child through darkness  are not resolved as long as social suffocation is possible in certain areas in other words and to take an even broader view as long as ignorance and misery exist in this world books like the one you are about to read are perhaps not entirely useless  a few other critics alexandre dumas it felt like swimming in mercury  flaubert said it was a book written for catholicosocialist shitheads and for the philosophicoevangelical ratpack i found in this book neither truth nor grandeur the characters are mannequins sugar candy figures you are not allowed to paint such a false portrait of society when youre a contemporary of balzac and dickens  turgenev recorded a conversation with a magnificently pompous victor hugo in  we were chatting about german poetry victor hugo who does not like people talking in his presence cut me short and began to give a portrait of goethe his best work he said in an olympian tone is wallenstein forgive me dear master turgenev interjected wallenstein is not by goethe it is by schiller it matters not i have read neither goethe nor schiller but i know them better than those who have learned their works by heart  sound familiar victor hugo the donald trump of literature thanks for that footnote wilbour  heres something you should know about the wilbour edition it was written in about  months and published the same year as the original text  as you can probably imagine that didnt end well even the most experienced translator would find it an impossible task to accurately translate a nearly page novel and indeed wilbours edition is abridged to only  pages in under a year id estimate a more reasonable timeframe would be closer to  years depending on the style of writing and the overall difficulty of translating ie how many culturally specific references do the characters use a lot of slang etc  charles e wilbour in all his rushed wisdom used an antiquated style of english and allegedly tried to capture the feeling of the original by retaining french word orderas well as the occasional french word or sentence which he didnt bother to translate whatsoever this would probably be appealing if your goal is to fetishise french culture otherwise its clunky dated and jarring absolutely none of the context behind the original novel is present the politics translate poorly none of the puns make sense which is the worst offense oh and its heavily abridged with over  pages knocked off wilbour also rearranged several of the digressions for reasons unknown so the structure isnt even true to the original  if youre looking to read les misrables dont get the wilbour edition if youre looking to study translation or wilbour himself then you could probably stand to have this in your collection for the love of chimerical grape what a dull behemoth of a classic i really enjoyed the beginning of this book but hugos habitual interruptions of exhaustive politicalhistorical diatribes really turned me off so much so that when he came back to the story i had actually forgotten where he had left off its like he just slapped some essays in the beginning of random chapters for reasons unknown one of the few books in my life that i couldnt force myself to finish i couldnt even get through half the book because it was that aggravatingly boring  if you want to read about the moralistic trials and tribulations of an exconvict thats actually exciting and wont put you to sleep i recommend the count of monte cristo stealing is stealing whether its a loaf of bread in france or the gold toilet in trump tower this shouldnt be condoned by a society and especially not in a book the size of my hands if you know what i mean up yours little marco anyway denny goes ahead and does that namely by removing over  pages worth of the text including moving an entire section the digression concerning argot to an appendix replacing one of hugos original poems with a much shorter version penned by denny himself and taking it upon himself to improve upon the original in all sorts of frustrating and misleading ways if you want to read norman dennys opinion of what les misrables should be then full fucking steam aheadbut if you want to read les misrables skip this edition  im not even convinced that denny liked les misrables or hugo at all or even the act of translating this thread claims that dennys version  carries much of the poetry and force of the original however since it is not always a wordforword translation at times a bit of accuracy is sacrificed denny does mention in his introduction that a good translator should be more concerned with the intent and spirit of the author and a translation that is too literal ie a wordforword rendering is often not the best way to achieve that which i obviously think is a load of bullshit coming from denny even if i agree with the concept in principle regardless of whether thats indeed something with which a good translator should be concerned denny is not a good translator by pretty much any metric fuck this guy dont read this shit the verbal vomit of victor hugo it should be titled in the singular and not the plural  le livre misrable  the miserable book  this book claims to be about the french revolution  that was the only reason i picked it up but it has nothing to do with the revolution rather it is a shoddily written cheap romance  victor hugo pukes words  literally i dont think i have read a more excruciating and painful to read book the superfluity of the vomit of words out of hugos pen is a terrible impediment to any kind of enjoyment one can have out of this book charles dickens is riveting in comparison  and what is it about anyway a shoddy romance and a misguided bunch of moralizing the daughter of the martyr woman becomes just another pretty airhead and marries just another handsome airhead  wish that the author retrenched on that verbal vomit a little to endow either of these with some semblance of cerebral prowess  and a perpetual invocation and glorification of a god that has actually allowed the most squalid unfairness to happen and therefore rather merits calumniation is just plain abject where is the fairness of said god yet somehow it is glorious  on the whole a really sad and shoddily written book with a million too many superfluous words and superfluous digressions a pretense at relevance to the french revolution which is really not justifiable and only a mere morsel of a story that the reader has to painstakingly dig up like a proverbial needle out of the haystack  if you insist on reading this read only the first sentences of each paragraph and you will not miss anything better yet read an abridgement of an abridgement even better skip it altogether and pick up a harlequin series novel les misrables is probably the most difficult book that i have ever read in my entire life thus what i have to say about it can be summed up rather quickly  i do understand why this book is a masterpiece and the language hugo used was beautiful to behold  however knowing absolutely nothing about french history trying to read les mis was like taking to my brain with a grater  what i found problematic about hugos writing was his inclusion of longwinded soliloquies which provided his comments and opinion on the political climate of france at the time this made the story incredibly difficult to follow in points and also detracted from the charm of the whole affair much of the things that hugo had to say were actually particularly insightful and interesting but i question their place in an already very long novel the books story alone spoke volumes about hugos political feelings and presented them in an interesting and subtle way this technique and subtlety was completely overwhelmed when hugo launched into his political diatribes  most disappointing was that when i emerged from this reading i felt that i had gained absolutely no insight or knowledge about historical french politics despite having read hundreds of pages of musings on the matter  i suspect that the abridged version is much more palatable and that is something that i never thought i would say if you want to read about political philosophy against the background of the french revolutions then this is the  page novel for you one of my least favorite stories i disliked every character and found the story to be extremely boring i read this book as a teen and then again in my forties thought i might like it better and still hated it donougher stopppp it like for real stop  i just think its incredibly difficult to translate this book without including appendices detailing the historical and linguistic and political contexts behind it the one thing christine donougher gets right in my opinion is the annotations a bit too miserable for me i tried to read this but i couldnt get into the story or the writing i wasnt enjoying what i was reading so i decided to dnf gah les mis this book torments me i just want to finish it but i never seem to be able to make it through its such a nightmare its not that terrible when im reading it i dont know why i struggle so much i got about  hours into the audiobook and decided that this was not for me although its a classic i just couldnt listen anymore in the  hours that listened i had got to know a priest pretty well and that was about it nothing really of note had happened i feel this was just too much of a slow burner for me  on my bookshelf is a gorgeous copy if this book i just cannot get through it dnf for today but maybe someday les misrables was a tough one for me i very nearly dnfed this one i was however reading the unabridged version of the book id recommend anyone interested in les misrables pick up an abridged copy for at least the first readthrough reading the unabridged version of les misrables feels like victor hugo has dumped all of the research he did for the storys various events into the novel itself this equates to the book being  story  history lesson  english lesson   philosophy lesson  authors opinion and  superfluous descriptions the events directly pertaining to the characters are interesting and enjoyable which is why i awarded les misrables two stars instead of one  i started reading les misrables shortly after the movie came out in  i prefer to read the book before seeing the movie and i attempted to do this with les misrables and boy did that backfire nearly a year after the movies release i still havent seen it and i initially stopped reading les misrables about a quarter of the way through about  pagesand all my excitement for the story was dried up i had reached what my family now refers to as the waterloo section for those not familiar with book the waterloo section is a huge detour from the story and i would guess its    pages in length this was the first roadblock i reached in my journey to finish  in the waterloo section the author communicates to the reader an enormous amount of information regarding the battle of waterloo and the readers reward for making it through this monstrosity is a minute glimpse at two of the secondary characters this is pretty indicative to what the rest of the book is like and hit  more roadblocks before the end this is not a book you can just breeze through reading this book is a serious commitment of time and brain power  ill be perfectly honest with all of you the only reason i finished this book is my boyfriend bribed me with nerdy collectibles and a new pc game im not proud of it but i needed that motivation to finish the book never in my life have i experienced the range of emotions i felt during my readthrough of les misrables but thats not necessarily a good thing so there is this guy and he is in prison and then  sidebar something about woods or maybe trees or like landscaping or is it grass and fields or maybe something else ive lost my train of thought  and then he tries to break out and  sidebar about a lot of writers youve never heard of and lots of inside jokes and references probably no one at the time even got and lots of weird social philosophizing that doesnt seem to have much to do with anything and  then he gets out and everyone is mean to him except this priest and let me tell you about the priest with my favorite phrase he is the sort of person or she is the sort of person because even though i will write three pages of text when three words would suffice i dont trust the reader to know what the hell im talking about so id better out and out tell you what you are supposed to think and feel about each character  and then he randomly gets really rich by inventing something that seems rather dodgy even though he has shown no previous aptitude for invention or engineering and has no history whatsoever in the industry still hes got to be rich for all the stuff were getting to next so boom there you are hes rich  and so on with entire chapters devoted to a minute dissection of the battle of waterloo the history of a fictional convent complete with secret rituals and most and least favorite nuns and silly games played therein and etc ad naseum with the entire irritating tale pushed laboriously in sisyphean fashion up one hill and back up the same one over and over by the same repetitive plot devices  watch the movie although maybe turn the sound down when russell crowe does that thing he is doing when i think the script was calling for him to sing i made myself read this for a book report onceworst decision ever its way too long and dry omg so boring just watch the movie  
Brave New World / Brave New World Revisited,a difficult book to rate i thoroughly hated the journey random thoughts that popped into my head along the way included   id like to go to iceland right now  i could really use a soma tablet  dystopia is so not my cup of tea  the ideas communicated are both profound and profoundly disturbing but the vehicle used to communicate them to the reader is simply excruciating lame shallow characterizations along with a simplistic and simply boring plot  a lethal combination in the excellent foreword which i dont recommend reading until the end christopher hitchens suggests that the characters are twodimensional for a reason  because the society of bnw has snuffed out their emotional and intellectual depth this may be so but it makes for painful reading nabokov detested the novel of ideas for very good reason  they just arent much fun  and yet i thoroughly enjoyed the climactic conversation between the savage and the world controller here we get to hear aldous  channeled via mustapha mond  brilliantly lay out his full dystopic vision i just couldnt bear the path taken to get me there  brave new world revisited  the earlier chapters on population pressures overorganization and propaganda are quite prescient and interesting i lost interest once he began delving into how the future state will brainwash and distract the individual and i suspect he did as well in the end notes huxley is quoted as saying upon completing bnw revisited i am sick and tired of this kind of writing  finally it must be said that huxley was a futurist but was also inevitably a product of his time his obsession with eugenics his belief in the hereditary nature of intelligence and his obvious antisemitism detract and distract from his core message  still i couldnt have hated it all that much as i just added island and point counter point to my goodreads queue this one just didnt live up to the hype i had built up about it i feel bad giving it  stars but i just didnt enjoy it that much im sure i should have read it long ago not sure how i made it through high school and college without ever having read this book but i dont remember it ever being assigned im glad i read it even though it wasnt exactly a pleasant reading experience its fascinating to see through huxleys eyes as he is writing in the s i think and imagining what the future could hold babies being created in labs and jars long before anyone ever invented ivf or anything lots of social conditioning starting from the time a person is born recordings of certain sayings being played over and over in childrens nurseries while they sleep etc  of course i couldnt help but compare it to george orwells  which is similar but also really different it was interesting to find out this was written almost  years before orwell whereas orwells dystopian vision imagined these powerful dictators who can see everything you do in this case huxley imagines that people are so created and conditioned that there doesnt even need to be a dictator because people will just be like sheep following along with how theyve been programmed  unfortunately some of these very characteristics of the society that he imagined made it difficult to really care or feel interested in any of the characters for example in this imagined future there is no such thing as family  no mother no father no siblings no family structure at all no marriage no permanent bonds of any kind are encouraged or even allowed this gives the characters a flat feeling and it feels like nothing really matters because there are no real connections between people so it was hard to really care what happened to these people this was an ok book first off i enjoyed the futuristic feel of the book even though it was written back in the thirties the idea of humans being mass produced is pretty wild the thing that i didnt like about it was the dryness of the book i did not see a plot buildup nor a very high climax in the plot in some sections the book is really dense and i would have to use sparknotes on it to try and decipher its meaning in some other cases it was a good read that i could follow i am the type of person that if i feel like reading a book i would want to just sit down and read it i dont want to use my brain to try and get a small message out of it but thats just me the book has a lot of input on politics i am not into politics so this book was sort of a bust for me the characters in the book were probably more interesting than the actual book you have a sex addict lenina a socially awkward penquin bernard a noob john and a hypocrite the dirsctor i dont regret reading this book but i wish that it was a little more entertaining and less prophetic there are so many layers to brave new world one aspect that is often overlooked is its exploration of what it means to be human and how far humanity can be stretched and altered before basic humanness disappears i think this is why the book still resonates today  even though the methods have changed we are still using technology to play with the idea of humanness whether it be computers genetic engineering or something else the book raises questions about the interplay of science and technology with power and social engineering huxley both reveres and fears science he welcomes its advances and comfort it brings and fears the unintended consequences of its application and science that has no reference to a system of ethics then there are the questions of sex and love and happiness and suffering and how a person can function both as an individual and a member of a society and whether the two are even possible  the novel itself is only half a novel  it is really more a place to hang ideas on and all the characters function as authorial ciphers the plot is superficial a mere way to explore the world huxley has created and all its strange and terrifying consequences but its still compelling funny and bizarre to read i still wanted to keep turning the pages  brave new world revisited is less interesting but still fascinating as a piece of paleofuturism  a forecast from the s about what the world would look like today it is interesting how much huxley got right and how much he got wrong many of the issues he was concerned with no longer trouble us but others are just as relevant today as they were when he wrote it  i was unimpressed with the introduction in this edition written by christopher hitchens his ideas were confused he was clearly pushing his own agenda rather than introducing us to the work and ultimately i feel he just didnt understand huxley or his novel disappointing the story refused to go where i would anticipate it to making it pretty fascinating and engaging however there are still many unanswered questions which i feel would have enhanced the story but were left out in favor of continuously outcasted protagonists and an overall wider message i had just finished orwells  and was on a dystopian reading bender when i picked up brave new world zamiatins we is next on the list maybe because i am comparing the two novels sidebyside having read one then the other brave new world fell far short of expectations huxleys dystopia is a much less terrible place than orwells in fact it doesnt seem all that bad although it is the world state there are tiny pockets of escape there are the reservations where primitives live and practice a quite different lifestyle there are also islands to which awkward members of society can be sent if necessary mustapha mond points out that bernard marx is in fact privileged to be sent to such a place and although the effect of such a society is to dehumanise human beings removing their need to strive and keeping them emotionally immature all their lives it is at least apparently done for a benign purpose the difficulties of twentiethcentury life have been smoothed over in order to keep the members of society happyand by and large they do seem to be happy at least in a trivial sense bnw had no endearing character no one i cared about or who was central to the story bernard was a whiny douche john savage was bizarre i liked lenina and mustapha mond but they were peripheral characters i know aldous huxly intended on depicting brave new world as some kind of dystopia however after reading that book brave new world seemed more like a paradise there was no war no diseases no famine and no unemployment not only is everybody employed in brave new world everyone has the preprogrammed the job of their dreams to top it off there was hardly any crime everybody knew each other well and there are wild parties everywhere who cares if that society stifled philosophic inquiry with problems in the world such as war unemployment increasing food prices increasing health care costs brave new world seems like a more promising place if you want a real dystopia real horror read orwells  now thats a world i would not want to live in nice world building very inventive for the time that this was written in i do wish we would have seen more of a protagonist and what happened to bernard and lenina at the end but what was there was pretty satisfactory as for the brave new world revisited part i must admit that i glossed over most of it because  its rather philosophicaltheoretical and  im tired surprisingly until now ive never actually read this classic work of dystopian or dystopian utopian science fiction know the plot and the ideas behind it yes read excerpts and quotations yes but never the book itself i found it quite readable and entertaining and of course frighteningly prescient  and even more so for the  brave new world revisited written from a posthitler perspective bits of huxleys writing style reminded me of norman spinrad  which is surprising considering that spinrad was writing decades later and an ocean away  stars average  for the novel  for the nonfiction i have been told and told again how important and crucial it is that i read this book well now i have and heres my review it is widely considered a selffulfilling prophecy however after having read this i find myself on the opposing spectrum yes some things that were included in this novel are similar to the societal change that we have been experiencing nevertheless i struggle to wrap my head around the idea that this is truly the direction our civilization is heading towards this book is what i would call a dystopic science fiction book the society that is depicted in this novel is considered to be a utopia the keyword here is considered it is in fact more of a nightmarish depiction of what aldous huxley believes the future of humankind is going to look like is it perfect no this society only offers one kind of freedom sexual freedom and that is the only reason why it is successful if it did not have this freedom it would not have lasted for all those centuries one might be perfectly fine with having only one type of freedom but it is hard to imagine our current society morphing into a society that is so limiting and technologically advanced all in all i liked the book but thought that brave new world revisited was a waste of my time i felt like the authors perspective on the world had narcissistic undertones which made it a bitter read apart from when i was in the mood the names of the characters were clearly inspired by marx and lenin him explaining the reason behind that would have been more interesting than reading about useless commentaries and lessons on how the world works the whole thing about the savage reservation and the savage was disturbing and gruesome to read about the ending was bitter and did not make me want to read this book ever again the writing was academic but at time very addicting the book brave new world written by aldous huxley takes place in the future world where people are made and they are born with levels in my opinion this is a great book however the comparison to  and animal farm this book arent as good this book is not directed enough in my opinion but it does use interesting details to show how the world is range it is really not hard to see how things around us are set in a mould which is bound to crumble in the very near future almost all of our institutions are broken overlaid with increasing human ignorance and laziness i can imagine how mr huxley could extrapolate and think up of the dystopian scenario he talks about  i make it sound it was a cinch but after realising that the first book was written in  an age which had no internet i am only in awe of huxleys capability to firstly forage a lot of information and then to connect those disparate bits to paint a holistic vision which he only would confirm three decades later this is worrisome  is there a way out  didnt like this one as much as  neither characters nor social commentary hit me nearly as hard i can see how this book is the father of more modern dystopian fictionbut to be honest i felt like i didnt quite get what was happening a lot of the time there were phrases or objects referred to in the book t shaped building or oh ford that i didnt understand until i read spark notes after i finished the book this book was written in the s and the reference to ford and t is henry ford and the creation of the model t the assembly line production maybe i should reread with this knowledgebut i think the outcome would be the same obviously there are disturbing things in the plot the citizens of the world well most of them not the savages are lemurs who do what they are told or rather are conditioned from conceptioncreation to fit a certain role in society everyone is content i wont say happy because they only think they are happy when they consume soma a drug that numbs anything that doesnt fit their view of life  i feel like its in the last chapters of the books that the murkiness of the rest of the book clears up mustapha mond one of the worlds controllers explains to john the savage things of the brave new world happiness or freedom a brave new world chooses happiness not real happiness as people are conditioned through pavlov conditioning to like and dislike other classes of people books nature etc anything that might distract from their jobrole in societymaking them obedient without forcing them daily its engrained in them so you cant have happiness if you are given the freedom to choosethat in itself creates possible unhappiness there cant be works like shakespeare because that writing comes from tragedy or social injustice and their community doesnt allow for thatbut its not forced its just the way it is it reminds me of the giver for most of the people everything is gray  people are contentat least they think they are there are crazy ideas of conception no mothers or fathers those are bad words so its test tube creation and genetic manipulation creation of different physical traits and characteristics for different castes as well as cloning everyone belongs to everyone sexpromiscuity abounds as well as consumerism there can be nothing old like shakespeare etc because they want consumerism to thriveall are young not wrinkles thin and happy and if you arent or dont fit the mold whatever caste you belong to then you get shipped to an island as i write this i realize why this is a classic once the mud clears there are tons of topics to coverfreedom vs happiness the caste system pleasure island scenario genetics promiscuity drugs for escape but without some extra info for me personally it is a little hard to understand it might make a good book club book if additional information was providedthe discussion would be great  i started this review as  stars but after writing my review i give it  i believe it is a book that will stay with me for a while as a disclaimer i havent read the second part of this book a brave new world revisited so ive seen many arguments about this book vs  in which it is discussed which one is a better representation of reality in how our society would have been controlled so i read them back to back in order to keep them fresh in mind for comparison  as far as the plot and the writing style i definitely prefer huxley he has a more fluid style than orwell in my opinion and the plot seemed more realistic in terms of human nature huxley also made it more entertaining by switching point of views a few times and often switching back and forth between scenes quickly this can be confusing if you dont pay attention but it also adds some exciting build up to the material orwell did have some flashbacks but kept solely in one persons point of view this wasnt a detriment in itself but i couldnt identify with the character and while winston had some depth he was mainly unlikable from my viewpoint which i dont think was intended  these books are often presented as warnings of the government scope and overall control of the peoples freedoms so i had that in mind as each author laid out his message both books present good points in how people can be controlled orwell warns of a time where government forces compliance and huxley warns of a society that holds pleasure above any morality or truth i think both have merits and both rightfully condemn the society they created in the book both have very intricate and well thoughtout plans for how such a society could exist and both come up with very clever details which make the story more believable and more effective however they do differ in the overall message and in the reasoning behind why the society exists in the story the way it does i loved for example orwells new speak language that was created to control the people in the story it was a very good example of how people could be controlled and it definitely causes the reader to think however i thought that his how in the way society worked was a lot more thought out than the why the leaders of the government were one dimensional and it seemed to me a childish view of the world huxley on the other hand was a little less clever in how his society functioned although still pretty detailed but his reasoning was much more compatible with todays societys than orwells story huxleys invented society started with an admirable purpose but veered off course along the way into a land of vapid and easily controlled zombies this to me is a more interesting idea and certainly more believable i think huxleys cautionary tale is a more effective one in terms of pure message even though orwell certainly makes some good points  having said this i cannot ignore the amount of troubling underlying messages lie in each book i know they are from another time and should be taken in context but we glorify the classics and i think thats a mistake we can still appreciate the overall message while condemning the ignorance present in them for one both books paint women as vapid and one dimensional among the few smart thinkers as portrayed by the authors are solely men and even the smartest woman is used in some way and treated poorly in  the main character even admits wanting to rape and kill his future love interest andthis was after insisting that all the women were much easier controlled than men of course in brave new world the savage society that is somewhat glorified in comparison with the new society abuses a woman for seeking out sex this is after many men have come to lay with her and fed her drugs charming then even in the new society where sex is common and promiscuity is encouraged the wording for which they describe the events are having the women not often the other way around and again in this book there were a couple albeit smaller inferences to rape this behavior was not seemingly brought up to condemn the behavior but was merely are part of unavoidable human behavior secondly in brave new world huxley seems to glorify pain and suffering while in context it is embracing choice vs blind happiness i believe this could have been illustrated better the savage john was beating himself with a whip and speaking about deserving pain and this seems to be who the author wanted the reader to identify with as he made the main arguments against the new society i agreed with him on many points including the pursuit of science and truth and the freedom of choice but i think it is troublesome to celebrate pain without purpose i suppose you can make the argument that johns purpose was to please his god but thats one issue i have with many interpretations of religion and i definitely dont identify with someone who believes they must suffer in their existence for no tangible goal of course this is from a secular viewpoint so i obviously do not see the reward in this behavior in any case it didnt seem to work out well for poor john either although it wasnt really his fault i suppose that was really a metaphor for promiscuity and vapidity stomping out religion and morality though at any rate i did appreciate the satire behind calling a person a savage while he quoted shakespeare  i do recommend reading this book as well as  if only because so many people reference it but i would advise that you take what they say with a grain of salt so to speak awful clunky writing superb concept  huxleys nightmare vision of a future dystopia in which we live tragically removed from our natural selves is simultaneously one of the best books ive read and one of the worst hard to rate really a thrilling mustread that is regularly infuriating and semiunreadable often feels like a bad translation of itself but the concept and vision are so strong that you keep going page after clunky page i found the story interesting but definitely dated and it took me a good  pages to get into the novelstart finding it entertaining the characters are definitely onedimensional and not terribly interesting but the book is interesting in the ways in which the author aldous huxley forsees many modernday issuessocial ills i would definitely recommend that anyone interested in the novel read the version with the brave new world revisited included it allows a reader to get inside huxleys head and better understand the issues he raises in the novel itself and howwhy he was analyzing them i didnt find myself marking anything when reading the novel but did mark many aha moments or interesting thoughts in the revisited section of the book  comments i noted in the revisited section  no people that passes abruptly from a state of subservience under the rule of a despot to the completely unfamiliar state of political independence can be said to have a fair chance of making democratic institutions work i cant help by thinking of much of the arab spring when reading this line and find huxleys understanding of such issues as early as  fascinating again no people in a precarious economic condition has a fair chance of being able to govern itself democratically liberalism flourishes in an atmosphere of prosperity and declines as declining prosperity makes it necessary for the government to intervene ever more frequently and drastically in the affairs of its subjects making me think of the  attacks in the us the resulting patriot act and a resulting restriction on civil rights huxley then goes on to say there are certain historical economic demographic and technological conditions which make it very hard for jeffersons rational animals endowed by nature with alienable rights and an innate sense of justice to exercise their reason claim their rights and act justly within a democratically organized society  propaganda in favor of action that is consonant with enlightened selfinterest appeals to reason by means of logical arguments based on the best available evidence fully and honestly set forth propaganda in favor of action dictated by the impulses that are below selfinterest offers false garbled or incomplete evidence avoids logical argument and seeks to influence its victims by there mere repetition of catchwords by the furious denunciation of foreign or domestic scapegoats and by continually associating the lowest passions with the highest ideals so that atrocities come to be perpetrated in the name of god and the most cynical kind of realpolitik is treated as a matter of religious principle and patriotic duty bring me to mind fox news donald trumps current presidential campaign and even such movies as american sniper as the ways in which it attempts to inaccurately rewrite historical fact  huxley notes on the same topic later in their propaganda todays dictators rely for the most part on repetition suppression and rationalization the repetition of catchwords which they wish to be accepted as true the suppression of facts which they wish to be ignored the arousal and rationalization of passions which may be used in the interests of the party or the state as the art and science of manipulation comes to be better understood the dictators of the future democratic leaders as well will doubtless learn to combine these techniques with the nonstop distractions which in the west are now threatening to drown in a sea of irrelevance the rational propaganda essential to the maintenance of individual liberty and the survival of democratic institutions reminds me of the differing ways in which the republican versus democratic parties appeal to their voter bases in todays media  the survival of democracy depends on the ability of large numbers of people to make realistic choices in the light of adequate information a dictatorship on the other hand maintains itself by censorship or distorting the facts and by appealing not to reason not to enlightened selfinterest but to passion and prejudice to the powerful hidden forces as hitler called them present in the unconscious depths of every human mind  in brave new world nonstop distractions of the most fascinating nature the feelies orgyporgy centrifugal bumblepuppy are deliberately used as instruments of policy for the purpose of preventing people from paying too much attention to the realities of the political and social situation little did huxley realize that modern governments would not need to make such distractions tv entertainment modern music a deliberate tool of policy but that instead people would seek such diversions on their own although it is possible that such things are being used deliberately by others in an effort to keep people from focusing on sociopolitical realities that are unpleasant in their time well written book and it kept my interest until towards the end its worth the read it did feel to me like a fear based view of the future not that thats bad just feels a bit dated maybe its because i was born in the mids and we saw images of the future in flying cars conveyor belts everywhere etc but this was clearly before its time so seeing humanity being manufactured and culture manufactured and maintained by rules to make everyone happy with pleasure only to maintain stability what happens when a savage comes into the picture well done should it be as highly rated as a great book as it often is ill get back to you on that onev doesnt hold up to my high school reading experience thats for sure huxleys writing is even worse than i remember and ive read enough of him to know he was never a prose specialist even the ideas are so extreme as to be mostly cartoonish wrapped in his clunky halting commaheavy purely expositional writing with no real characters to speak of the fact that this has become a lasting cautionary classic speaks more to the paucity of sound ideas in the early th century than to any real quality it might have  not that there arent some accurate predictions here a society of drugged distracted consumers is one of the main problems huxley was warning about and  voila  here we are in st century smartphonelandia and we may not have soma but we sure as shit got every other prescription drug you can imagine ive seen lots of people debating just which of the dystopian classics weve come more to embody this or  and my response to that is why cant it be a little bit of both orwells doublespeak and police state are certainly either omnipresent or imminent  as for which is the better novel well its  by a long shot honestly the only thing that brave new world appears to have of lasting value is the concept of soma oppression by pleasure instead of pain and maybe the danger of relying on technology though huxley himself seemed to have a lovehate relationship with science  i hate to say it because ive always considered huxley one of my favorite thinkers and i still love his minor masterpieces island and the doors of perception  heaven and hell but upon rereading this and the mostly middling dated commentary he included thirtysome years after the fact im having to reconsider that status  this review is for brave new world only  brave new world is a dystopian novel set in  af after ford a new epoch of human civilization most of the world is governed by a single world state though there are also ungoverned tightly restricted savage reservations in the civilized world everyone is happy healthy and well provided for natural child birth and family are things of the past children are decanted in hatchery and conditioning centers and predestined in early development to belong to one of five castes alphas betas gammas deltas and epsilons the higher castes alphas and betas have privileges and mentally demanding jobs while the lower castes perform menial labor with the epsilon semimorons doing the most simple yet everyone is happy due to hypnotic conditioning during years of sleep in early childhood each caste thinks it would be terrible to be any other this book was more interesting in that it was first published in  there are so many pieces that are reflected today the opioid epidemic that is a crisis today mirrors the soma dosing that all of the citizens took in the novel to keep them happy this is interesting in itself in that there is a medication on the market today that has the trade name soma it was originally developed as a muscle relaxer and became a drug of abuse especially when combined with opioids and benzodiazepines the descriptions of the water guns used by the police that contained anesthetics to control a crowd mirror the taser of today other descriptors of class divisions were very interesting the controller talking about how all of life is lived inside a bottle just of varying sizes and the result of trying to change the bottle sizes one of my favorite lines in the book is when mustapha mond tells the savage that he is choosing the right to be unhappy the beginning of the book was a bit dated and tedious but by the end it was thought provoking and worth the read commendable for its significance in satirizing and later defining the sf genre regarding utopia and debatably important too in its predictions and criticisms though its science aged poorly and its contents had been done to death by the time i got around to it that isnt the fault of the author with that said however brave new world is somewhat lackluster it lacks an engrossing world or indepth characterscharacter arcs or anything that really gives it the defining substance it needs if read in any way other than as the roots of a genre andor a satirical jab at the ideal world its simple and rather prone to spoonfeeding you its points rather than employing much nuance  ultimately i walk away from it with only one big question with its themes  both john and bernards relationships with society megacorporate presence the use of control over society the main characters primary conflicts hyperconsumerism c all in a futuristically technological world  taken into consideration would this technically count as a protocyberpunk novel kind of the polar opposite of  the society in brave new world was much more intriguing than the society in  and the fact that they actually rewarded people who didnt fit in instead of punishing them made the idea of this type of society being sustainable seem a lot more realistic  as opposed to  i found the books treatment of women to be very problematic the only female main character happens to be the only one of the main characters who never rises above the world states brainwashing throughout the book she keeps on almost getting there but not quite and then she ends up stuffed in the metaphorical fridge also if im not mistaken all of the male main characters except for john obviously are alphas while lenina is a beta boo had to finally read this classic novel long known for its dire look at a future world written in  aldous huxley takes a very imaginative look at a world where every action by every person is completely controlled by government he has envisioned a dystopian world where everyone must be happy or face the consequences highly imaginative fo
The Alchemist,this book has crossed the boundaries of books and has taken a life of its own creating a movement all around the globe  santiagos journey and spiritual quest the people he meets the dreams he has the omens he encounters and the nature he speaks to are all things that we can relate tothings that weve either forgotten about or simply dismissed as childhood fantasies it is all about finding your personal legend and pursuing your dream regardless of any hurdles and about being spiritually connected to the universe which is part of us and part of god we are all one  reading this book always sets me back on the right path towards achieving the dreams i have put on hold we always try to do what everyone expects of us like pursuing a career that you hate just because that is what everyone does recognizing my personal legend being able to talk to the trees sky ants the core of the earth the air particles and to my heart feeling a deeper spiritual connection with everythingeveryone that is around me feeling god inside me and not being afraid of failing or facing challenges are just some of the few things this book has given me  it is maktub that coelho writes this book shares it with the world and affect so many lives this masterwork is a legend and a precious treasure  paulo coelhos masterpiece tells the mystical story of santiago an andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure  his quest will lead him to riches far differentand far more satisfyingthan he ever imagined santiagos journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along lifes path and most importantly to follow our dreams whenever i felt lost depressed sad numb conflicted frustrated exhausted i get this book into my hands and follow the journey of young shepherd santiago who is looking for a worldly treasure as like ts eliot says  the journey not the arrival matters  this journey is about self discovery fighting with your own demons letting your heart being your own eyes and leading you throughout the dark and threatening roads of life its epic uplifting motivational inspirationalheartfelt poignant  here are my favorite quotes of the book when we love we always strive to become better than we are when we strive to become better than we are everything around us becomes better too  the simple things are also the most extraordinary things and only the wise can see them  remember that wherever your heart is there you will find your treasure  dont give in to your fears if you do you wont be able to talk to your heart  there is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve the fear of failure  and when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it there are too many things one can learn from the alchemist its all about following your dream and about taking the risk of following your dreams which is actually so difficult to do and there are very few people in this world who actually do i mean risk it all just to follow your heart and your dream beauty is the author is so right in saying that when u decide to follow your dreams the entire universe conspires in your favour which he called as the beginners luck and we all have been witness to this beginners luck at one or other point in our lives also he talks about a stage in our journey towards realizing our dreams where everything just goes haywire and there is everything working against us and it almost takes us to the brink of abandoning everything and just getting back to what was so familiar and comfortable ie our usual daily life which we get used to this is actually the time when we are being tested for one last time and it means also that we are really close to our objective the example given was really great and yes nothing new but we forget simple things in our life like the darkest hour of the night is just before the dawn it is actually true that so many of us just leave the struggle when it gets really tough and the chips are really low whereas actually we were so close to the objective if only we would have had a little more patience we would have been there in one of the episodes he talks about death yes the fact we always forget the only reality about our life it is a constant which is not going to change rest everything is uncertain there are a lot of us who either think that it happens to others and then there are others who are so busy running after the materials that they dont have time to think about anything leave alone death yes and those who do think about death mostly fear it some fear death because of the physical pain attached to it such people actually fear the pain rather than the death i am one of them and there are some who think they do not want to die because its not time yet for them to go ironically but true this decision about timings has thankfully not been left to us so how do we get over the fear of death or make it our friend a companion and not waste our beautiful life worrying about dying all the time one of the possible solutions lies in this book it reads if i have to fight it will be just as good a day to die as any other yes very much right one would never know when he or she wakes up in the morning that if it was the last day of his or her life and in fact that day would not be any different from all the other days already spent so why not take everyday as the last day of our lives and live it up frankly speaking i really know what i am talking about because i am in a profession which involves a lot of risk and death doesnt have to look for reasons it can just spring up from any bush in form of a small little piece of metal called a bullet coming out of the darkness of the night or just a deafening sound from under a culvert that i cross everyday here everyday can be the last day of my life every meal can be my last every call to my wife can be the last time i would hear her sweet and loving voice and the kids anyways so what i personally follow is everyday when i wake up or every time when i move out on an operation i say to myself what a beautiful day to die and there on i just do what i have to and what i have been taught in all these years in the army and go through all the motions and concentrate on the job at hand rather than worrying about my death and i am really at peace with the fear of death another beautiful thought which i came across about death was in the novel by the author called confessions of a pilgrim i derived from it that death can be visualized as a beautiful person who is always sitting besides us so close to us that it travels with us wherever we go and it also accompanies us to our bed its a beautiful companion a faithful companion the only one who will never be unfaithful to us rest all the companions are just lesser mortals and have been unfaithful at one point or other death always stays with us and actually speaking thats the only companion who would accompany us all through our lives right from the moment we acquired some shape in our mothers womb to the moment when we would get the vision of that white light and that feeling of lightness when we would finally leave this body also sometimes expressed as vastra clothes in the indian mythology as per the indian mythology the soul never dies it is indestructible it only changes a body just like we change clothes our soul is a part of god and it goes back to him we can find the mention of the mighty soul of ours around the last portion of the alchemist where the shepherd realizes that ultimately it his own soul which is the hand that wrote all and his own soul was the part of soul of god i firmly believe that there is no fiction involved in this story of the shepherd but this is a true expression of mysteries and realities of our life which we never pause to discover there is message that this book wants to convey to us i have never been into writing anything ever in my life yes not even a personal dairy but since the time i actually started writing which was just a month back i realized that if we just write our thoughts as they occur the resultant has a touch of mystery because what we wrote with all our heart and soul sometimes tends to surprise us we tend to learn from what we ourselves wrote we never realized that we had so much inside us and we dont know from where it all came the hand that wrote all yes i think its our soul that speaks out the soul we never recognized the one we never knew the one which is part of soul of god all religions have over all the years have preached a man know thyself you will find god look within yourself u will find all the answers these words are so common but how many of us actually are ready to pause and give it a try it may sound crazy may be the book has a effect that may appear really crazy but i am sure there are some people who would identify with me may be when paulo coelho wrote this book his soul was revealing itself and thats why some of us can identify with it because our souls are the part of same soul of god just like his is may be these lines of his novel were written by the hand that wrote all  many people simply love this book while many others think that it is overrated i truly madly and deeply love this book i still remember a younger version of me reading this book while sitting perplexed at the crossroads of my life the above lines from it had given me immense energy to face the setbacks and move forward in my life with the required enthusiasm this book will always remain close to my heart this is a mustread one if you are looking for a simple book that will inspire you and change your life this book is very inspiring and what i really need right now to motivate myself with my everyday endeavors in the end the boy in the story who was searching for his treasure despite the long travels and experiences find his treasure not in the place where he suspected it to be but in the place where he came from its just pretty ironic that what have you looking for is in the end is just beside you right from the beginning its just that what he learned and discovered from his travel is another treasure that he should realize in order to appreciate himself and the things around him  a very inspiring and positive book it actually gives me hope that the things that i aspire for will in the end i would achieve if only i strive hard and dont lose hope until i get it sometimes the detours and the problems that we face now were later on in our life will make sense and when you remember that moment especially if you had overcome it you will know that you are thankful for that to happen because in the end you would learn something from it when you want something the whole universe conspires to help you  the alchemist categorized commonly as fiction selfdevelopment as well as philosophy by most readers did indeed give the feeling that it belongs to all these types and then some i believe however the meaning of the books is going to be entirely different from reader to reader depending on his or her personal philosophical religious social and traditional systems of belief  its true that most might interpret much similarly the parts on not giving up having unshaken faith and pursuing ones dreams amid numerous challenges but there are a quite a lot more in this book which could be interpreted in various ways the intangible connection shared by everything that is in existence certain implications that this is actually a ones journey to understanding universe or enlightenment the drastic differences in how a single situation is viewed and understood by different spectators are some of these differences  but in the end irrespective of your beliefs you will well enjoy this book that is most suited your own way of seeing the world  the story of one person is the story of everyone and one mans quest is the quest of all humanity  its the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary only wise men are able to understand them the moral of this story is absolutely intrinsic  i highly recommend reading this short novel and opening your eyes to more than just the world in front of you this is the kind of read that leaves you thinking well after youre done  written exceptionally well easy and comfortable read like soft blanket wrapped about you on a cold day by the fire it left me thinking silently for quite awhile after i closed the book paulo coelho is an interesting story teller and an incredibly versatile writer in the alchemist he has creatively explained the importance of following your dreams with the help of a story  the book is very well written equally well translated in english language the book keeps you intrigued interested and manages to inspire you with its message it is more of self help book but with the help of a fictional story the author has put forward his message point of view and notion of why it is necessary for all of us to keep following our dreams  the book in the end also features an interview of author paulo coelho in brief  thank you  this book is a miraculous piece of writing that created the kind of devoted fans that you find only to holy books i think simplicity has its way of getting into peoples mind definitely a mustread for everyone the author did a splendid job presenting the most overlooked sophisticated corners of lives through the lens of a wandering protagonist i have come across a few books engaging enough to hook you at the very beginning and keep reeling you in till the very end the book i would say caters to people with depression and lack of drive more than it inspires deep down i felt i was reading for entertainment and thats why it came off as complex to me because deep down the protagonist is a mary sue and thats why it caters to me because like a mary sue done well it tries to connect the reader who is apathetic or hopeless or depressed and tries to show them that maybe there is something out there just worth grasping for and yet i get a feeling that people who do grasp for the message in the alchemist will find that the book isnt deep at all and certainly many of the other reviews properly represent that  thats why i rated it as amazing its just one of those books that no one can really tell someone how bad it is until the reader actually finds out for himself and i doubt those who have read many books will find it astounding it all but not everyone reads a tons of books and for what its worth i think a book that can attach itself and inspire someone to read further deserves no less a rating than amazing  the alchemist is simply that kind of book that manages to do so by being short enough shallow enough deep enough and hyped enough to cater to a generation of casual readers i rarely reread books given the volume of books i want to read and my ever infinite tbr pile my favorite book of all time is the alchemist and i felt compelled to reread it earlier this year as its been several years since i read it and i was coming upon a time in the spring of  to revisit my own personal destiny  for this reread i listened to most of it via audiobook i loved the story just as much as the first time it was the motivating refreshing reminder i needed and a book ill continue to recommend  definitely we cannot write a quote like that of paulo coelho  this is most artistically written journey of life  there will be several instances which touch our soul this is a story about a young man santiago a shepherd who has dreams that sends him on a journey to find a treasure santiago meets many people and has many challenges in his travels he continuously develops and learns from these experiences  santiagos parents had wanted him to be a priest however while studying in school he realized that this was not what he wanted his father then gave him money to buy a flock of sheep since santiago thought being a shepherd was what he wanted this gave him the opportunity to travel around and meet other people and see other towns while traveling with his sheep he had the same dream twice santiagos dreams led him to a fortune teller which began his travels to foreign lands  the book had adventure fantasy inspiration and spirituality i think cultural background may have a significant impact on ones interpretation and understanding of this story i found the tone of the story very calming that was a beautiful book i am so happy that we read this at school the ending touched my heart and it was so different i am planning on rereading this soon its so good i loved the plot and the setting i recommend this to everyone this heartwarming adventure will bring a huge smile to your face  santiago is an andalusian shepard he kept dreaming the same dreams of where a person tells him to look for his treasure in the eygptian pyramids the whole book is about him learning different things and lessons and finding his treasure this treasure hunt adventure will keep you entertained  the story wasnt about the characters it was about this treasure and adventure i did like the characters but the story was mostly focused on this adventure and the treasure  this book was short and sweet and i finished it in  minutes it was a fast read for anyone who has an interest in dreams i recommend this to you its so good but now i have to go study for my test which is on this book anyway trust me the book is really good i finally got around to reading this so many people love it i just avoided it probably for that reason  but then as i was reading it enjoying the lyrical flow and the fact that it really is a fable i warmed up to it  you know the kind of story where that legendary treasure hunt is not an actual physical treasure selfdevelopment lol  i enjoyed it its very uplifting and motivational and underscores the fact that you should always follow your dreams no matter what  the fact that it was an interesting story that the novel was never dull or overly preachy except for the lessons that the fable was strong on only helped   it is slightly sappy tho   i mostly just enjoyed the juxtaposition of real alchemy and metaphysical alchemy the roadtrip aspect of the novel and the simple parable  when a book is as infamous as the alchemist people who miss why it is special and interpret it as too basic are no surprise simplicity does not at all lack depth base instincts and base emotions the core of who we are to the contrary equate profundity a singlethreaded fable is the hinge onto which authors hang important principals this is why the message of childrens stories are more complex than the adventure carrying them i put aside this novel a long time expecting uppity scholastics i was thrilled i could coast and soak up the nuggets that resonated with me  lets dispense with critical analysis and consider this few of us have careers in what we love doing best what our most natural talent is we dont dare take a pay cut in pursuit of it we dont want inlaws disapproving of us we accept the most lucrative jobs among those readily available and stick there for life im certain paulo coelho is addressing we who dream of writing who hesitate to believe we can be published authors  we permit roadblocks to overrule treasured hobbies too or the most sincere items on our personal wish lists because we think them costly or impractical i adopted a saying that i use whenever something i dream begins to look feasible i declare there will be bills whether i do something fun with the money or not lets create some bills were happy about none of that is new but it comes as a relief to see other people courageously asserting the same thing you believe a new thought for me is that the universe conspires to help us if we are true to ourselves and make a move i smiled throughout this whole book that says five stars to me i really really love this  instead of talking about the book im gonna talk about what i felt while reading the book  and im not sure if its because its almost that time of the month and im just an emotional mess or that this book is just what i need for my current state  this book talks about a young shepherd boy who goes on a journey and quest for treasure to realize his personal legend a dream in a quest for fulfilment and from there you can see how hes been through obstacles and hurdles but as he goes he learned to overcome his fear he learned to never lose hope and listened to what his heart desire  i also think its because this book took place in the middle east when he travelled so some of the values from the people the boy met hit close to home as a muslim myself it makes me think again of the things i should always be grateful more for and strive like i always intended  i saw that everything really was written there for me and that the doors had always been closed before because i hadnt realized that i was the one person in the world with the authority to open them   and that gives me a little strength to even start my proposal today   yay  there is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve the fear of failure   this book also talked about fear being a bigger obstacle than the obstacle itself and its exactly what im feeling the most now all my life i had expectations set upon me to fail is scary and the fact that i rarely experiencing it is what made it scarier to experience it again  but what this book told me  why do we have to listen to our hearts because wherever your heart is that is where youll find your treasure   why should i listen to my heart because you will never be able to keep quiet even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you it will always be there inside you repeating to you what youre thinking about life and about the world   and i know i needed this because what my heart wants right now is to feel capable again and just do things as i always do  tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself and that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams   i cried when i read this book and i still cried while writing this damn it its flooding in here i think its the hormone i was truly on a verge of breaking down lifes just hard dont you think but i also started to feel better whenever im feeling like giving up or in need of comfort i know i can find this book again    i believe im gonna regret writing this publicly while being an emotional mess but at least some part of me is lighter now and ill pursue my own personal legend as well this book felt like a tale i loved how the boy learned so much on his journey its definitely a read that inspires the ending was so sweet fantastic read i really think everyone should read this once in their life i would define it as a self help fiction book it reminds me of a tale a mother would tell her children to pass down to generations to help spread the power of the universe spirituality and the soul i found myself writing down powerful lessons every other page sometimes even multiple quotes from one page i really enjoyed and highly recommend when i first read this book i gave it four stars i read it over a year ago back in january  it was before i started grad school but after i finished undergrad so i was sort of in this nomans land headspace wondering what direction my life was going it was funny at the time i probably couldve related to santiagos journey the most yet i appreciated it the least now im not saying a guy from buffalo looking for a purpose in his city is the same level of journey as santiago but as time past this book has really stuck with me the tale of santiago following his dream from spain and through north africa using the journey to learn skills and become a better man only to discover the treasure was home the whole time really stuck with me the words of the alchemist explaining himself to why he sent santiago on his journey despite knowing the negatives really stuck with me and thats why i had to reevaluate my original four star review and change it to a five because this masterpiece deserves it  stars for the alchemist audiobook by paulo coelho translated by james noel smith read by jeremy irons  i think this was a charming and well written adventure im planning on listening to this story again because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny it whets your appetite with a taste of success  the old man  this is a classic that stays true to your heart once you have read it the alchemist advices you to live your moment fully and without any regrets to follow where your heart leads you and being brave enough to follow your dreams and learn about the soul of the world philosophy religion spirituality and omens take a huge part in this journey where you follow the maincharacter santiago who is a shepherd a new dream comes to life within him and a new journey will suraface when he takes on the path to find a treasure near the pyramids of egypt along his journey he also meets a gypsy woman a king a merchant an englishman and the alchemistand finally his soulmate fatima its beautiful and magical watching the whole adventure through santiagos eyes and experiencing everything with this optimistic young man i loved reading about the old ancient legends especially about the prophet joseph as i have grown up listening to his story and have watched many adaptions of it on tv this is a book i recommend to everyone small or big young or oldeveryone should read this book it teaches you so many things and blows your mind away with paulo coelhos unique and pure language i nearly got tears reading it because every word in this book is gold  the secret of happiness is to see all marvels of the world and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon  the wise man think whatever you want but sometimes well more often than not actually the most important message is the simplest one and the alchemist illustrates this to perfection lifechanging for some nauseainducing for others but far from leaving the reader indifferent this book is a powerful one and its ongoing success welldeserved  olivier delaye author of the sebasten of atlantis series from the ratings that i have seen it seems that you either love or hate this book there is no in between i happened to love it i felt like it spoke to things in me that i already know but had suppressed if you live your inner truth or follow your heartgut in this world you are thought of as strange when i trust my gut things go smooth when i donti can quickly feel the difference this book reconfirms to me that you need to be who you are no matter what is going on around you be in the world but not of the world im looking forward to reading more of mr coelhos books paulo coelho apparently wrote this story after he hit rock bottom in his career then went on a pilgrimage on the camino this incredible story of selfdiscovery and inner faith has inspired millions of readers the ending just had be awestruck how very true that our journeys often end at our beginnings ive read a few of his other books as well and am so impressed by his granting permission for anyone to reproduce his work in any way he truly is an inspiration and this book will always occupy a place of pride on my very cluttered bookshelf i have had this book on my list for a long time i absolutely loved it it is an easy to read book simple but with a profound message the plot is about an andalusian boy who goes on a journey to egypt in search of a treasure on a deeper level it is about lifes journey and following your heart i think this should be required reading for everyone
Crime and Punishment,i dont think blaming the translation would suffice there would be pages and pages of dialogue and then pages and pages of no dialogue at all and there was absolutely no flow important moments were often lost in deluge and the wonderful remarks of raskolnikov were always dulled down by the sheer tedium of what was happening around  i never fully felt immersed in the mental state of our doublemurderer either and no that isnt a spoiler i felt the incoherence and the frustration but it often felt quite superficial as if it was just a way to expound the other characters and their presence speaking of the other charactersaside from having about fifty names eachwere all a little lacklustre themselves i really enjoyed the idea but i thought execution was rather poor there seemed no fluid motion and whilst i think this did evoke and portray the mental state of our dear criminal i dont think it was done to the effect it could have been there should have been no other points of view first person would not have rectified that just a simple third person narrative with little or no omnipotence tried till the end but didnt sit well with me the man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin that is his punishment   you have no idea how much i wanted to love this book i was so excited to read it after watching that teded video titled why you should read crime and punishment unfortunately after getting through  pages i just cant continue this follows rodion raskolnikov as he plans and commits a murder of a selfish pawnbroker but suffers an emotional breakdown questioning morality though i found the premise interesting the and writing fairly easy to understand i decided not to continue  the writing and tone was what i wanted to keep going for i liked the dark tone and the times where raskolnikov goes crazy questioning morality etc unfortunately this wasnt always the main feature of the novel i found the conversations that the characters had to be just too long and tedious and not interesting for me to read so i kind of gave up if you want to read a book that explores morality and also has interesting dialogue i recommend the picture of dorian gray  other than this i watched a summary video to see if id want to keep going but apparently this gets weirdly religious and that is just not something id really want to get into and read about my stance is if it works for you great but dont push it into my face as the only way i can be a good person and that is the feeling i got from the summary of this book again i didnt read those segments so i cant exactly say anything specific  despite an interesting premise and legendary status crime and punishment simply bored me i started listening to this a couple of weeks ago as a talking book im about half way through and to be honest im struggling with it the problem is that i dont seem to care about any of the characters it might just be that im not in the right space for this book at the moment  but im giving up now perhaps in another life ill come back to it and see how the marmalade spreads  so to speak  but enough now  many consider crime and punishment to be one of the most influential books of all timeand i have to wonderhow the idiot although certainly flawed tells a far more cohesive and compelling narrative the central figure of crime and punishment is an angsty and hypocritical wanker i do not have to like a character to root for them but dostoyevsky man you gotta give me somethinganything instead we have this appealing main character who for reasons unknown to me manages to captivate everybodys attention  crime and punishment is divided in six parts in the first onewhich i actually kind of likedwe are introduced to rodion raskolnikov an impoverished young man who dropped out of university and is now forced to go to a pawnbroker for funds he believes that his financial circumstances are the only thing standing in the way of a good life so he decides to kill the pawnbroker telling himself that she is a callous old woman who sort of deserves to meet a violent end in this first part raskolnikov has various monologues in which he argues with himself a letter from his mother informing him that his sister is engaged to an older man of affluence he kind of looses it he also meets another tormented soul marmeladov an alcoholic neerdowell who basically tells raskolnikov his life story his incoherent ramblings go on for pages and pages and pages raskolnikov uses an axe to kill the pawnbroker but things predictably dont go quite as he had planned  the follow five parts havent all that much to do with this murder or with the detective who is pursuing raskolnikov after committing this crime raskolnikov falls ill he faints more often than harry potter and frodo combined lots of people try to help him but he remains an asshole razumkhin who was also forced to drop out of university due to his finances is utterly loyal to him andwhy even prior his madness it seems that raskolnikov was a noxious mix of moody and unpleasant then these two are joined by raskolnikovs sister and mother and by the two bad men who are interested in his sister and of course we also get some more of marmeladov and his family in particular his daughter a beautiful prostitute whose childlike appearance insert puking sounds here and inherent purity make raskolnikov besotted with her  everyone goes on a tirade no one makes any bloody sense ramblings here ramblings there ramblings every fucking where the dialogues are repetitive the plot makes no sense convenient coincidences aside it seems odd that raskolnikov would not think back to his article on extraordinary and ordinary criminals just once in part one or two given what he wanted to and what he ended up doing and i have  tolerance for grown ass men finding women attractive because they have childlike physiques temperaments or features and of course here we have women who tremble like leaves  there were so many over the top moments and whereas i found this fantastical realism amusing in the idiot here they just annoyed me raskolnikov is dumb he isnt a brilliant criminal or a genius or master manipulator or even charminghe just is he makes so many avoidable mistakes which made me wonder why it took the detective so long to finally confront him speaking of the deceive his scenes with raskolnikov had this very anime feel to them which works in parodies such as love is war and i could not for the life of me take them seriously  what kind of point was this book trying to make i have no clue i did not enjoy the discussions on extraordinary and ordinary men which seem to suggest that the reason why the detective is so in awe of raskolnikov is that he considers him to be an extraordinary individual one who should not be punished as hard as ordinary individual should yikes  to quote nabokov dostoyevskys sensitive murderers and soulful prostitutes are not to be endured for one momentby this reader anyway better in theory not in practice reading this was pain i did not enjoy it there is too much misery pain and suffering to enjoy this supposed classic sure times were tough back in the day that doesnt mean you have to stoop to the levels laid out in this tragedy  of  stars dont be angry with me all ye dostoyevsky fans  i couldve given this book  stars but unfortunately it has the following traits that i could not ignore  it got me yawning several times a star book could bore me at times but never induce a yawn  the story should be much much more concise so it would be more efficient i suppose  pages around half would have been great should have been a novella even as initially planned by dostoyevsky himself tuttut  the self rambling of raskolnikov is enough for anyone to tear hisher hair out hes absolutely my least favorite character in the book a wretched loser who didnt deserve any sympathy from me  the overlengthy soliloquymonologuedialogue is too much for my taste get to the effin point will ya or sowhats your point or geez this dude lost me at his third sentence are my most used expressions when reading this book  oh cmon silvana are you sure this book this socalled masterpiece classic worldrenowned critically acclaimed monumental writing yadda yadda yadda has no positive traits at all  well of course there are some well i think the first hundred of pages are quite enthralling dostoyevsky was good with weaving words and stuffs despite the lack of editing skill and ive read worse narration from other classical writers most of the characters were predictable stereotypes but as an ensemble theyre okay how about the philosophy was it that boring well not exactly some ideas of nihilism and stuff were quite enjoyable to read  i also think this book is still a mustread if youre curious enough about dostoyevsky andor russian literature ok so dostoyevsky tolstoy solzhenitsyn checked turgenev  chekov next i tried so hard to like this book instead i found myself barely able to appreciate it and i judge classics far less harshly than modern works as i believe there tends to be a reason theyve stood the test of time when it comes to crime and punishment i honestly dont see it there were no sympathetic characters pathetic definitely but sympathetic not in the least every single conversation is so emotionally overblown that it puts soap operas to shame im glad i can check it off of my list but id be lying if i didnt admit how relieved i am that its over  as always i enjoyed the experience of buddy reading with my wonderful book twin ts even if we didnt enjoy the book we chose this is a classic it has premeditated murder masquerading as mental illness actual mental illness a detective following a murder mystery abuse violence prostitution false confessions romance tragic deaths alcohol addiction and abject poverty so its got everything to make it a classic and yet and yet sigh  not only was this book a chore to get through but there were parts of it that seem to exclusively exist with the sole intention of using boredom to destroy the one functioning brain cell i have left  maybe such a classic story has been copied reimagined retold and recopied so often and in so many ways that i am now desensitized to its sheer force which must have been more apparent in the past maybe i am not educated enough to be able to empathise with the conditions in s russia or maybe its just better when read in original russian or the reason is an amalgam of all the above either way this was hard going and not enjoyable  makes me wonder whether if this book is given to an editor who has hold on to your knickers never heard of crime and punishment or dostoyevsky i know will they read this manuscript and declare it to be an amazing work easily among the greatest ever written my first attempt reading russian classic literature and i think i have a cause to consider more thoroughly any further forays into these books when i first related to my husband that i was reading crime and punishment his reaction was an incredulous why mind you he has read way more classics that i have so perhaps i should have taken his cautionary tone more seriously  in short crime and punishment didnt work for me as far as literary value is concerned id readily vouch that there were some great arguments and philosophy at play here however the delivery and execution of the story was too overwrought and overly dramatic despite all my efforts i did not enjoy reading this book  thankfully this was another one of my classics buddy read with my lovely book twin celeste which made the experience much better than if i were to read it myself i prefer tolstoy and kafka over dostoievski any time i mean is not even close to the emotions i felt in resurrection and the trial now i want to say that i share the same problem with the names in russian culture with tolstoy this was not a problem at all but with dostoievski it gets a little harder trying to keep alyona ivanovna katerina ivanovna and amalia ivanovna straight even more if i take into account that dostoievski treats his main character as a napolean god that gets away with insulting most of the characters in this history maybe that is why nietzsche liked him so much i cant relate to someone so mad and disgusting that keeps lying and pushing everyone around him yet he gets help and respect from everyone you can really tell the bias dostoievski had for his irrational character there is this scene that made me quit when the prostitute steals from luzhin i mean the fact that she gets away with it and that dostoievski praises his utterly irrational main character made me angry at least kafka respected his character k and we could relate to him because of the nonsense happening around him but with rodya i cant he disrespects everyone around him and the justification for the murder is a pitty one look tolstoy had these really nice long arguments and discussions between characters that respected each other with dostoyevsky you have this praise and bias for a character that doesnt even have a proper justification for his actions other than look i killed a worm not a human the devil made me do it i wanted to be like napoleon maybe i was looking for justice and atonement in the wrong place  finally as a psychologist this novel is overestimated and surrounded by so much hype honestly if you want to read a great atmosphere of misery and depravation look no further than charles dickens the readers digest condensed version  and he would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for that meddling detective i have read some amazing classics this year so i had no reason to think that crime and punishment wouldnt be another winner unfortunately i didnt anticipate what a drag it would be hours and hours of my life dedicated to exploring the mind of an insane person if only dostoyevsky could have done it in  pages it might have been tolerable sometimes it was oddly compelling but mostly i just wanted the punishment to end as far as the plot goes i never figured why raskolnikov committed the murders in the beginning i assumed that it was about money but as the book went on it was obviously that he didnt care about the money i suppose that he gave an explanation in his article but the arguments in the article didnt fit together with the circumstances of raskolnikov life his attempts to explain it to sonya sounded ridiculous except for the fact that he admitted that he was a little bad and a little crazy in the end the murders were senseless i have to assume that that was the point but it didnt sit well with me  sometimes if i dont like a book it is really that i just dont understand the book for a while i read a chapter analysis after each chapter i hoped that thoroughly understanding the book would help me appreciate it more i gave that up by part three about  through the chapter analyses werent adding much to comprehension of the book and it was prolonging the experience  im givingcrime and punishment two stars instead of one because dostoyevsky in some respects is an excellent writer i truly felt that i was inside the mind of a mad man  this book was a group read and it satisfied the requirements of my classics challenge  it either takes me half a day or half a year to read a book crime and punishment took me a lifetime no joke i spent ten months trying to get rid of this monster of a book  i cant say i didnt enjoyed some of it and i found quite interesting how it relates to raskolnikovs psychological side and his torment after the crime but after the first hundred pages i really struggled to get through it later on the story went way too slow and dragged on for too long  honestly the solely reason i kept reading was that i was determined to finish it  even in svetlana geiers translation this is still one of my least favorite dostojevskys oh well i am done i did it finally  this dragged on and on and on it was a reread but not a good one  when i read it the first time i liked it just fine but this time around i found raskolnikov unbearable  his mood swings his arrogance his hysterics his brutality i cant in any way identify with him as he is such an artificial character  but what really made this painful it was boring  its amazing as this book contains two gruesome murders two additional dramatic deaths accident and sickness resulting in three orphans one suicide one attempted blackmail and rape a broken engagement two couples falling in love and so on and so forth you might expect a lot of action but youd be wrong because there is a lot of monologues and long dialogues a lot of meandering talks not my type of book there was really nothing poignant in it and so the action swam in to much talk for my taste  the theme  raskolnikovs belief in his right to murder as he is special  was probably very original and controversial when it was written  i rate this low because i didnt enjoy it very much  not because i think it was a bad book it did have some more interesting parts but mostly i just tried to finish it as fast as possible and really what felt like  different russian names made it not really easy to follow the story  sometimes i had to go back pages to understand if the commissar was speaking or raskolnikovs friend or someone else altogether not sure if i really liked this book i will say that theres a lot of interesting discussion on morality and the theme of guilt is interesting to meditate on i quit this book because it was just too boring dont listen to those who say its an older psychological thriller i love psychological thrillers and this was just too boring finally though i know it was not a book to enjoy but one to appreciate im still not sure how anyone does that just seemed like a failed psychologist philosopher decided to write a book on those things but thinly veiled as a novel so much of the book contained minute detail about things i did not need to know then failed to give enough detail on things which i felt necessary not to mention he seemed intent on speaking in the extreme i mean everyone loved or hated each other there is apparently nothing inbetweeen i am fully aware that people and their thoughts are complex but i maintain that their are quite a few character inconsistencies also  many who praise this book to the highest degree claim that if you do not like it you just cannot comprehend its greatness maybe maybe i dont hold the same beliefs as the author or maybe it just wasnt my taste unfortunately i was not the biggest fan of this book the lack of actual things happening bored me and raskolnikovs inner psychological struggle and journey did for me nothing to lessen that it found raskolnikov to be a character very hard to sympathize with and i could not identify or recognize myself in him in any way  the thing i really did enjoy was dostoyevskys very realistic descriptions of the environment and its impact on human beings other than that i found the novel way too long and way too uneventful  with that said im happy with the fact that i have read this book and i hope that i will reread it sometime in the future hopefully i will be able to get more enjoyment out of it in a later point in life i had to read this book for my ap english class and it was so boring barely anything even happens in the book what is perhaps most frustrating about crime and punishment is that when its good its truly excellent these shining moments are regrettably few and far between  this is the first russian novel ive reached the end of deepest apologies to anna karenina so i must admit that any issues i have come from a complete lack of knowledge of russian literature regardless i think my issues are enough to turn this classic into in my eyes a bore  the first moment of this novel that i found myself viscerally reacting to was a dream that raskolnikov has before he murders alyona ivanovna and lizaveta in which a horse is beaten slowly and brutally to death its impossible to deny that dostoyevsky knows how to make you squirm in your seat another perfect moment was the confrontation between porfiry petrovitch and raskolnikov at the police station where you finally understand the game of cat and mouse going on between them and maybe my favourite part of the novel raskolnikov revealing to sonya that he is the murderer and that he didnt do it for a justifiable reason but merely to see if he was the sort of historically great man who could there were a handful of other moments that gave this novel the potential to be great but theyre drowning in paragraph after paragraph of raskolnikovs increasingly dull and repetitive internal monologue  many characters feel unrealistic to the point of pantomime with mood swings of laughter to tears in the characters who arent even meant to be in mental decline for instance avdotya romanovnas confrontation with svidrigailov starts with her attempting to shoot him and him attempting to assault her and ends with both of them letting one another go for no obvious reason for a novel which is meant to look into human nature this felt ridiculous  i can see why so many people call this their favourite novel but for me it was far too dense and tedious to find it enjoyable it would take a lot to make me revisit this novel i just couldnt get along with this classic im obviously not great when it comes to russian names as still during the last hour of listening i maybe knew who  people were but i wouldnt be able to tell you their names now probably because i listened to it rather than read it i was immensely bored throughout once the double murder happened i thought it would start to heat up i was wrong it just rambled on and on and i just couldnt understand or get along with the main character or his way of thinking the narration was the best thing i dont really know what i was expecting but it certainly wasnt this i felt like the mc did the crime and we took the punishment maybe that was fyodors goal i did it i can tick it off my list there wont be a reread sorry to those of you that loved the book this is just my thoughts and feelings i was looped into this book quickly but after the initial event the murders i quickly got bored with the chase i feel like  of this book could have been eliminated it just went on and on with side trails that were unimportant i dont believe raskolnikov was redeemable i felt no sympathy for his character have you ever been hyped for a movie and then when you see it find that the movie is just average but you know if there hadnt been that hype you might have had a better opinion exact same thing here  crime and punishment has been heralded as a classic praised and assigned as necessarily reading i question however the title of classic that has been given to this book because to be a classic i think it should be also good the fact is the only reason its been given the title is because its old there is little a person can get from this book other than an insight into prestalin russia and the mindset of its people  most of the book consists of characters over verbalizing and ranting about this and that making it feel more like platform for half realized philosophy the same kind of philosophy thats developed by youthful ignorance the other half of the book is filled with descriptions of people fainting trembling and having fits while im no expert on historical psychology i feel like all these frenzies were a dramatization that made the novel untrue to reality somewhere deep in paragraphs of diatribe from the main character i thought i was reading a poorly written play watching raskolnikov pace the stage talking moaning out loud about his thoughts so as to keep the story moving  and i know that its uneducated of me to complain about but i found the fact that every character had multiple names distracting despite knowing that its a culture matter of translation  in the end that i had been duped crime and punishment was less about punishment and poor about the criminal activities of the poor and unfortunate dostoyevsky may have attempted to compare the morality of humans and their crimes but only succeeded in revealing his own person beliefs that in this day and age look petty self centered and lacking integrity ive been tackeling the bbc big read top  for about a year now and found some wonderfull classics  and new favorites  because of it ofcourse this book was on the list and i was sure i would love it because a its a classic b it has a dispicable main character which is my favorite kind of protagonist c it contains death and misery am i weird for liking that in a book  unfortunatly i did not enjoy it as much as i thought i would not because i did not understand it since i did study this book and read analyses afterwards to get the full message no i was just bored reading this i loved the first  pages or so and i was suprised how easy this book was to read but later on it was just sooo slow i would have liked it better if it was shorter also all these russian names are super confusing some characters have  different names in the book and there are even characters with the same last name  for me it started really well but it dragged on for too long to keep me interested so i guess im the only weirdo who doesnt like this book it didnt seem to have a point to me i get that it was showing the depravity of man but there are other books that do it way better in a much shorter amount of time almost the whole book was stream of consciousnessif i ever see moreill lose my mind the ending was also disappointing the girl redeemed his life not jesus ok anna karenina is a much much better book i personally dont like being in the mind of a murderer thanks  moral of the story guilt will cause a person to turn themselves in even if he escapes the suspicion of everyone around him
The Help,here is an illustrative tale of what it was like to be a black maid during the civil rights movement of the s in racially conflicted mississippi there is such deep history in the blackwhite relationship and this story beautifully shows the complex spectrum not only the hate abuse mistrust but the love attachment dependence  stockett includes this quote by howell raines in her personal except at the end of the novel there is no trickier subject for a writer from the south than that of affection between a black person and a white one in the unequal world of segregation for the dishonesty upon which a society is founded makes every emotion suspect makes it impossible to know whether what flowed between two people was honest feeling or pity or pragmatism an eloquent way to describe stocketts intentions for this novel i know most reviews will probably focus on the racial relationships in the book but to me the most haunting statement was that when you are paying someone to care for you and their livelihood depends on making you happy you cant expect an honest relationship  i did not expect this book to hit so close to home after all i did not grow up in the south and completely missed the racial mind shift in the country but the book isnt just about racism and civil rights its about the employer relationship too and i did grow up in south america with a maid trying to keep herself out of poverty by making our crazy family happy as much as we loved her i can see so many of the pitfalls from these complex relationships in my own history i know our maid was stuck between pleasing my mother and raising us the way she believed appropriate i know it was physically hard to work from sunup to late everyday and emotionally hard to never relax because she wasnt the decision maker of our home and at any moment she could be reprimanded for making the wrong decision she had absolutely no power and yet she was all powerful to shape and mold us  i needed her felt bad for how much i imposed upon her but i never voiced how much i appreciated or loved her i took her for granted even though she was paid to love us i know she did we were her children especially my youngest brothers and yet when she moved back home we lost contact was it out of laziness of our own narcissistic lives or was the complexity of our relationship so draining she cut the tie it is my fear that she thinks we did not return her affection and only thought of her as the maid i often think about her we all reminisce about her wondering where she is and more than anything i just want to know that she is happy and tell her thank you it is so strange that someone who is such a vital part of your childhood can just vanish out of your life they say its like true love good help you only get one in a lifetime i know believe me i know  the story is strong and real and touched something deep inside me i could so relate to the motherly love from constantine to skeeter see that pain in the triangle between aibileen and mae mobley and elizabeth feel the exasperation of minny toward celia and understand the complexity of the good and bad the love and hate the fear and security stockett captured all these emotions  i also loved the writing style when style compliments plot i get giddy i dont always love grammatically incorrect prose or books about an author trying to be published but here it works because its honest the novel is about a white woman secretly compiling true accounts of black maidsand the novel is in essence a white author trying to understand black maids the styles parallel each other as do the messages the point of skeeters novel is to make people see that people are just people no matter the color of their skin and stocketts novel beautifully portrays that with both good and bad on both sides the fictional novel cover is decorated with the white dove of love and understanding to get us there stockett gives us three ordinary birds a picture of ordinary life asking to be accepted for its honest simplicity  this book is stocketts masterpiece that story in her that was just itching to get out from the first page the voice of the characters took vivid form and became real breathing people i loved aibileen but think i loved minnys voice more because she is such a strong character besides the maids i loved hilly as a portrayal of the white southern belle with the ingrained belief that black people are not as good as whites verbalized as separate but equal so it doesnt sound racist my favorite scene was when hilly says they have to be careful of racists because they are out there shes a bit over the top but if youve been to the south not that far of a stretch i just would have liked to find some redeeming qualities in her from skeeters perspective  while there are some instances where i felt stockett was squeezing historical facts into the novel forming the plot around these events instead of letting them play backdrop and occasionally i could read the modern woman in this tale pushing her message too hard stocketts sincerity to understand and appreciate shines through she lived this book to some extent and the story is a part of her because its important to her it becomes important to me ok wow wipes away tears  the help is a fictional story set in mississippi in  the perspective shifts between three characters two black maids aibileen and minnie and a young white woman nicknamed skeeter will these women be able to change the status quo and what will it cost them  first of all the audiobook is phenomenal with a full cast of characters it is definitely on my list of top  best audiobooks of all time second this book made me laugh and cry it has a very conversational tone similar to project hail mary but with no science and women instead of men when the story rang out across my living room i felt fully immersed in the story just like aibileen was sitting on the edge of my couch sharing her story this was one of those books where you hoped that it wouldnt come to an end  the characters are unforgettable complex and imperfect this book was incredibly fascinating because the stakes were so high for the maids at any time if their employers were unhappy for any reason they could be fired not only would they be unemployed but no one would hire them with a bad reference especially in a small town however i think the title the help is has more than one meaning  the plot was intricately woven together and it felt realistic at the end i googled is the help based on a true story apparently this question is quite common based on my google research the author was sued by her brothers maid ablene cooper for using her likeness  this book tackles meaningful issues such as racial injustice rejection and being on the outside of a clique fear but it also covered love hope bravery and children the future it was really a very beautiful book and i am grateful for reading it this will be a strong contender for book of the year  i know what a froat is and how to fix it  aibileen clark knows how to cure childhood illnesses and how to help a young aspiring writer write a regular householdhints column for the local paper but shes struggling mightily to deal with grief over the death of her something son and she sure doesnt think conditions will ever improve for africanamerican domesticengineering servants in earlys jackson mississippi or anywhere else in the south  aibileens good friend minny has been a maid since she was very young and on the first day of her first job her mother admonished her that sassmouth especially her degree of it is highly dangerousbut its not long before shes just gotta mouth offand look for another job as minnys first episode of the book opens she is yet again looking for a new job and this time an opportunity pretty much falls into her lap celia foote needs a domestic engineer but she also needs a friend a real ally even a confidante oh one more thing she needs to keep minny a secret at least for a while i think this plotline was my favorite part celias husband had formerly gone with even been engaged to somebody else did any of you wonder how they would have gotten along if he had married her instead of celia  but really which is the worse attack from minny a good sassmouthin or a good slice of her extraspecial chocolate revenge pie enthusiasm  this book and i almost never met and that would have been tragic the fault is mostly mine  i mean the book made no secret of its existence  a billion weeks on the best seller list every third customer asking for it at work displays and reviews and people on here praising it to the heavens it practically spread its legs for me but i just kept walking i figured it was something for the ladies like sex and the city which i dont have to have ever seen an episode of to know that its not something i would enjoy i figured that this book was on the ladder one rung above chick lit so i am to blame for my snobbish dismissiveness but have you seen this cover what is with that sickroom color scheme and i hate those stupid little birds what is chip kidd so busy doing that he cant just pop over here and lend a hand it is not my fault for thinking it was a crappy book when that cover wanted me to think it is a crappy book  but this book is good really really good again i thank you readers advisory class for fixing me up with this book it has been a long time since i have read such a frankly entertaining book if a book about the emotionallycharged early days of the civil rights movement can be called entertaining this is just an effortlessly told story split between three different women whose voices and perspectives never run together  the secondary characters are also completely believable and are all different brands of repellent with some token sympathetic characters tossed in for the halibut i dont even know what to say i just feel all aw shucks i loved this book about it  there were several times i would catch myself grinning at a turn of phrase or a situation and every time i would start to doubt myself that maybe i would like sex and the city or buffy the vampire slayer or all these things i have formerly judged without having readseeneaten maybe i am like these white women in the book taking their help for granted and assuming they have nothing to say to each other because of their unwillingness to talk to them and know them as human beings maybe buffy and i have so much to learn from one another  then i would snap out of it and remember that my gut opinions are  foolproof  so for you other people who need to be swayed by hype  i give you hype this books hype is merited  it would be a perfect book to read this summer when you are melting from the sun and need a good story this is a very tender and loving book about hope and sisterhood and opportunity but also about beatings and terror and shame  still hate those birds though one of my coworkers a guy who isnt much of a reader borrowed the help from the library based on his english professors recommendation the guy just couldnt stop talking about the story so i decided to borrow the audio book its not very often i get to discuss books with people in real life and i wasnt going to let this opportunity slip by audio books are good for me i was so engrossed in the story and characters that i drove the speed limit on the highway and took the scenic route while running errands sometimes i went out at lunch and needlessly drove in circles or sat in the parking lot at work waiting for a good place to stop  it is  in jackson mississippi twentytwo yearold eugenia skeeter phelan has returned home after graduating college to find that constantine her familys maid and the woman who raised her has mysteriously disappeared aibileen is a black maid in her s who works for the leefolt family and cares deeply for their daughter mae mobley she is still grieving for her young son who died in a workplace accident minny is aibileens closest friend and a wonderful cook but her mouth keeps getting her into trouble and no one wants to hire her until aibileen helps secure her a position with celia foote a young woman who is new in town and unaware of minnys reputation  the story jumps back and forth between the three characters all of them providing their version of life in the south the dinner parties the fundraising events the social and racial boundaries family relationships friendships working relationships poverty hardship violence and fear skeeters mother wants her to find a nice man and get married but shes more interested in changing the world her plans to anonymously compile a candid collection of stories about the maids jobs and the people they work for will risk her social standing in town her friendships and the lives of the maids who tell their stories  i loved this story the characters really came alive for me and the author did a good job acknowledging actual historical events which lent richness and authenticity to the story i laughed and cried felt despair and hope this is an important story that is a painful reminder of past cruelty and injustice it shows how far we have progressed and how much more we still have to accomplish an amazing book that looks at the relationships between african american housemaids and their white female employers in the early s in the town jackson in mississippi the book is written by a white woman from mississippi a book that made me cry with anger with sorrow but aslo with wonder and laughter a fantastic work from first time published author kathryn stockett a book that is not as full of anger and pain as it could have been and in my opinion it is exactly that that makes it such an original and enjoyable read  out of   five star read this is an amazing and moving novel so much so that tasks appointments and everything else in my life were put on hold while i read laughed cried celebrated hurt and felt healed some friends once told me about a spiritual teacher who would often say there is magic in the telling the truth in those words vibrates throughout this brilliantly conceived and executed novel  the author herself talks about the risk of a white woman telling the stories of black women living in an era of slow transition between overt undisguised racism and a more covert and secretive racism yet many white people of that time did not recognize racism for what it was the structure of society was simply their everyday life as long as the black people needed the jobs offered by white society they would be subject to obeying every command swallowing frustration anger and their own pride  and usually for much less than minimum wage the consequences of not swallowing were just too dangerous  this novel a book about writing a book about the domestic service of black women in early s mississippi is a finely balanced ontheedge story  like a tightrope walker dozens of feet above niagara falls one slip one false step and the entire premise would collapse into the water  instead there is a rare and precious authenticity to these stories that are thematically pulled together by skeeter  the white woman determined to write the book and aibileen  the black domestic worker employed by one of skeeters friends and then there is minny rebellious full of anger intelligent wise and good  how she was able to cope with a home life filled with conflict and carry on working fulltime besides is beyond me  my admiration for so many of these characters started small and continued to build throughout the novel their lives their experiences their authenticity and humanity touched my soul i will always be grateful to this beautifully crafted novel for opening my eyes and my heart to a larger perspective there is a lot to like about this book it is easy to be drawn in by the storyline and the characters and its a pretty fast read its a historical timeperiod ive been really interested and i thought the portrayal of the events and the relationships were pretty accurately done  the characters are really well done  theyre all pretty different and easy to tell apart and theyre all so likable in their own real sometimes prickly ways  and i was impressed by the fairly evenhandedness of the topic that stockett managed she didnt make one group out to be saints or one group demons there are good and bad and goodishbaddish people on every side of the issue and each has different motivations and reasons for being where they are on that side  hate pride naivete personal experiences three reasons why i love the help  its funny it is not a comedy but some lines just had me wanting to read on and on it is easy to read even though the help talks about a very serious time in american history the author really thought about how to write the story in a way that it just flows i really felt a connection with each of the characters you get to know them from their point of view even though the story is through miss skeeters mindset for most of the novel stockett provides insight into the brain and life of both minny and aibileen  kathryn stockett has created this wonderful story that depicts life in americas south during the early s a mix of humour and social justice the reader is faced with a powerful piece on which to ponder while remaining highly entertained in jackson mississippi the years leading up to the civil rights movement presented a time where colour was a strong dividing line between classes black women spent much of their time serving as hired help and raising young white children while their mommas were playing society lady as best they could eugenia skeeter phelan may have been part of the clique born with a silver spoon in her mouth but she held herself on the periphery at times looking in skeeter was unwed and with few prospects though her time away at college left her ready to tackle the workforce until an eligible man swept her off her feet skeeter returned to jackson only to find her familys help left under mysterious circumstances and no one was willing to discuss it skeeter sought a job as a writer prepared to begin at the bottom rung but not giving up on sleuthing around to determine what might have been going on in jackson skeeter scored a job writing an informative column in the local newspaper giving cleaning tips to housewives in need of a little guidance who better to offer these tips that the hired help of jackson skeeter fostered a slow friendship with one while building up a trust and has an idea for a book that could offer a unique perspective in mississippis divided society skeeter sought to write a tellall from the perspective of the hired help in hopes of shining a light on the ongoing domestic slavery taking place within a freed america with secret meetings taking place after working hours and skeeter typing away a mental shift took place and the idea of class became taboo at least to some full of confessions and struggles in mississippi society skeeters book may just tear the fabric of what has been a clearly demarcated community since after the civil war however sometimes a book has unforeseen consequences turning the tables on everyone and forcing tough decisions to be made stockett pulls no punches in the presentation fanning the flames of racial and class divisions as she depicts a way of thinking that was not only accepted but completely sanctioned a mustread for anyone ready to face some of the treatment undertaken in the name of societal norms stockett tells it like it was and perhaps even still is  race relations in the united states has long been an issue written about both in literature and pieces of nonfiction how a country as prosperous as america could still sanction the mistreatment of a large portion of its citizens a century after fighting a war on the issue remains completely baffling while stockett focusses her attention on mississippi the conscious reader will understand that this sort of treatment was far from isolated to the state one might venture to say that racism continued on a worldwide scale creating a stir while many played the role of ostriches and denied anything was going on the characters within the book presented a wonderful mix of society dames and household help each with their own issues that were extremely important the characters bring stereotypes to life in an effort to fuel a raging fire while offering dichotomous perspectives the interactions between the various characters worked perfectly depicting each group as isolated and yet fully integrated the household help bring the struggle of the double work day triple at times while the society dames grasp to keep mississippi from turning too quickly towards integration and equality which they feel will be the end of all normalcy using various narrative perspectives the characters become multidimensional additionally peppering the dialogue with colloquial phraseology pulls the story to a new level of reality one that is lost in strict textbook presentation stockett pushes the narrative into those uncomfortable places the reader hopes to keep locked in the pages of history pushing the story to the forefront and requiring a synthesising of ideas and emotions this discomfort is the only way the reader will see where things were likely in a hope not to repeat some of historys worst moments in americas development however even fifty years after the books setting there remains a pall of colour and class division promulgating on city streets while racism is not as sanctioned in as many laws it remains a strong odour and one that cannot simply be washed away by speaking a few words this book as entertaining as it is in sections is far from fictional in its depiction of the world the sooner the reader comes to see that the faster change can occur all lives matter if we put in the effort and have the presence of mind to listen rather than rule from our own ivory towers  kudos madam stockett for this wonderful piece i am happy to have completed a buddy read on this subject and return to read what was a wonderful cinematic presentation this is a historical fiction book about what it is like being a black woman in the south in the s this book follows a black maid mainly as a white woman that grow up in the south i know things like this happen but it makes me very sad this is a great book that i did not want it to end because i wanted to keep reading about these characters i could not put it down i love this book so much i listen to this book on audiobook and the audiobook was so great i also watch the movie base off this book and it was also very good i think if you like historical fiction book you should read this book  this is a book that delivers on several levels it is an entertaining and engrossing novel with drama humour and sadness but it also causes us to reflect on deeply moral and racial issues while racism has existed for a long time and continues to unfold the story provides a snapshot into a time that is fascinating and how historically it manifested itself into society in the us its a story of how servants or maids show more integrity and moral compass than their employers its a story of life and communities how we love and hate how we laugh and cry how we interact with family friends and those we work withfor  the narrative in the help places the perspective from a white journalist miss skeeter and two black maids aibileen and minny miss skeeter wants to write a book using the insights both aibileen and minny as to what its like to be a maid and how they are treated this causes major concerns of trust if they are to be open and truthful as minny says i cant believe aibileen wants to tell miss skeeter the truth truth it feels cool like water washing over my stickyhot body cooling a heat thats been burning me up all my life truth i say inside my head again just for that feeling  each character is very well developed with more than just a superficial front and they show depth to the many aspects of their lives there are other books that cover slavery segregation and racism in the us many are more sensational and brutal in their coverage of black subjugation however this book leads us to those issues in a less graphic manner for a more mainstream international audience the stories and insights in themselves are inspiring and understanding the paradox where someone like aibileen can be trusted to raise white children but watched suspiciously in case she steals material items is bizarre how maids must remain upbeat and pleasant regardless of the way theyre treated or what may be happening within their own families and personal lives to hold the quality of someones life as a weapon is corrupt and repulsive but to do it on a systemic scale is completely abhorrent  the help is a very clever book perhaps meant for more global audiences as it provides an entertaining story whilst delivering these deep ethical issues i highly recommend this book so it looks like the help is turning out to be one of those novels that i love despite flaws nearly everyone in the world knows what this book is about as i pen this review it is at  in amazon sales ranking but i shall reiterate its the story of three women  two black one white  in s jackson mississippi and how the two black maids work with the one extremely naive white young woman to write a book of their stories as the help  in the spirit of honesty i should tell you that i didnt want to read it it sounded like it was going to hit the maggie trifecta of doom   fiction that is good for you  womens fiction now with  more tears  mint julep references  i have not been thrilled by a single novel that mentions a mint julep im not sure if this is coincidence  however i loved it despite the fact that the book is massive  pick it up next time you go by its a doorstop  i read it in three evenings it was engrossing very well characterized and often funny strangely enough two of those are also part of what i consider its flaws the characters are so reliably themselves that they are nearly caricatures in some areas while it meant i could definitely never mistake one womans voice for another it also gave it a bit of a hollywood sitcom feel they were types instead of people and the funny  well race relations in s mississippi is not exactly all fun and mint juleps as everyone knows but this book is upbeat uplifting and ultimately made a bit fluffy by all its humor and optimism again i could imagine this as a hollywood screenplay in a new york minute  still dont get me wrong  its wonderfully written and easy to love and very easy to recommend i also think it would be a killer book club book because there is a lot to talk about in here and i dont just mean the trifecta of doom bits i think that everyone who reads it will at least like it even if it will not become their absolute favorite in the world and we need books like that so go out and read it  wondering why all my reviews are five stars because im only reviewing my favorite books  not every book i read consider a novels presence on my goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement i cant believe i just said hearty it sounds like a stew i done finished this book finally  i aint never seen a book like this lately it were not too long before i seen something in me had changed reading it  may be a seed was immediately planted inside a me  after finish it i seen a small baby in street she very much like mae mobley leefolt when i see her she laugh dance a little happy jig i touch her cheeks she smile again then i go to work but find her dancing again weaving her hand  gush gush gush gush gush i cannot gush enough about this book  the help by kathryn stockett follows the lives of three women living in  jackson mississippi two of the women aibilene and minny are black hired as help to wealthy or trying to appear wealthy white families eugenia or skeeter as she is called is a white woman recently graduated from ole miss university and trying to become a writer she is what probably most of us are kindly ignorant of the world around her raised on what her mother embarrassingly still refers to as a plantation she lived in an environment with all the privilege and prejudice youd expect from a southern belle living at home again skeeter doesnt quite fit in anymore among her friends who are all married with children  when a feminist editor from new york rejects one of skeeters submissions she includes with that rejection the advice for skeeter to write about what disturbs her it is while playing bridge with her friends and she becomes aware of her friend miss hillys crusade for every home to have a separate bathroom installed for the help to contain the germs blacks carry that whites are more susceptible to that skeeter realizes she has found her subject matter  skeeter is the least developed character of the three but she is the means in which this uniquely uplifting story can be told without skeeter who at  finally and lonesomely comes of age the help would simply be another shocking look at the racial inequality that existed still so recently in the south it is skeeters character and her ambition to write a book that matters that strips aibilenes and minnys blatantly mistreated funny and irresistible characters out of their perfectly pressed maid uniforms and into each of our lives  i dont want to give away too much about abilene and minny who became women i loved they mattered to me aibilene especially is so vividly written that her voice her mannerisms her unguarded moments took solid form in my imagination more than anything i wanted her to thrive to triumph  as rich as this book is in both characterization and plot its real accomplishment is that it encouraged me to examine my own prejudices racism has always been a frustrating topic for me to think about as has sexism my mind has a hard time wrapping around the idea that there was a time when educated people  enlightened people  sincerely believed that any race or gender was superior to another it seems our spirits must have always had the capacity for understanding that this could not be so but the help showed me how such beliefs are possible  stockett a southern white woman herself exposes this possibility with an experienced sympathy using a variety of characters she demonstrates how many southerners in this particular chapter of our nations history werent racist because they were meanspirited or elitists but because tradition and bogus science had supported their belief foolish traditions yes but they were able to be easily convinced that a separate toilet was not only desirable but necessary because they lacked scientific understanding about germs and contamination and genetics they only thing available to counter such painfully offensive actions was personal reflection and perhaps their consciences  more so and what was really eye opening to me were the attitudes of the help and how their own actions and attitudes were also heavily influenced by tradition and fear  as much so as their white counterparts whites with control and power dosed out injustice after injustice that was defended by their fear and blacks adjusted to the degradation based on their own learning and fear minny was taught by her mother how to behave as a maid in the home of a white woman  what to say and do and how to say and do it she also experienced first hand the consequences of breaking with that tradition being fired and blacklisted and unable to provide for her family the difference between what excuses the fear as loathsome or imaginable was the availability of recourse blacks had none or very little  i must believe as a human being that there is something inside each of us that witnesses the value of our souls however blacks then had even less access to understanding and knowledge than their white peers which left them with little other than their own consciences as proof of their worth how frustrating to be human whose freedom is limited by the understanding of others it made me wonder which of us are like miss skeeter miss hilly aibilene or minny are we currently kindly ignorant arrogantly holding all the answers quietly giving the best of ourselves with what society allows or protecting our vulnerability with a tough outer shell  perhaps we are all of them at different times of our lives progressing at our individual rates of enlightenment and courage as skeeter explained wasnt that the point of the book for women to realize we are just two people not that much separates us not nearly as much as id thought you is kind you is smart you is important  beautifully written and incredibly moving with laugh out loud moments just the book for the times that are in it  this was chosen for a buddy challe
The Secret Garden,i guess i didnt miss much by not reading this book as a child i dont really understand why it became a classic it starts out interestingly enough with a very gothic setting a little british girl named mary survives a cholera epidemic in india and is sent to yorkshire to live with her distant relatives the author gives a vivid description of the beauty of the moors and the mysterious mansion that the girl goes to live in the only other interesting part is really when mary discovers the boy who she hears crying in the mansion and when she discovers the secret garden everything else beyond that which is most of the book isnt all that interesting the author spends many pages explaining how miraculous and magic fresh air is for healing and fattening up the crying boy and the girl who escaped the cholera epidemic in india  the bits that get old after a while oh look its a garden look i can run and play im not a cripple after all look at the pretty birds the garden is alive now i have an appetite isnt it a magical miracle that im having fun playing outside  i just wasnt really impressed this is a childrens classic book i love the story this review is hard to write because i love the story the characters in this book and the plot of this book but i did not love the audiobook the narrator of the audiobook was good but my big problem with this audiobook is all the sound effects and music in the audiobook there is times in the audiobook you cannot hear the narrator because of the music or sound effects i think the audiobook could be so much better without the music all together and less sound effects or the sound effects be lower i was kindly provided an eaudiobook of this book by the publisher harper audio or author frances hodgson burnett via netgalley in exchange for an honest review about how i feel about this book and i want to send a big thank you to them for that ok i must have read and loved this book  or so years ago yikes i liked it a lot this time round but it was troubling to me in several ways it starts off as the story of mary a girl suffering from epic neglect her entire household in colonial india parents servants everyone die from cholera or flee the house with noone bothering to think about her leaving her alone not knowing whats happening if anyone is there scavenging for food from unfinished meals on the table hows that for a brutal opening of a childrens novel the description of her neglect is so clear and strong that one cannot help but feel that the author must feel some sympathy for her character but amazingly she dwells on her unpleasantness to such an extent that one cant be sure she isnt censuring her strongly  well it starts off as marys story and one is prepared for the coming alive she is going to experience when the damn thing gets hijacked by colin a little boy at her uncles house in yorkshire where she is sent who is her male counterpart his mother dead at or near his birth shunned by his selfabsorbed father loathed by the army of nurses and doctors over whom he rules tyrannically by virtue of their desire to prevent his tantrums  well its hijacked by colin but its hijacked again right at the very end by colins father whose own unpleasantness though less obvious than colins and marys is certainly more culpable in that his began in adulthood and led him simply to forget the existence of his son but happily through marys work on colin and colins own working of what he calls magic the paterfamilias and his male heir are finally restored to happiness mary entirely forgotten  and theres dickon the young peasant boy who is the symbol of the healing powers of nature he absolves the function of the magic negro here an oppressed outsider by virtue of class here not race whose wisdom and power is harnessed by and makes his and his familys poverty somehow less awful to the ruling class his fate after the novel was almost certainly to be killed in the trenches of flanders probably as colins batman colins right to order everyone around dickon mary the old gardener ben weatherstaff the doctor is never questioned  and the magic obviously theres a lot of good sense in burnetts views about health and happiness  nature care for animals and plants eating well fresh air and exercise but theres a newagey selfhelp side to it that gets a bit nauseous repeating over and over to yourself yes i can having one good thought a day etc etc the secret garden is an enjoyable book i listened to the audiobook and enjoyed glenda jacksons narration mary is lonely and then finds a secret garden the secret garden is an interesting story it is a classic story but i didnt know anything about it before reading this version  thank you netgalley and william collinsharper audio for the secret garden straight off the bat im going to say that there were several incredibly racist remarks made at the start of this book mainly from maid martha it made me very uncomfortable and i wouldnt give this book to my children to read id rather watch the  film  aside from that which thankfully didnt continue throughout the later stages of the story although its never addressed either i actually really liked the themes of nurturing and rebirth mary lennox is not a likeable child shes spoilt and cruel and starved of love however through her love of a little robin and a forgotten garden she learns to appreciate life and all that it has to offer the dawn of spring brings with it flowers baby animals and hope for the future with vivid depictions of the garden and wildlife that help bring the story to life the parallels between mary and colin were nicely explored too and their relationship brings out the best in each other dickon will forever be my favourite character though his boundless love of animals and the moor were infectious and integral to marys growth  id be hesitant to recommend this knowing that there are so many amazing childrens books out there these days that are wonderfully diverse and just generally better however if youre looking for a nostalgic read this is very true to the  film and brought back quite a few fond memories this was my favourite book for several years as a sensitive intense child the evocation of the moor the transformation of the boy dickon into a mythical figure and the mysterious garden were so powerful to me i experienced them with a passionate intensity that transported me completely when i travelled on the bus to whitby years later and realised that i was looking at real yorkshire moors and had actually seen them many times in my life i was once again in awe of frances hodgson burnetts power of description that she could give this rather desolate unvarying landscape such magnetism i havent broken the spell by rereading i did not read this classic as a child it might have made a different impact if i had the description of the yorkshire moors are beautiful and the children while unpleasant at the beginning become rather adorable as the story progress while i quite enjoyed the story and the theme i am disturbed by the way the then colonized india is represented in this book multiple characters here are racist which might have been the way people were at that time but i would not like children to imbibe that today i for one oppose critical remarks of grownups on childrens books however i cant help noticing the sly innuendos made in this book about mary becoming black and viewing yellowskin as something vile this being a childrens book i appreciate the authors idea of nurturing thinkpositive naturewalk and such ideas but little did the author know the weeds she had been unconsciously sowing in this garden in no way this is an allegation but a mere remark or an observation though unpopular i also understand that human race as it is is continuously learning and evolving and i hold nothing against this book or the author mind you for i think this behavior as malice of the time and ignorance of the age  just a thought as hard it is to correct the blunders of the history cant we at least correct this kind of mistakes in the literature especially childrens so that children of today can enjoy something with good vibes only ive heard a lot about this for years  finally worked up the mood to listen to it i was both delighted  horrified as a gardener i love the idea of children working for the beauty  wonders that a garden can bring  as a parent wtf as the s had dr spock  his softheaded ideas the s had stanley hall who was at the opposite end of the spectrum parents shouldnt coddle children with emotion  touch but should have them reared rationally by professionals if at all possible this lack led to a child fever with the rich suffering worse than the poor as they withered away in sterile beds without the comfort of parental love again wtf i wouldnt believe people could be so heartless  stupid if i didnt see all the idiotic fads that sweep child rearing today  this is the story of two such children  its plain insert expletives horrifying that a parent could be so selfish  self absorbed is beyond reason that others played along is repugnant if it wasnt for the some common sense  uncommonly good country folk the sowerbys plus a lot of luck these children would have been lost horrible to even contemplate  i can see where a kid would take the best parts of this story  not think on the rest thankfully in that case its a fairly good story it sags a bit at the  mark but picks up into a rousing ending well narrated definitely not on my reread list but im glad i got through it once this book is definitely better than i expected it to be although it took me a very long time to finish since it doesnt have much romance but it was enjoyable to read about mary and how she made friends and family i also really like the message this book gives and it also shows how a person should always look on the bright side  another good point about this book is that there werent hated characters at all mary colin and dickin were cute and adventurous i dont partially hate any character or love any either so i decided to rate it three stars since it was an ok book the secret garden was a wonderful chance to look back as i read this story i recognized that if i had come across it when i was six or eight or maybe even  i would have likely loved it i would have felt i gained entrance to a magical world where wonderful things happened and kids were in control manipulating the adults around them the way it should be as it was i read this at a different point in life and with different expectations as a reader it was just all too much the story was unrealistic the prose was glowingly upbeat but i think the real problem was simply a lack of depth there are books and movies that are crafted to attract and entertain multiple audiences child and adult alike for me there was nothing here for the adult as an adult i quickly became bored i think i would have enjoyed this more if i had read it to one of my kids and could have watched and enjoyed their reaction if i were a kid i mightve been swooped by this book but as an adult with a conscious mind as much as i like flowers and nature still i couldnt ignore the racial overtones racism and discrimination against then indian subcontinent whether it was the result of authors ignorance or prejudice its hard to argue in either case it was offensive thus explains this book to be sometimes found on banned book lists  postcolonial theory could be applied to this book and its key terms ambivalence alterity orientalism and many more stand true against this book hence my generous  stars as this book is good for postcolonialism and its case study but not a childrens book i could recommend  one of the many instances is the following which comes from martha portrayed as a sensible empathetic character  it is different in india said mistress mary disdainfully she could scarcely stand this but martha was not at all crushed eh i can see its different she answered almost sympathetically i dare say its because theres such a lot o blacks there instead o respectable white people this story about how two children who managed to be both spoiled and neglected healed each other with the aid of a secret garden is something of a classic i came across it in primary school and eventually got round to finding out if what i remembered as good really was it is  fairly good anyway it becomes somewhat repetative in the latter half and the plot is entirely predictable from early on its also a bit over the top regarding the transformative power of nature and gardens in fact as often seems to be the case with victorian novels it is probably best read at no more than a chapter a day this of course was how it was read to me in school back when i was ten i wonder in books such as this and a tree grows in brooklyn where the author is relying heavily on personal experience whether nostalgia makes childhood poverty look happier than it really was but there is no way of knowing  ive never read fhbs other famous work little lord fauntleroy and i cant say im likely to seek it out but i would not avoid it either the secret garden is an ode to life itself  spring yellow and green the writing was like fresh pinescented air  green purple shadow and silver encompassing both winter and spring i wish i were verbal enough to describe all the visuals that span the canvas of my mind it is all delight fresh cold air gurgling little streams and laughter the whole world smiles at you my favourite character was dickon  the common moor boy the animal charmer the magic boy i wish i could speak robin  wendell berrys the peace of wild things was a poem i thought of constantly and i cannot think of one that fits this book better  when despair for the world grows in me and i wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my childrens lives may be i go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds i come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief i come into the presence of still water and i feel above me the dayblind stars waiting with their light for a time i rest in the grace of the world and am free this was a decent story i read it when i was a child myself and incredibly in love with all the descriptions of nature in this book i still liked them and it was nice to revisit the story i liked seeing the characters develop from spoiled children to who they became by the end of the book i liked that they still had some of the qualities and personality of their former self after that transformation often the transition from spoiled to kind results in an abrupt uphauling of character but that wasnt the case here  i really liked the friendship between the two main characters too however the ableism in this disability narrative troubled me a lot i also wasnt the biggest fan of some elements to their happily ever after especially when it comes to the fatherson relationship and the ableist messages it sends and the unaddressed racism i enjoyed this book and i can see why it became a classic but the writing was too simplistic for my taste and the characters very straight forward and even bland and i guess i expected more from such a popular childrens classic i can see why this book gained so much popularity it was a fascinating story for children with a redemption story it has an exciting element of secrets and making things that look dead come alive burnett did a wonderful job of parallelling the growth of the children and the garden  i had trouble enjoying it for two major reasons  the first i will freely admit is because of some things ive faced in recent years the idea that is provided in books and movies that yelling and telling someone how wrong they are causing them to change is simply a myth usually when you get two selfish people in a room yelling you just have a very loud room and end up with two people angrier than before love gentleness and kindness are what transform people im not saying that firm rebukes are never the answer but the firm rebukes should come out of love not selfishness if they are going to change people  having been on the receiving end of harsh words by people out to show me what a rotten person i am with no love or forgiveness i guess im sensitive to this type of story  as is usual with burnett her use of people believing in magic while rather innocent at times is bothersome in this book at one point the children are talking about magic and god and a woman who is shown as one of the wisest in the story says it doesnt really matter what you call it magic or god i was very bothered by this idea  basically this was a wellwritten book but one i dont recommend nor enjoyed if you look the right way you can see that the whole world is a garden  what a cute book i can see why its a classic it talks about death illnesses war surviving and growing all from a childs point of view its also full of very strong feelings feelings of abandonment anger fear and hope  i really enjoyed the audiobook with all the character voices with different accents when i was a child i liked the secret garden but i could never understand why it was so much more famous than a little princess by the same author which always seemed the far superior book in terms of story i thought age might solve the mystery but it hasnt  the first half of the book is admittedly excellent wonderful pacing plausibly disagreeable characters ripe for reinvention the twin appeals of a secret garden and yorkshires answer to the god pan young dickon the animal charmer and crying in the night and the discovery of colin and the magic of growing things  if only it quit while it was ahead the later chapters are a bit like being forced to attend a spiritual retreat a lot of chanting and magic many lectures on fresh air and exercise as a cure for all ills two sickenly perfect mother figures mindnumbing accounts of what everyone ate and treacly sentimentality ive seen the spring now and im going to see the summer im going to see everything grow here im going to grow here myself  first thing first this edition is to die for the cover and its colours the gold details the endpapers the goldsplayed edges this book is a piece of art  this was an easy charming and heartwarming read but i just hated the characters they were just too spoiled and dramatic i appreciated their development but there was still something that just didnt click with me regarding the characters  funnily enough while reading this book i had a wordsworths quote stuck in my head nature never did betray the heart that loved her and i just think that it represents this book perfectly  and the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new miracles its so bad that i only have just known about this novel very soon id like it to be a part of my childhoods memories lust like everybody else i love how it shows how we need trust and love to do whatever we want that happened to colin craven when everybody told him that he wasnt fine and he believed till he made himself not well for real but when he met mary she gave him love and trust she kept telling him that he is normal and he can do walk he believed her and believed in himself as well till he made it i also like the fact that the secret garden was a motivation for everyone to start a new life  wish i can find my own secret garden that will help me to reach what i want too this is a lovely book worthy of the many times its been read and reread since publication my favorite part was the way burnett captures the thrill of watching a garden grow the kids were privileged but good at heart and its themes of inclusion the harm of gossip and choosing life are universal now to introduce it to my littlest reader granddaughters mary and colin are two materially spoilt but severely emotionally neglected children who abuse their carers and always get what they want through friendship and nature they both learn how to be kind enjoy life and work hard to achieve a goal  the way this book describes nature is beautiful and highly immersive i also loved to see how the children changed and grew overtime which felt more realistic and fleshed out than i expected and dickon i absolutely adored him  i have to admit i was surprised at the blatantly racist and ableist remarks made by several characters including the adults i guess i thought this would be more progressive because of the glowing reviews calling this book wholesome and lovely with no mention of bigotry even if it was normal at the time of writingpublication and the overall theme of kindness and emotional growth but alas i picked this up at my volunteerjob at the library because it occurred to me that i have never in my memory read this book now its possible i did read it but forgot about it because my memory is a bigfatlyingliar sometimes but i asked my mom and she said she also didnt remember it being around mostly because she didnt like the story herself so she never encouraged us to read it i didnt understand what that could possibly mean since everyone else seems to adore this book  i read it anyway just to see the problem is im reading it for the first time at  instead of say  i appreciate the moral of the story but the execution at this stage was a bit hard to wade through i found the children frustrating all in their own ways which i guess is sort of realistic because i tend to find most children frustrating in the real world too the story felt repetitive because again im an adult reading a childrens book and it was hard to fully engage in the story at this stage the magic doesnt always work all the time on us old timers i guess even though the lesson here is we all have the magic inside of us though i think after reading this the magic refers to bipolar disorder so maybe we dont all have the magic inside of us  im not sorry i read this book at all its enjoyable and sweet but ugh a little too sweet for me at times i am sorry i didnt read it as a child when i think it would have had more of an impact on me but its pretty much the story that i expected based on what little i knew about it and thats all  as far as why my mom didnt like the story im not sure i havent asked i would say she probably didnt like the following details which ill hide in a spoiler tag in case there are others like me who have never read the book  the racism and poor representation of nonwhiteenglish cultures the fact that little mary was completely forgotten in the beginning when everyone was fucking dying the way everyone is really pretty hateful and negative and yelly theres a lot of yelling and mean towards each other even though everyone comes around in the end and theres a lovefest the yelly parts are really most realistic and that would have likely bothered her a lot the saccharinity good lord there are tame animals and lots of shouting about the magic the magic if youre bad everything sucks including you but if you change your tune your life will get better again understanding this is a kids book but as an adult reader that doesnt do it for me life is more complex than that and so are people  in any case i really adored this beginning paragraph to chapter  it hits me in the feels one of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live for ever and ever and ever one knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawntime and goes out and stands alone and throws ones head far back and looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the east almost makes one cry out and ones heart stands still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun  which has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years one knows it then for a moment or so and one knows it sometimes when one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly again and again something one cannot quite hear however much one tries then sometimes the immense quiet of the darkblue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure and sometimes a sound of faroff music makes it true and sometimes a look in someones eyes  that could have been the book without any other words and i would have been much much happier heard this as an audiobook  having said that im happy that i did since it made it easier to get through marys annoying tantrums reading them wouldve stuck me deeper into her mood through it all the story just made me think of how easier life would be if we worked together saw each other as equals and maintained those relationships until they bloomed a small girl has been mostly ignored by adults and been allowed to do whatever she wants this has made her generally listless spoiled and grumpy the remedy for this is clear she must continue to be mostly ignored by adults and allowed to do whatever she wants but this time in yorkshire  along the way invalids will be cured by the power of positive thinking and nature and one  recitation of the doxology yorkshire locals will be sensible and charming and downtoearth and never go to school and be hale and hearty despite not having nearly enough money to feed their families one  ghost will appear briefly in austria and the descriptions of springtime will be absolutely glorious im not sure if i quite liked this but the ending was cute i suppose its a beautiful book to read during spring  its basically a book that is all about loving nature and how good it is for everyone  no matter who you are or where you come from to spend a lot of time outside  which honestly i kind of love especially with the really nice and sightly too romanticised descriptions of nature and how it grows and changes throughout the seasons  the writing is a mixture of yorkshire accent which honestly i could do without personally but its also something that gives the book something different and slightly unique to it that other classics do not have and beautiful writing  the characters are an interesting mixture of lovable and i want to shake that child to finally get over it and just get a move on dear god type of characters which is as strange as it is nice  its just a nice mixture of happy ending and everything is well at the end and realistic struggles that makes the book a nice read  overall its not really anything special or so uniquely fantastic that is a must read in my option but if you are someone that loves nature love spending time outside or are one of those with the option that children really do need to move and run around outside to have an actual good childhood like i am because honestly how could a child not spend at least half of their childhood running around outside in some form this book is a lovely read  if you are someone that does not really care about nature descriptions need loveable characters and hate annoying children or childish behaviour this book will drive you absolutely mad  personally for me i loved the nature bits i enjoyed the mary parts but i didnt really love the colin sections for a number of reasons not a huge fan of the magical healing stuff that are so often used in especially childrens classics but overall its a gerat message in my option and just overall a great and enjoyable read for spring to get excited about spending time outside when the weather is finally getting nicer again  so all in all its a nice read that i am sure i will come back to in a number of years when i forgot most of the story yet again since honestly its not that memorable overall even if its enjoyable to read if that made any sense at all
Memoirs of a Geisha,so memoirs of a geisha id been wanting to read that one for a very long time i had heard so many good things about it its supposed to be awesome and deep and beautiful right wrong its not memoirs of a geisha is an american novel and as such the attempt at west does east especially on the complex and delicate subject of the geisha is compelling interesting but also heavyhanded and ultimately ineffective even more so in the case of the film it is a wonderful introduction to geisha japanese culture and the east for the uninitiated western reader and i can see why the book is popular but i found it disappointing for the reader already familiar with the culture western influences are all too clear and the book comes off as a bit clunky and imperfect i also had some problems with the general perception of the characters by readers versus the way the characters were actually portrayed in the bookmemoirs is far from the goodwilled fairy tale that people assume it is by all means read it but leave it open for critique and remember that a more authentic representation of eastern culture especially in the details will come from the east itself  a lot of my critique stems from the fact that this movie has attained such widespread fame and been made into a movie to be sure i feel like it is being perpetuated as something it is not even the introduction to the book a faux translators note perpetuates the myth that memoirs is an accurate beautiful indepth reflection of the life of a geisha when in truth it is no more that historical fiction and is written by an outsider golden has done his research and is welleducated on his subjects and i have no problem with people reading from taking interest in and even learning from this book i do however think it is important that readers dont conflate the american novel with japanese reality they arent the same thing no matter how much research golden did and if we take the book as an accurate representation were actually underestimating and undervaluing geisha japan and japanese culture  because golden attempts to write from within the geisha culture as a japanese woman he must do more than report the facts of that lifehe must also pretend to be a part of it pretend he does acting out a role as if he has studied inflection script and motivation he certainly knows what makes writing japanese but his attempt to mimic it is not entirely successful the emphasis on elements the independent sentences the visual details are too prevalent and too obvious as if golden is trying to call our attention to them and thus to the japanese style of the text he does manage to draw attention but to me at least what i came away with was the sense that golden was an american trying really hard to sound japanesethat is the effect betrayed the attempt and the obvious attempt ruined the sincerity of the novel for me i felt like i was being smacked over the head with beauty wood water kimono haiku and i felt insulted and disappointed  the problems that i saw in the text were certainly secondary to the purpose of the text to entertain to introduce western readers to japanese culture and to sell books and eventually a film they may not be obvious to all readers and they arent so sever that the book isnt worth reading i just think readers need to keep in mind that what golden writes is fiction historical fiction yes but still fiction therefore we should look for a true representation of japanese culture within japanese culture itself and take memoirs with a grain of salt  i also had problems with the rushed end of the book the belief that sayuri is a honest good modest generous person when she really acts for herself and at harm to others throughout much of the book the perpetuation of hatsumomo as unjustified and cruel when she has all the reason in the world and in general the public belief that memoirs is some sort of fairy tale when in fact it is heavyhanded biased and takes a biased or unrelatistic view toward situations characters and love however all of those complains are secondary in my view to the major complain above and should be come obvious to the reader  memoirs goes quickly is compelling and makes a good read and i dont want to sound too unreasonably harsh on it however i believe the book has a lot of faults that arent widely acknowledged and i think we as readers need to keep them in mind this is an imperfect western book and while it may be a fun or good book it is not japanese authentic or entirely well done arthur goldens memoirs of a geisha is set in japan from the great depression through just after world war ii a young girl named chiyo moves from her small town in yoroido to the big city to become a geisha however chiyo misses her family and an older geisha is determined to destroy her one day a man notices chiyo crying in the streets inspiring chiyo to become sayuri a remarkable geisha will sayuri have a happy ending  memoirs of a geisha is this months may readalong and i have mixed feelings about this book first the pace is really slow usually this is a detriment but it is perfect for reading this over a month and having indepth discussions  the most enjoyable part of the book is the gamesmanship between the warring geisha mameha and sayuri against hatsumomo mameha knows how to perfectly extract herself from situations gracefully and she is a true chess player always thinking a few steps ahead  i also enjoyed learning more about geisha the women are entertainers skilled in conversation singing dancing and playing a musical instrument called the samisen there are also certain hairstyles and clothing indicating different stages in the life of a geisha  now for the bad  memoirs of a geisha has one of the most disappointing endings it doesnt even make sense and for dragging on for ages the ending is extremely rushed  at the end of the book i have more questions than when i started each of the geisha could have had their own book and i felt that some of the characters were left a bit unfinished such as sayuris sister  and for the really bad  i wanted to know if memoirs of a geisha was based on a true story in the acknowledgements arthur golden thanks mineko iwasaki who is a real geisha however iwasaki spoke to golden on the condition of anonymity she alleges that the book is her lifes story except that golden falsely sexualized the book two years later an outofcourt settlement was reached  overall this book is great for discussion but it made me feel sick thank to everyone who participated in the readalong see you in june for little women  very entertaining but kind of made me gag everything was written in this fauxasian my heart ached like cherry blossom petals floating on the river bullshit this started so well but then it got more and more boring with each chapter  i was hooked on this as soon as i started reading i found myself storming through it and totally invested in the story then somewhere around halfway through i found myself growing terribly bored my reading rate slowed down it started to feel like a chore and it took me almost five months to finish it  what happened  the story seemed to stagnate and the descriptions felt very similar and reused moreover it didnt seem to be going anywhere other than the obvious direction granted it picked up towards the but by then i had lost interest and wanted the book to be over it seems rather trite in a book review to complain about the length of a book but im going to do it anyway this felt too long i have no problem with big books if they need to be big this one felt padded out and like parts needed to be stripped back and the writing made tighter it waffled on and i grew tired of it  it was slow so painfully slow  im disappointed because i feel like i should have loved this one and i thought i was going to i wish i had something more positive to say but i cant find anything else i enjoyed about it it had a good hook but thats it consider me very unimpressed what a disappointment why is it that in most books reviews only the marginal niche fans vote massively upholstering the average score so unfairly unless it is the romantics who do read diversely that in their unbiased way gave the book four to five stars even people who gave the book the same score as me must have done so for different reasons maybe the ending threw them maybe ill never know im left scratching my head as to why this book is considered the best historical fiction on this site  ill pool all my misgivings from the last third of the book in this paragraph chiyos outlook towards life is delusional and is vindicated by her being united with her beau i wonder what friends i myself would have had my life been more successful chiyos memories of her past are very selective sometimes she wants to be a geisha but anyway she has no choice her heart breaks and reseals itself over her journey in becoming one her infatuation with the chairman and her laughable dressing of her repulsion to nobu sums up the genre of romance the book is an ungodly mess in its themes the analogies and lessonlike counsel that passed for wisdom at the end made it all clear this books just an escapist dream for delusional romantics of all genders and ages my reason for my score is mainly that at not one point did the book reel me in i was never hooked  i have to consider hatsumomo most of the books main archenemy she is described as stupid but reveals herself as cunning the latter attribute is proved beyond doubt but her stupidity abetted by drunkenness only comes at the end this was a missed opportunity to dress up a promising character when hatsumomo mars a kimono belonging to her rival its almost an act of vandalism but we are never allowed to get the insight whether the act itself has the fuel of  meanness and  stupidity or the other way round or some other permutation  i first intended to write more than im doing but i want to put this book behind me quickly i want to make two points which is more than my favorite team can make at the moment first i knew that such a dishonest and cowardly book would make of the tragic pumpkin a mean spirited person i knew it her separation from chiyo should have been temporary instead she estranges herself from joy and purpose in life in the most random way she is very wimpy in her decision to join the dark side its just not that convincing maybe her scavenging act early on foreshadows what the author did with her its not an excuse though second thing the stupid and bizarre episode between chiyo and the baron it should have had consequences but it seemed like the mother of all treaties had been signed between all parties very inexplicable inexplicable but quite welcome its an occurrence that made me distance myself from the narrator i dont have to be concerned with her when she troubled trouble  this book were it a flawed masterpiece and dealt with a genre i detest would still have gotten more than two stars but at no point did memoirs reach a pinnacle or peak of sorts no event was reciprocal there was no theme except from a rags to riches story nature sometimes was described richly but new objects of unfamiliarity and technology were glossed over which is cool as were all aware of modern contrivances its just that everything ive mentioned makes the narrator fake its just sad it means ill never read this book again neither it nor i deserve it people were skeptical when kathryn stockett wrote in the voice of two black women in the help arthur golden took it to another level when he a white middleaged man narrated as an orphaned japanese girl on her way to becoming a geisha  it worked though even without knowledge of goldens extensive experience studying japanese culture and history the reader is led to believe that the protagonist is telling the story herself memoirs of a geisha transported me to a different era where superficiality and beauty were more important traits for a women than practicality and intelligence  i enjoyed the writing style golden utilized with this book especially the analogies here are two i marked  for its one thing to find your secrets suddenly exposed but when your own foolishness has exposed them well if i was prepared to curse anyone it was myself a shopkeeper who leaves his window open can hardly be angry at the rainstorm for ruining his wares  her skin was waxylooking and her features puffy or perhaps i was only seeing her that way a tree may look as beautiful as ever but when you notice the insects infecting it and the tips of the branches that are brown from disease even the trunk seems to lose some of its magnificence  a great read  i am so thankful for my friend who bought me this as a birthday present recommended to anyone remotely interested in japanese culture or the life of a geisha the book in itself presents an interesting story and makes for an entertaining read but what bothers me about this book is that the vast majority of western readers interpret it as a historically accurate memoir when in fact it was written by an american author for an american audience and therefore has achieved its success through appealing to and reinforcing the stereotypes about japanese culture in america another reviewer on this website writes it is a wonderful introduction to japanese culture illustrating how many western readers including countless personal friends interpret the lifestyle and culture depicted in memoirs of a geisha as absolute historical fact  in the tradition of ruth benedicts the chrysanthemum and the sword golden presents japan and japanese culture as exotic and strange reinforcing the major theses of the nihonjinron which literally means theories about the japanese genre  when looking at everpopular images of a lone white man in a crowded tokyo street many westerners see the surrounding japanese as identical to one another and inherently different from that white man and his native culture a belief that goldens novel only serves to perpetuate what disappoints me the most is that golden holds a degree in japanese history and still the inaccuracies and stereotypes that he was raised with win out over historical fact in his writing in conclusion golden presents an interesting story in memoirs of a geisha that should only be read if the reader is prepared to believe none of it  there are two distinct schools of thought about this famous novel one says its pageturningly brilliant and the other says its pernicious nonsense and dull to boot naturally being very grumpy i am of the second school of thought sophias review from  perfectly sums up all the problems  whereas many people in their enthusiastically describe this as compelling i thought it was really not compelling i was uncompelled i was like a river that came up against a dam and that dam was the remaining  pages of memoirs of a geisha golden earns points for creativity but loses them for inaccuracy  the memoir of the elegant sayuri whose life as a highclass geisha is disrupted by the outbreak of war is written in an intriguing and alluring monologue  purportedly narrated by sayuri herself to the author  that pulls the reader in from the very beginning unfortunately the real narrator arthur golden took some dramatic liberties with history and cultural practices and the fallacious elements sprinkled throughout detract from a potentially fascinating story this may not present a major issue to a reader who has no prior knowledge of japanese culture but such a reader should also be warned not to take this book as a factual representation of life in japan  additionally although the narrative starts strong it loses momentum partway through the story by the time the inevitable tremors of world war ii began to shake the cultural bedrock of japan i was already beginning to lose interest in the artificial suspense  overall the book is written fairly well and i can see why some readers would like it but even while i was reading i couldnt help feeling that i should have enjoyed it more well it fell way short of the blurb which likened the heroine to jane eyre or scarlett ohara not quite i found it a mildly entertaining read although a little dull not a lot happened and i did occasionally wonder what on earth the movie must have been like i was not sure whether the author really knew what he was writing about  pretty sure there were some westernised views in there and a few stereotypes i intended to give this three stars when i started this review but i seem to have talked myself down to two oh well you know i feel bad giving the book  stars i am sure the author did a very hard job researching this stuff and all and the writing sure wasnt bad the narrative style and the simplicity of the book were okay but every moment i have spent reading this book has annoyed me so sorry arthur golden  stars it is  sayuri the titular geisha the ohso charming girl the narrator was damn irritating there is a literal bombardment of similes one simple statement which can be expressed just as simply has to be explained by comparing it to the hills or the sunset or the breeze blowing by or the river flowing by you get the point it felt very pretentious to me not a river really more like an ocean with its waves continuously crashing on the shore destroying the sand castles of peace of mind oooops i caught the sayuri syndrome also major problem chairman my dearest chairman what does sayuri see in you i totally dont get it to devote ones life to a man like him eeks he has set new standards of edwardishness check out the ending of the book you will know what i mean that is not the way to treat a girl as if she was a kind of birthday present nobu is just behind the chairman in the irritating character list he is the biggest hypocrite in the book actually because he pretends to not to be a hypocrite in fact the only honest characters in the book were mother hatsumomo and pumpkin they were bitches and they knew it  i dont want to criticize this book so much and would like to stop here but i wasted my money on this book and it has made me regret it so revenge time the climax absolutely royally sucked one doesnt just suffer from all that sayuri went through and live happily ever after this isnt a disney princess tale its a tale of a geisha and as mameha puts it one doesnt become a geisha for fun they do because they have no choice the author absolutely ruined the book with the unrealistic ending and no it doesnt end here there is more the book totally contradicts itself it chants through out that a geisha is an artist not a prostitute but sayuris virginity is literally auctioned of whats more this book is freaking historically inaccurate i did some research and it turns out mizuage was supposed to be more of a sweet  party a change of hairstyle thing and the geisha who was interviewed for this book even told the author so so the changing of fact to make the story juicy was really slimy  still i guess many people might like it so i am not really going to advice people against itso what if i said all the things above read at your own risk it might change your life and you may end up thinking that this is the japanese form of titanicsob awwww sob and chairman is the dream come true memoirs of geisha was quite an interesting read but it was only after finishing it that i learnt about the authors apparent misdeeds according to mineko iwasaki this book is riddled with errors and is quite offensive in its descriptions of a geisha going through mizuage mrs iwasaki gave an extensive interview to the author while he carrying out his research for the book but after reading his work she brought legal action against him with allegations of confidentiality breech and a damage to her reputation for this reason i had to ditch my original  stars i honestly dont know how to word my thoughts on this book  its like nothing ive read before  which was my very reason for picking it up i knew nothing of geishas before starting this book so of course i found out a whole host of new things while reading this i found it fascinating to see the difference in cultures especially in such detail  but this is a work of fiction and i dont know anywhere near enough about the topic to know whats actually true or false theres been a whole host of controversy surrounding this book with it looked down upon for revealing things about geisha practices when they themselves are very secretive in their ways not only that but even if this was a close following of a geishas life with only a few changes to make it fiction  its still just one persons point of view and so it could be bias in a number of ways im aware there are a number of books i could read to broaden my understanding  but im reviewing this book not those  it will never be my place to claim this as a reliable telling or not just clearing that up  that being said i still found it interesting as mentioned before i was intrigued to know more especially with the level of detail  and yet in a weird turn of eventsthe level of detail went from being amazing to being this books downfall for me it just dragged on way too long i started getting bored halfway through the book and come the end i justskimmed the pages and i feel awful because everyone claims it to be this absolutely amazing book worth all the awards and whatnot but i just lost interest it cant be helped  it also didnt help that i started finding it hard to read many of the things geisha are taught in this book i couldnt agree with its a cultural difference so i dont want to argue against it or anything but i just found it hard to read certain scenes at times  so for me this book just wasnt a hit which is a shame but ah well how honest and true a picture can an american man paint on the world of a geisha not much in my opinion true until the second world war starts the books a pretty nice window into that hidden world as much as goldens resources allowed him to know but beyond that this book becomes another piece of american romantic kitsch trash as everything the main character ever wanted becomes reality and she moves to the mighty and wonderful america to the country who flattened two of her nations cities with atomic bombs reading and learning a little about the japanese on my own i tend to think shed have too much pride to do something like that written in an ok style not a work of art thats for sure i dont recommend this book unless sticky romance novels are your taste memoirs of a geisha written by arthur golden and published in  by alfred a knopf the novel went on to become a runaway bestseller and remained there for more than a year it also spawned an awardwinning film adaptation in  starring zhang ziyi crouching tiger hidden dragon  and michelle yeoh star trek discovery as mameha despite their accolades there were valid reasons for controversy both mediums in fact were equally scorned and celebrated albeit for different reasons the novel was predominantly questionable due to mineko iwasakis gr link claims that goldens portrayal of her character was grossly inaccurate the result was a commonly known lawsuit against the author and the aforementioned publisher for character defamation breach of contract and copyright violation the film adaptation directed by rob marshall of chicago fame was criticized for casting chinese actors in lieu of japanese performers  needless to say its easy to recognize its merits as well as its flaws a quarter of a century after its initial publication the novel is still largely divisive at the same time though id like to think the average reader would be willing to take a chance with it to look past the controversies and acknowledge that mistakes happen given goldens academic accomplishments majoring in japanese history and art from harvard and columbia university i dont believe there was any malicious intent involved i genuinely dont i think that as with any book mistakes are inevitable now should he have confirmed beyond a doubt that he understood the exact nature of iwasakis character and her circumstances definitely but should it be continually criticized as harshly as it is despite the outcome of the lawsuit and the time lapsed since initial publication no i dont think it should  but i gleaned almost all that information in hindsight going in i knew that the narrative revolved around a nine year old japanese girl named chiyo who would eventually become one of japans most successful geishas what exactly is a geisha though and how do you define success according to the back cover we enter a world where appearances are paramount where a girls virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men and where love is scorned as illusion  i wasnt privy to any other details i often question whether or not i wouldve read it if id known what i was getting myself into the answer is yes why because it completely took me out of my comfort zone and because it challenged me in many many ways i was not emotionally prepared to enter this extremely slowburning esoteric lifestyle how can you even prepare to be immersed in what was essentially a secret society one in which only the very select few were chosen fewer yet were as renowned as the woman who would be known as sayuri nitta the truth is you cant i couldnt anyway entering this vastly different and unique experience any other way would be tantamount to viewing the film prior to reading the novel   in our little fishing village of yoroido i lived in what i called a tipsy house it stood near a cliff where the wind off the ocean was always blowing as a child it seemed to me as if the ocean had caught a terrible cold because it was always wheezing and there would be spells when it let out a huge sneezewhich is to say there was a burst of wind with a tremendous spray i decided our tiny house must have been offended by the ocean sneezing in its face from time to time and took to leaning back because it wanted to get out of the way probably it would have collapsed if my father hadnt cut a timber from a wrecked fishing boat to prop up the eaves which made the house look like a tipsy old man leaning on his crutch   as the title suggests memoirs of a geisha is sayuris story using her specific vernacular talking about things otherwise forbidden and taboo that worked exceptionally well because golden allowed his protagonist to be vulnerable open to the unknown and thus free of the shackles that society wouldve ordinarily placed on women golden permitted the reader unfettered access to her ambitions her thought processes and the often mundane ins and outs of the geisha lifestyle in consistently stunning prose the author meticulously illustrated the novels primary setting kyoto and juxtaposed the past with the horrors of what was to come world war ii in turn he shone a light on the enormous impact it had on japan the aftermath was felt by everyone even those perceived very successful a year or two or even six months prior to their involvement in the war circa september  its repercussions essentially changed everything ones occupation their station in life economic status wealth poverty and the countrys mental health in general and maybe that sounds dull or boring to some readers but it pulled me in that much further golden has a way with wordsthat much is certain but where the typical writers prose tends to come across as textbook or pompous once again he allowed sayuri to show us her personal experiences in ways which came natural to her those insights were dependable not just during the second half of the th century but throughout the novel and they were never superfluous on the contrary those details went a long way in demystifying japanese culture and the geisha specifically for instance geishas are not prostitutes there were some that chose to sleep with their male clientele undoubtedly however that was the exception not the social expectation  and while sayuri was nicely developed and we got to know her father enough to at least sympathize with many of the other characters lacked significant substance i never felt that i knew them on more than a superficial level its true that hatsumomo made a good villain and her influence on the adorable pumpkin were heartshattering but the former in particular was very onesided i wanted to know more about her childhood and her interests did she have any hobbies as a kid did she always live in the gion district who were her parents what were they like what was the source of her insecurities and vitriol and then there were the men they were the source of one of my biggest issues with the book without saying too much almost every man was hyperfocused on sex the author colored them in a rather unforgiving and uncaring light and thats simply not reality you cant convince me that sayuri viewed most men that way when she was shown kindness and respect by them on many occasions and why would she believe that nobu was kind when he actually wasnt  i had to wonder if men were so blinded by beauty that they would feel privileged to live their lives with an actual demon so long as it was a beautiful demon   the first half was terrific my infatuation with it couldnt be sated the latter half though was something else i think the narrative flow suffered a bit after the abrupt departure of one of its antagonists said exit was disappointing mostly because it felt uncharacteristic though i was relieved not to have to read about her antics afterward it almost felt like the author didnt know where he wanted to take the story and that showed time and again through sayuris increasingly childish decisions in addition the backhalf gradually became boring repetitive and a challenge to get through i literally had to force myself to finish it in other words the end did notin any wayjustify the means i was extremely let down with the decidedly anticlimactic conclusion and frankly i was furious not because he gave her what i can only describe as a cinderella style ending but because it was unrealistic where was the authenticity i think he was motivated by the fact that happy endings are vastly more popular than a sad one and he wanted a product more likely to sell i hate to be cynical but thats my honest opinion of his motivations  one afternoon during world war ii some years after these events im telling you about now an officer took his pistol out of its holster during a party beneath the boughs of a maple tree and laid it on the straw mat to impress me i remember being struck by its beauty the metal had a dull gray sheen its curves were perfect and smooth the oiled wood handle was richly grained but when i thought of its purpose as i listened to his stories it ceased to be beautiful and became something monstrous instead   in hindsight its not that i wanted sayuri to suffer i did want her to find happiness as is often the case it was the execution which discouraged and left me wanting a stronger outcome a bonified earned outcome golden could have adhered to what was previously a charactercentric story as such he couldve followed its natural conclusion if hed done that the ending couldve permeated greatness and the whole couldve been remarkable i really believe that but by veering so far away from the established formula i lost respect for the author it tainted the storysayuris story for me and maybe thats the saddest reality of all  i dont like to harp on that ending but without a solid and believable denouement it kind of ruins the story as a whole and sometimes if its decent i can overlook it unfortunately i cant say that about memoirs the most i can give it is  stars memoirs of a geisha written by arthur golden and published in  by alfred a knopf the novel went on to become a runaway bestseller and remained there for more than a year it also spawned an awardwinning film adaptation in  starring zhang ziyi crouching tiger hidden dragon  and michelle yeoh star trek discovery as mameha despite their accolades there were valid reasons for controversy both mediums in fact were equally scorned and celebrated albeit for different reasons the novel was predominantly questionable due to mineko iwasakis gr link claims that goldens portrayal of her character was grossly inaccurate the result was a commonly known lawsuit against the author and the aforementioned publisher for character defamation breach of contract and copyright violation the film adaptation directed by rob marshall of chicago fame was criticized for casting chinese actors in lieu of japanese performers  needless to say its easy to recognize its merits as well as its flaws a quarter of a century after its initial publication the novel is still largely di
"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1)",this is the first book where i chronicled my thoughts as i read through it with my son i dont know how easy it is for yall to access the record of those here on goodreads but if youre looking for a detailed account of my thoughts on the book you can look there  ill say this ive read a lot of books to my little boy these last couple years and i can honestly say that this book is among the best good tight writing good description good action also theres not a lot of dead space or trashy empty dialogue that just seems to be there to take up space thats become a particular peeve lately and when youre reading a book aloud it becomes really obvious  the british slang will be a stumbling block to some but its not too bad and there were a few slight pieces of sexism that i ignored skipped over or reworded on the fly but honestly this book was written  years ago and you need to cut it a little slack because of that and in my opinion it only needs a little slack truth be told ive read books written this year that have ten times the sexism this one does  also id like to make it clear that this is the first book of the narnia chronicles this is where you start the series im sorry if you read them in the wrong order but if you did its better than you admit it now come to grips and move on with your life knowing the truth if ever they remembered their life in this world it was as one remembers a dream  the real world is boring its mundane unimaginative and dry so humans create fantasy as a means of escape we watch movies or go to the theatre to see something more interesting than the standard realities of the everyday we paint pictures and gaze up at the stars we play video games and roleplay we dream authors like cs lewis and jk rowling show us this miserable world they show us its tones of grey then underneath it all they reveal something spectacular they reveal fantasy  so we have four rather ordinary children about to embark on an extraordinary adventure as a child i used to always daydream ive always been somewhat introverted and would prefer imagining faraway places than existing in the now i still do this as an adult and this is why i love fantasy so much because it is so immersive it literally takes my mind away lucy susan edward and peter are the lucky ones when they stumble across the wardrobe the gateway into a more interesting realm they experience something spectacular  she did not shut it properly because she knew that it is very silly to shut oneself into a wardrobe even if it is not a magic one  description  sure theres a war going on and certainly theres an evil witch going around murdering people but for me thatd be a price worth paying for in narnia there is also aslan and a whole bunch of interesting characters there is hope magic and companionship the wise old aslan though is the star of the show he sacrifices himself for his friends for his people though one issue i have with the book and one that makes me very much aware of the text as a construct is the questions over why aslan actually needed to the four children he pretty much deals with the problems by himself theres prophecy involved but on a plot level he clearly could have sorted this mess out without any outside interference  ive seen a lot of hate over these books because of the christian allegories involved in the storytelling now i find this somewhat stupid im not a christian far from it but you cant really criticise a book because of this its incredibly nave it would be like judging jane eyre based on its feminism aspects or shakespeares exploration of colonialism in the tempest its silly this book is undeniable full of christian dogmatism but its what the author wanted it to be if you read tolkiens work there are so many allusions the world wars this doesnt affect the overall storytelling its simply what is there read this with an open mind as an english literature student i read the bible i dont believe the words inside but i can still enjoy the experience and this story is no different take it for what it is  wrong will be right when aslan comes in sight at the sound of his roar sorrows will be no more when he bares his teeth winter meets its death and when he shakes his mane we shall have spring again  description  and thats something special i do however much prefer the works of tolkien i feel that his writing is more universal in terms of age audience with this though im very much aware of it as a childrens book the prose is designed to sound like a childrens bedtime story in places thats not exactly a bad thing though i love narnia but i can at least from my perspective objectively say that tolkien was a better writer though what narnia does have is aslan its hard not to aslan wouldnt it be just wonderful if he met gandalf could you imagine the stories those two could share im dreaming again yall are out there watching avengers endgame while i am at home watching the classic s cartoon of the lion the witch and the wardrobe a whole lotta nostalgia going on  why am i watching it right now  well i just finished a reread of the book and it is simply as magical as i remember it is a well written fantasy story that is not too complex and therefore is accessible to young and old alike it does indeed have christian allegory but it is up to you whether you want to read it with that in mind or not  one thing about the dialogue is that while it is simple there are some words and phrases that are dated to the time period it was written because of this a dictionary may be helpful every so often throughout the book one place where google came in quite handy was in the chapter about turkish delight it might have been more common long ago or in other parts of the world but i was not quite sure what it is  finally the best part of this reread was that i read it out loud to my  and  year old it feels great to pass great books on to them also it was magical to watch how much they enjoyed it they were even drawing pictures of the characters and running around the house pretending to look for the wardrobe  side note some versions of the series have this as the first book some have it as the second even though i have read them all before i dont really have an opinion on the matter i think either order is just fine i have been a compulsive reader all my adult years  i always read because i was driven to see how a book ends that is wrongheaded  as any narnian will tell you we must read devotedly  purely out of love  but know what im now an old senior who as ts eliot says has been driven inland by the trades for the endless manoeuvring of buying and selling  and by extension treating your life as if it were a means to satisfying ends and nothing else its everywhere now  has driven me deeply back into my soul yes even as far as narnia  so here i am once again as i was when i was five and reading picture books  reading devotedly  with love it feels so good  now the first time i reviewed this book i was not ready to read with love the storm of agnostic protest my review elicited as you can see below bashed my head in  as sylvester always wanted to do to tweety  and forced my hand  and my hand had nary a trump card what can i say politics is not my cuppa  so here i was at the start of this july th weekend fast upon our canada day wanting to go back to my dreams  and dream is what i did  gulping down this book in two days  you know we christians live in narnia but those folks who carry agendas toil for the white queen  as does all of organization man a title that hits the nail in the head you know em  the movers  the shakers the armies of the night as mailer said in   my friends who first commented below form the political opposition to those armies bless em all but my more apolitical friends ignore the melee and keep reading devotedly and theyre right  i plan to join their ranks now dreaming like them my own way to the wild blue yonder  narnia im coming back  you know when lewis carrolls alice saw through the trump cards wicked hand she simply shouted why youre all nothing but a pack of cards and they all scattered to the four winds all form without substance  let them go  enough is enough  lets all gentle readers abandon the sad sights of the blind leading the blind for the real world of narnia once again  lets go back to reading devotedly  and loving it whats it with british literature how from a relatively small pool of population can such creative writers emerge i dont like cs lewiss non fiction books but here he knocked the ball out of the park  aslan whose antics and decision making and beliefs are difficult to map is the way by which the children triumph if alice in wonderland was positively secular tltwatw is heavily defined by the christian mythos  there are many shining examples of pause to let the tension play out before a little more of the adventure is revealed curiously along with wonder it is with the realization that i read this book its very much anglo saxon in nature yet it lends itself to translation so easily its a book that does not belong to any age decade or era  its a little wonder of writing the figures agree with me this book is apparently one of the top  bestselling books of all time  stars to cs lewiss the lion the witch and the wardrobe adored it i must have read it three or four times as a child hits all the spots in my reading dreams a forest a large family talking animals secrets mystery drama hidden messages saga and series every child should read it  imagination runs free here  children stuck a house  goes exploring and finds herself lost in the world of narnia and the rest follow her  siblings fight the book shows what happens when you dont listen to one another  aslan the hero lion helps show what sacrifice is all about good stuff  i spent many a days looking for the secret world hidden somewhere in my closets while i never actually transported to another world this book is like its own narnia  a transport into something magical i loved this book it was first read to me in th grade we would all come in from lunch and our teacher would read to us for about  minutes before we would start class i remember this book because it wasnt read to us by mrs graham but instead it would be read by mr goodwin her longhaired bearded birkenstock wearing teachers aid over the next few weeks we were enthralled by this story we couldnt wait for lunch period to be over so we could hear what was happening in this magic kingdom called narnia from the begining we all identified with lucy and her siblings how was it possible that an english girl could transport herself to another place simply by hiding in a wardrobe and once through the wardrobe there was this wonderful and friendly creature called a faun mr tumnus all this in only the first chapter as the chapters progressed we got to know more about the siblings and the other creatures who inhabit narnia some people critisize cs lewis for using too much christian symbolism but i was in th grade and to me this was the most wonderful and exciting book ever written for children  when mr goodwin finished the book i instantly went to the library so i could read it myself i was very proud this was the first book i read without pictures to my joy i discovered there were other books about narnia and i eventually read all of them too evenutually i discovered other wonderful places in other books and i continue to look for them today i will always be grateful to mr goodwin he started off by telling me about narnia but in the end he introduced me to so much more through my on going love of books thank you mr goodwin for everything some thoughts recently crossed my mind in regards to arguments one could offer as a defence of the christian side of this novel the main arguments against this novel as a christian allegory that i have heard are aslan is not a strong christfigure that cs lewis preaches a black and white morality so im going to roughly address them from my perspective and hope it encourages some discussion   i will agree that aslan is not a strong christfigure firstly for aslan to really represent christ he would have to be true to the gospel story in other words he would have to be god made into man come to die for all mankind however as he only dies for the one traitor again its not sticking true to the biblical gospel that all have sinned and that christ was needed as a sacrifice for that sin if you take things too literally here cs lewis novel doesnt make much that much sense theologically as a result ill explain where i amwas going with that in a moment   i debate that cs lewis preaches in his novel occasionally he can be a touch patronising but compared to many authors he rarely slips into such condescension as for his morality i think you must understand it from the perspective of christianity christianity is about black and white morality essentially good versus evil light vs dark and truth vs lies etc it is also very grey in that christianity is about life and the fact that no one is perfect that everyone fits into that moral grey area of course i explain roughly and inadequately  ultimately i see that there is room to argue that cs lewis does a poor job of writing an allegorical novel however i see it as a very subtle novel that unlike others for instance the alchemist does not build its story around expressing an ideology but rather incorporates an ideology into its storytelling i think that if one wants to criticise this novel it should be for not properly showing the gospel rather than for preaching i know that i and many others enjoyed the story first before seeing the connection between it and the biblical tales i enjoyed it even more afterwards so then again i could be a tad biased  original review  to begin i must note that i grant this such a high rating due to the impact it had on my life it to me is one novel that were i to pick the one novel that forged a love of books for me it would be the lion the witch and the wardrobe why because i can remember back about twelve years ago when i was homeschooled by my mother as a five year old we wandered down during winter into the warm back room and she read the first narnia book to us the image of a red faun carrying parcels as he passed a growing lamppost would stick with me from that moment as it stuck with cs lewis as i learned to read the narnia books were the first novels i sunk my growing reading teeth into and to this day i have read and re read the novels back to front and maybe front to back  the lion the witch and the wardrobe is a novel written for both children and adults it contains highly allegorical elements as cslewis was a wellknown apologetics writer however he wrote that he did not write his novel as a pure allegory but as a story and that is what the lion the witch and the wardrobe is a story to be enjoyed by everyone and although written in simple language the reader can quickly concisely and easily imagine the world without the clumsy constraints of overused words i personally cannot imagine a world without these novels  additional thoughts   just a question at last and one with a highly philosophical twist to it why is it that people so readily condemn those books which are considered as moral tales youd think we could do with more morality in such a twisted and confused world regardless of accepting the belief systems   i have heard many people describe the entire series as silly and far too preachy i do not see it that way at all trust me if cslewis wanted to be preachy he would have written a lot more philosophy and less story yes i can see how some would call this silly but then i argue that they are missing the point its a fairytale type fantasy intended mainly for children and for those children again as adults or for their parents perhaps but i argue that as lewis only wrote this story based on the story of the crucifixion in many ways that it was not intended as a preachy book my question is that why is it that if i were to base a story along what some call the christian myth it is claimed as preaching while as if i were to base it on any other mythology or story it would be deemed as merely copying the themes of another mythology is this yet another example of doublethink classic good versus evil childrens story with appeal for all ages and strong christian message have read this lovely book a few times over the years this time with my son i wonder if hell be looking for narnia in his wardrobe like i did as a child id like to recommend reading the series in publication order not in chronological order starting with the lion the witch and the wardrobe and not the magicians nephew back when i was a little kid i used to get hyped up with my sister when ever any of the our three favorite worlds would broadcast on tv those three are harry potter the lord of the ring and chronicles of narnia i loved those days and i lived this world it left a mark i cannot count how many times i have read this book but this is my first audio version  oh the sacrifice and resurrection scene is just as moving listening to it as it is reading it thats always been my favorite part so meaningful and symbolic  im already finished and could just start it again i cannot express how much i adore this book well can you blame me for loving this i certainly hope not its christmas and i feel like a little kid and i was craving something to make me feel like i am one indeed and this book travelled me to a wondrous world full of heroes and of course a villain the ride was awesome and i found the characters warm and fuzzy despite the eternal cold that had been placed upon narnia now theyre all free of the curse of the white witch thanks to peter susan edmund and lucy the kings and queens of narnia  once a king or queen of narnia always a king or queen of narnia   this is remarkable its amazing how short it is i only read it in one and a half hour i simply devoured it its short but so detailed and concentrated its like a fairytale ill certainly be reading this to my kids in the future  i wrote this story for you but when i began it i had not realized that girls grow quicker than books as a result you are already too old for fairy tales and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still but some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again you can then take it down from some upper shelf dust it and tell me what you think of it i shall probably be too deaf to hear and too old to understand a word you say but i shall still be your  affectionate godfather c s lewis read as a little girl and loved it loved the mysterious places and fantasy lives and i always wanted my wardrobe to enter into a magical land this book is worth more than  stars after i first read this book as a young boy i remember distracting my father one day whilst he was working in his shed at the bottom of our garden i was about  at the time and my father was filing away at something in the vice attached to the work bench i spotted the pincerspliers in his old wooden toolbox and secreted them away in my knitted cardigan fashion was not a strong point back in the s and i sheepishly snook out without being noticed that was the beginning of the adventure for an eleven year boy when i got back to my bedroom i closed the door and went about removing the panel pins from the backing boards at the rear of my wardrobe i remember it took what seemed to be an eternity and i froze every time i heard somebody on the landing outside my bedroom door waiting for my mothers voice enquiring what i was up to it never came and i felt relieved and a great sense of accomplishment when the last pin was removed and i was able to step into my wardrobe and out the other side i pulled the wardrobe slightly away from the wall and was able to trig the boards back in without them falling out i had lots of fun inviting friends around after school and showing them that when i stepped into my wardrobe i disappeared into a portal and into a new world when my friends opened the door all they saw was some clothes and the backboards of course the joke did not last long as children are inquisitive and found out eventually we had so much fun pretending we stepped through my wardrobe into narnia the fun lasted for about two weeks before my mother found out and my father reattached the back boards i remember as an eleven year old boy my imagination was so vivid children back then had so much fun creating characters and worlds today not so much in this digital world of game boys and mob phones etc reading books is all about expanding the mind food for thought and i yearn back nostalgically to those times the films based on the books are great but i personally think the book should be read first every time i read this story i feel happy i love fairytales and mythology and i believe this books is the perfect example of how fantasy mythology and fairytales can be combined and create a strong result   first of all there is obviously the the snow queen fairytale by hans christian andersen the ultimate evil woman whose myth is used in this book too she brings cold and misery and never allows christmas she changes peoples heart and eyes she freezes their hearts like block of ice she makes their eyes to see only the bad and ugly in people and things she will isolate and steal the little boy from his siblings she will change him and make him taste the dark side and the betrayal  then there is a combination of mythology by different cultures and countries the faun the centaurs the minotaurs from the greek and roman mythology faun can be met also in english mhthology as puck william shakespeares play a midsummer nights dream  giants jack and the beanstalk ogres and boggles from the northumbrian and scots  there are unicorns and werewolves with stories that can be found as far back as history has been written  there are the talking animals that we meet in so many old fairytales like three little pigs little and red riding hood with the evil wolf brothers grimm  kings and queens princes and princesses that we meet in every fairytale and history telling  there is a touch of alice in wonderland lewis carroll where lucy instead of falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world and following the rabbit she goes through a wardrobe and follows the faun there is santa claus or father christmas the traditional english name for the personification of christmas who brings useful gifts  finally there are so many childrens novels in th century where children meet strange magical creatures and change their life and their thinking five children and it by e nesbit  the lion the witch and the wardrobe teaches children merits like personal sacrifices for the general good friendship love and commitment and also it includes negative concepts like betrayal deceiving and suffering  the good thing is that there is always time for a cup of tea what an amazingly delightful book i regret not reading it earlier   before i begin let me clarify that as i am not a christian i had no idea that this book was written by keeping the image of jesus as aslan in mind i just came across this revelation on goodreads and it just added another layer to the story the review below is written only by treating it as a funfilled and action packed novel  narnia     i had seen the movie based on the book a couple of years ago and had really loved it on reading the book i realized its just an extention of the movieshould have been the other way round but then the one which comes first usually forms the greater impression im glad the scripwriters did not destroy the essence of the story which is though simple a charming tale  anyway coming back to the story it is about four adventurous children who accidentally discover the magical world of narnia behind a wardrobe in an old strange house but all in not well in this magical land its under the reign of the evil queen  the white witch together with the help of a magnificant lion  aslan the children go on to kill the witch and themselves become the four kingsand queens of narnia  though lacking much plot twists i loved it simply because it was so easyflowing i altually wished i had a naughty kid near me whom i could catch hold of and read the book aloud to i would love to see his wideeyed amazement when lucy would open the wardrobe for the first time see his dissapointment when edmund would betray them hear his sigh when aslan would sacrifice his life and catch that gleeful smile when they would win the battle  maybe someday sometime  ps i really liked the dedication  it read   my dear lucy i wrote this story for you but when i began it i had not realized that girls grow quicker than books as a result you are already too old for fairy tales and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still but some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again you can then take it down from some upper shelf dust it and tell me what you think of it i shall probably be too deaf to hear and too old to understand a word you say but i shall still be your affectionate godfather cslewis  dear god i hope im never too old for fairy tales reading aloud to my kids and thinking how old fashioned yet lovely the language is in this book and yes i read to them from my copy from a box set that i think was originally my brother jasons i remember reading this over and over starting in fifth grade its not my favorite of the books that varies between dawn treader and silver chair and magicians nephew but its still wonderful and yes im a purist they are read in order of publication thank you not chronologically what a great family read aloud my eight six and four year old and husband enjoyed hearing this the four year old flagged a bit but the eight year old got the allegory a fantastic story so well told this is the story of four siblings who stumble through a wardrobe into a different world they discover magic monsters and their destiny  one christmas when i was  or  my mother gave me the chronicles of narnia it ignited a lifelong love of fantasy fiction and reading  peter susan its all true edmund has seen it too there is country you can get to through the wardrobe edmund and i both got in we met one another in there in the wood pg   i get the criticisms of this series that it is heavy handed with its symbolism  but when i read it as a child all of that slipped right over my head all i knew was that this was an adventure and i loved it  the white witch is one of the best villains in childrens literature as for you said the witch giving edmund a stunning blow on the face as she remounted the sledge let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors drive on and edmund for the first time in this story felt sorry for someone besides himself pg   she opposes aslan a great golden lion and the ruler of narnia who hasnt been seen for an age and now said aslan presently to business i feel i m going to roar you had better put your fingers in your ears and they did and aslan stood up and when he opened his mouth to roar his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it pg   the film did a solid job capturing the magic of this story but nothing compares to the book  once a king in narnia always a king in narnia pg   in fact just writing up this review makes me want to read them all again  ill see you on the other side of the wardrobe im rereading this book because i want to read the remaining books in the series im also reading this series with my  years old son i let him read first so while i read this book hes reading book  im confused by the order of the series so im reading in the order of the publication date in my next reread i may read by the order the book indicates anyhow this book was fantastic i loved the way the author worded his sentences i enjoyed mrs beavers humor i loved peter as the oldest brother he seemed fair to lucy and apologized when hes wrong i liked how he obtained opinions from his siblings before deciding something lucy was sweet and lovable the animals in narnia were so nice like the faun and the beavers  the author narrated the story as if he had witnessed the happenings he told about the siblings peter susan edmund and lucy in that order from oldest to youngest the children move into an old professors house for summer break it was one rainy day that the children played hide and seek indoors when during hiding lucy discovered narnia while hiding in the wardrobe the faun mr tumnus was to kidnap lucy and bring her to the white witch but he decided to save her instead the next child to discover narnia was edmund the white witch queen found him and got him hooked on her turkish delights the third visit into narnia all four siblings ended up there one sibling was a spy for the witch while the other three went to meet the lion king of narnia to rescue mr tumnus and eventually rescue the spy sibling  the lion the witch and the wardrobe was well written and a fast paced read the differences between the siblings were well portrayed because of course theres one thatll be selfish i liked the name aslan sounds cool loved the magic and the animals its awesome how the siblings grew up in narnia and then get to be children again when they were back home again how peculiar or proper the children talked in narnia i wish the author included the siblings ages i cant wait to read the rest of the series highly recommended this book my first time reading this and just beyond thrilled i read it  big stars such beautiful storytelling by cs lewis i love the world of narnia aslan was my favorite character what else can i say most of you know the story and its such a magical one that i know i will return to again and again i cant wait to tell this story to my sweet little boy one day the christian allegory in this is top tier thankful for stories like this  i edited this review slightly just now to italicize a book title and to change the word order of one sentence to make the intended meaning a bit clearer  while i first read this book in the mids i read it again to my wife a couple of years ago we both loved it then as much as i did the first time most people know that c s lewis was an effective christian nonfiction apologist using the tools of reason and logic to build the philosophical case for christian faith but he ultimately became convinced that an even more effective apologetic is available through the truth of art the instinctive and emotional appeal that stories exert  especially the kinds of stories that draw on the deep mythical archetypes of fantasy to illuminate the real universe the chronicles of narnia his classic fantasy series was the fruit of that discovery set in narnia a magical land whose world lies in another universe in which magic works and time moves differently than it does here and in which christ is incarnate as the great talking lion aslan this first book of the series presents one of the most powerful symbolic literary presentations of the christian gospel ever written although the intended audience in lewis mind was children and his various direct authors addresses to the readers presuppose this there is nothing invidiously juvenile about the quality of the writing it can be enthusiastically appreciated by anyone who loves tales of imagination and adventure fantasy and wonder and the truths here like those in jesus parables are simple enough to speak to children but profound enough to challenge adults  this is the first book of the series in the sense of first to be written and usually the first to be read however the magicians nephew is a prequel which describes the creation of narnia and the origins of the white witch and of the wardrobe that serves as a gateway to narnia lewis himself recommended that this prequel be read first now it was the old bbc version that used to play on ytv that introduced this young canadian girl in the s to this wonderful series oh how i wanted to be lucy traveling back through that wardrobe and meeting mr tumnus admittedly i still do some days perhaps the most familiar book in the series for me the lion the witch and the wardrobe is just a darn good book  jadis the white witch has placed narnia under a permanent winterspell complete with secret police and royal edicts enter four british schoolchildrenpeter susan edmund and lucy escaping the blitz and finding themselves travelling through to defeat evil and rule as the new regents it is still a fairly exciting story for people of any age this series is one of my all time favourites and this book in particular is definitely my favou
The Odyssey,i usually dont rate books  star but the odyssey was dreadfully boring for me most of the book i found that i couldnt follow the action andor the dialogue and it was all just extremely tedious  there were a few clever moments like when odysseus had to outsmart the cyclops but the dialogue and the begats ie telamachus son of odysseus who is laertes son just got in the way of the narrative the plot felt very disjointed  after reading this im leary about reading other ancient epics like arabian nights which i have on my tbr the only other book like this that ive read is the epic of gilgamesh in college which i actually remember enjoying  i wish i could come up with more positive but i just didnt enjoy the odyssey i so wanted to like this because it is a classic but maybe its just not my thing accoording to what i know about odysseus i believe that he should not be in the hero hall of fame nomination committee he killed innocent people  cheated on his wife and ate his friends i believe that says it all about who odysseus really is instead of a review i made an honest trailer for this book link below please check it out and let me know what you think i understand that this book is known as a classic and that its one of the most famous pieces of literature of all time what i dont understand is why i get that the plot and vocabulary is of its time but i found this book to be utterly and incredibly boring i could hardly get through a few pages without wanting to take a nap there was not a single character that i was rooting for or sympathized with odysseus was not a hero he was a guy who disrespected the gods out smarted them eventually and in the midst of all that cheated on his wife on several occasions there is nothing heroic about that everything about this translation feels like an anomaly and i feel cranky disagreeing with the heaps of praise is it important because it is unpoetic poetry because its the first time a woman proves she could translate the odyssey because a white woman from a postcolonial empire i am one of those too so i mean no disrespect has faithfully and literally transcribed a long story about an unrepentant slavekeeping culture and that book has been praised by npr and the new york times and um rl stine the consensus is that this is a translation not just for our time but for the ages im disappointed to say that i found the language dull the imagery flat the emotion mawkish and the story full of cartoonish characters and unconvincing motivations im as impressed as anyone by the linguistic and historical feat emily wilson here performs but i wish that the odyssey were more worthy of the effort i know i know youre all throwing tomatoes at me how can the odyssey not be worth the effort i admit that i had previously known the famous set pieces of the tale because i had read them as a child and then read them to my children from picture books and anthologies lets be honest those stories are famous because they are horrifically violent not because they are full of nuanced human interaction i knew the love story of penelope and odysseus chiefly through the wallace stevens poem the world as meditation i think in fact i expected the unabridged poem to be a very long rendering of a tragic family saga by someone like wallace stevens but instead of lines such as this  the trees had been mended as an essential exercise in an inhuman meditation larger than her own no winds like dogs watched over her at night  we get direct rather clunky translation of action and dialogue i understand that directness is the goal of wilsons version the language is intentionally simple and intentionally restricted to the length and chronology and action of the source text but what this served to do for me and maybe only me is to reveal huge flaws in a story i had always accepted as an essential and ennobling tale one that is deeply imbedded in our collective psyche the particular collective psyche being the american school curriculum as a descendant of the british school curriculumstripped of the direct study of latin and greek but not of homer greek myths and poems written by greekliterate british men in the th and th centuries when the story is not made poetically new with fresh imagining of the way it might feel to be nausicaa or elpenor or penelope it is a little like watching a quentin tarantino film turned into cgi animation odysseus seems not noble or sympathetic but narcissistic and callous and the world he lives in is one of caprice ruled over by the supernatural and i can understand the former but find the latter frustratingly unlike the world im trying to comprehend murder is condoned by the gods andor by the evocation of fate that the greek world was like this is not a revelation in itself i realize but this translation or perhaps any unabridged version makes it puzzlingly remote why do we revere it still why do we hand it down with a respect that we give to almost nothing else because its a superhero story and we can never get enough of those because the beauty of certain ideas the passing over a river to reach the land of the deadis enough to make us accept ugly ones such as the constant raping of mortal women by male gods  i am both glad and sorry to have read the whole tale from beginning to end and to be disillusioned about it odysseus is a flat character for me now far less real than a shakespearean hero or a tolstoyan one penelope too seems flat and false they act out virtues and vices rather than embody them and in a way thats proof that the myth of progress is perhaps not a myth at all we can learn to tell truer stories we have many novels and many poems that are deeper more complex and in the end more ennobling than homers odyssey perhaps then the great gift of wilsons thorough and plain transcription is to strip away the archaic language that kept us from seeing that the story we have loved all these centuries may be about a hero wed do well not to love agonizing boredom from start to finish pages of hell this honestly was the worst you could not pay me to explain even a page of this maybe even less than a one star rating yeah finally done this book is so boring trust me i didnt chose to read this book i was forced to by school  this book is just i cant even get to dramatic odysseus is such a pig go live with some random women oh excuse some goddess and then sleep with her and then instead of living with her why dont you try getting home you been gone for  years what the heck man then when he gets home he tells his wife about what happened to him and conveniently forgets to say that he was being a hog i have no respect for the author or this book people act like this book is so good my own father was like looking at the back of the book and was like it says its the greatest tale of all time welp i guess thats how they suck you into reading garbage this book sucks i feel bad for the future kids who have to read this book in school reading the odyssey and the iliad has always been an aim of mine but one that was put on the long finger constantly but in  the same year i internallyscreamed my way through paradise lost and the divine comedy emily wilson published the first translation of the odyssey by a woman  ever what better time to take this challenge on board  i first encountered this edition when wilson was interviewed about it and described a couple of key changes in her translation the essay itself is wonderful and really opened my eyes to the vicissitudes of translating her main changes are around the greek word to describe odysseus that means manyturning which she chose to translate as complicated i thought that was fantastic then theres her more political choices to accurately describe odysseus household staff not as maids but as slaves and her decision to call helen hounded rather than a dogfaced bitch and her refusal to categorise the women who slept with the suitors as whores these decisions may be controversial  particularly to those who consider women in this field an incursion a description the tls podcast let slide without inquiry  but they are right in my wheelhouse i thought id be much less angry reading this story when a woman was behind the wheel  turns out no there are two problems one is that long form poetry in the st century just feels fucking weird to read i can summon up any movie ever made in seconds this in contrast is asking things of me ive never had to give the repetition in this and other narrative poems so necessary for a listening audience who might be hearing it over days or weeks is entirely redundant for me  and excessively irritating to read theres no room for nuance when you need to keep saying wise penelope and godlike telemachus so people a remember who the characters are and b remember key traits about them from audience to audience secondly while wilson is female homer is not i know academics debate this but jesus no woman would write other women like this  the translation is easy to read and i can see where wilson deliberately kept it simple and clear i dont have issues with the translation although i havent read any others to compare my issue is with the story itself it sucks  ive owned a retelling of the odyssey by rosemary sutcliffe and illustrated by alan lee since i was a child im gonna come right out and say the pleb opinion hers is much better shes taken the structure of the story and made odysseus appear like the cunning honorable heroic man the odyssey keeps saying he is in reality hes a mega dick who just keeps spouting boring offtopic stories whenever hes asked a question i reckon in the background people were just like give this dude whatever he wants its the only way to shut him tf up he lies to his wife his father and his son he lies to gods he just lies theyre not even good lies theyre not even narrativelypropulsive lies they are the lies of an oral storyteller who cant remember the next bit so just makes something up  page three description of odysseus he is more sensible than other humans and makes more sacrifices to the gods i mean thats it right there in a nutshell the value system in this story is two or three plus millennia out of whack by my lights someone who makes the most sacrifices to any gods is less sensible by virtue of that fact than anyone else  speaking of gods what is athenas deal is she just not that great at being an allpowerful being this whole story is like the we dont talk about the eagles issue in lotr shes great at putting people to sleep and making them temporarily hot but if shes so great why doesnt she just fly odysseus home and dont at me with reasons she gives zero reasons not even narrative ones like i am testing him or hes annoyed me and i am seeing how he works through these challenges before i forgive him shes female after all why would she have sensible motivations  everyone in this entire story is keto so much meat so much meat on skewers i know this is before chocolate but did they ever eat a vegetable even  and their favourite hobby that dear friends is crying they cry all the time until theyre so tired from crying they fall asleep in fairness this was also before television  what is curious though is that what a thousand years more before jesus theres a whole poem which basically says be good to strangers because you never know when they might be angels in disguise except in this case theyre gods not angels but theres a strong theme of treating guests ridiculously well odysseus basically sets up a cargo cult with the phaeacians its a wonder people have anything left to give or why beggars even exist after a certain point any man of sense will treat a guest in need like his own brother  i mean obviously people just ignored that because if you do this universally theres no one left in need  speaking of phaeacians they are down with incest so theres that  all of this before i even get started on the gross treatment of women agammemon who killed his own daughter says without a shade of irony that his wife has such an evil mind that she has poured down shame on her own head and on all other women even good ones i cant even he is doubly as evil as she was but we dont see his sin being visited on every subsequent generation like thats even a fair thing to want he goes on to advise you must never treat your wife too well do not let her know everything you know like buddy friend maybe theres your fucking problem right there  odysseus old nurse is the first woman to recognise him his response to her delight is to grab her by the throat and choke her till she promises to stay silent something i might add she was very willing to do without being choked  and penelope oh man nothing about this storyline makes sense lets leave aside the obvious disparity between odysseus having all the sex with various nymphs and minor goddesses and probably lots of unwilling slave girls too lets be real and the in and metatextual assumption that penelope should keep herself puuuuuuure for the same two decades theres also the fact that she is so uberpopular even though she has a twentyyearold son shes therefore between thirtyfive and forty years old at this point in a time when population health was hella bad and life expectancy was probably fortyfive shes not a fertile field is what im saying why arent all these eligible bachelors going after women who could actually give them the sons they want odysseus has a sister nobody cares  and while i can get that she would be upset by losing her husband its been a decade since the war ended and he was last seen shes still crying herself to sleep over it every night that isnt normal because penelope isnt a person shes a trope shes the ideal woman who sits and listens to her man describe his trysts with other women and just nods along because thats fine its all fine shes on fire but its fine  i just i really hated this poem my hatred is in direct opposition to how much i loved the wanderings of odysseus and the hurt cautious penelope who right to the end cant believe her luck but ends up leading her husband to their awesome treebed in celebration thats the hero and heroine i have loved my whole life homer and his ugly misogynistic histrionic weirdos can go jump off a cliff a couple of comments on this book   the intro is waaaaay too long i really could care less about telemachus traveling and proving himselfblah blah blah blah blah   the battle scene was pretty epicsome strange details thrown in there stabbed in the nipplegruesomebut kind of funny   i think its pretty messed up that odysseus can sleep with whoever he wants and penelope remains faithfulrepeat messed up closing comments i dont really like this book the end hey homer ever learn what a runon sentence is i guess not because thats what your whole book is a long tedious monotonous tome about the journey of a man who has slept with half of greece but wants to go home and have his wife forgive him if you want that plot line summed up just listen to whatcha say by jason i sing my name at the beginning of all of my songs derulo my goodness was this a boring book or what this was one of the worst books ive ever read i mean i get that its a classic and everybody should like it and all of that other pretense but i did not enjoy one bit of this book im sorry to say again i hate epic poems this is a captivating story that could easily be condensed omitting all of the unneccessary repetitive language and be transformed from boring into banging this book was boring in my opinion i didnt like it at all i thought it was really long and boring for me this book was pretty much about a guy who cheated on his wife and i didnt like it even as an english major i dont think i will ever be mature enough to enjoy or understand this book i didnt understand anything that happened in this book except one thing all of the characters need severe therapy especially odysseus odysseus couldve gone home so many times if it werent for his arrogance i dont care who everyones father is in this story just introduce the characters so i can finish this train wreck of a book booooooorrringggggmy farts are more entertaining than this overrated piece of turd omg this book is so confusing reading it in school and very confused  hallelujah i have finished this book my torture is over except for that essay but ya know odysseus can go die in a hole for all i care bc i never have to look at this book again confusing and misogynistic my friends and i all thought that yes it is a classic but it is outdated and not a good influence for anyone too many sexist white men rick riordan tells greek mythology better proud member of the odysseustelemachus hate club  percy jackson taught me more than this book every could reread it again and still hate it  i had no idea what was happening all i know is that odysseus is a slut not to sound marxist here but this entire story intends to belittle working folk  it is a constant stream of compliments to the virtues of the wealthy and powerful with subtle and notsosubtle remarks regarding the qualities of common people the virtues which these princely characters possess which ought to make us so endeared to them include beauty athleticism speaking ability and wisdom beauty is of course a petty standard of virtue but it is consistently used to separate the common individual from the noteworthy wisdom is even worse in my eyes though if you pay attention it is pretty easy to determine what homer considers wisdom look at this quote where telemachus speaks to his mother when she takes offense to a song  so go to your quarters now and attend to your own work the loom and the spindle and tell the servants to get on with theirs talking must be the mens concern and mine in particular for i am master in this house penelope was taken aback and she retired to her own apartments for she was impressed by the good sense that her son had shown  by wisdom or good sense here homer seems to mean successfully ascribing to social norms im not going to quote a bunch of sections but i think a pretty clear pattern emerges if you are interested in looking for yourself finally the other two ohsoimportant virtues are athleticism and public speaking these qualities certainly deserve some praise but these are considered far too important the following quote i hope will illustrate what im talking about it is a scene where some young athletes have just put on a competition and are now challenging the weary odysseus to compete he refuses which elicits the following response  euryalus now saw fit to interpose and insult him to his face i should never have taken you for an athlete such as one is accustomed to meet in the world but rather for some skipper of a merchant crew who spends his life on a hulking tramp worrying about his outward freight or keeping a sharp eye on the cargo when he comes home with the profits he has snatched  what is it about being an athlete that makes one so refined what is it about being an honest and successful sailor that is so deplorable even more deplorable though is odysseus response  with a black look the nimblewitted odysseus retorted that sir was an ugly speech and you must be a fool to have made it it shows that we cannot all hope to combine the pleasing qualities of good looks brains and eloquence with this he leapt to his feet and not even troubling to remove his cloak picked up the biggest disk of all a huge weight more massive by far than those used in their regular matches with one swing he launched it from his mighty hand and the stone hummed on its course the phaeacians lords of the sea and champions of the long oar cowered down as it hurtled through the air and so lightly did it fly from his hand that it overshot the marks of all the other throws athene pretending to be one of the crowd marked the distance of the cast and saluted the thrower  in case that segment doesnt frustrate you too let me spell out exactly why it makes me cringe what we would expect in our day and age and yes i appreciate that this is not from our day and age is a statement pointing out the unfair treatment of working people in this mans insult instead here we have odysseus simply proving that he is an athlete well congratulations odysseus now lets all bow down and kiss his feet because he has proven that he can throw the biggest disk  its simply deprived of any real meaning other than that we should be impressed by this fictional character now here is where i would argue that the goal is for people in their awe to equate the royalty and leaders in their lives and times with this macho man who is so lovable and honorable and wise  notice the flow of the story for both odysseus and his son some lame dudes are sitting around dissing telemachus and odysseus and wasting their money so telemachus heads out and meets some guy who knew his dad and who gives him a bunch of expensive stuff because of how virtuous telemachus and his father are then telemachus heads to another dudes house who proceeds to give him even more expensive stuff and they both cry over how cool odysseus used to be when they were together then we see odysseus who is being rewarded with sex by some goddess chick because he is so virtuous he then leaves and crashes in some kingdom where he proves how virtuous he is and is receives a bunch of expensive things when he crash lands at the next place he starts banging another goddess chick until he leaves again so that he can be repeatedly complimented by dead people including some cameos from hercules and a bunch of famous dudes moms and mistresses then odysseus goes home secretly so that he can be complemented and cried over by the master of the hounds who is ugly of course and it goes on and on until finally those louses who mistreated the beautiful strong and wise odysseus and telemachus all get slaughtered by the duo  this is hardly a story at all it is closer to a list of stops and the gifts acquired the message underlying this tale seems pretty clear to me your leaders are beautiful manly and witty so why wouldnt you reward them with opulence labor and flattery it is propaganda to the highest degree meant to maintain the status quo this becomes even more apparent when you note that wisdom is practicing socially acceptable behavior and position the most admired commoner in the story the swineherd is portrayed as halfway intelligent because of his loyalty and kindness toward odysseus  beyond that issue though is a literary one the message of the story is not the only thing hamfisted in the odyssey the delivery feels like a mallet it is blunt predictable poorly paced repetitive and doesnt sound any better in greek than it does in english why for instance does every noun have to be qualified with an adjective it is always a comfortable chair the softest silk impressive strength sharp sword and so forth or why does everyone look specifically like a god every time they put their clothes on in the morning you can argue that these kind of things were part of a cultural style and id agree but no one should get away with using clichs excessive wordiness or constant redundancies in any era of writing  after these issue i take further offense to the book being dull contrived and thoroughly anticlimactic it also felt like an advertisement for the iliad at times with how many war stories you get specific details on athena was in the story constantly and rarely with good cause many times like the above quote she would simply be some random person marking the throw of a frisbee or some other meaningless action like that other times she would completely solve major problems for odysseus and telemachus in fact they hardly ever accomplished anything without her help which makes them pretty pathetic in the end they are just two stuck up dweebs who happen to be pretty enough to warrant some fickle goddesses assistance in all their endeavors  in the end i am repulsed at the praise the odyssey has received over the years ashamed that we have placed such a sad display of drivel on such a pedestal and baffled that one of the worst books i have ever read boasts such a legacy  the following are some of my favorite facepalm worthy quotes if you are interested  odysseus son put on his clothes and got up from his bed he slung a sharp sword from his shoulder bound a stout pair of sandals on his comely feet and strode from his bedroom looking like a god  when she had bathed him and rubbed him with olive oil she gave him a tunic and arranged a fine cloak round his shoulders so that he stepped out of the bath looking like an immortal god  helen with her ladies came down from her lofty perfumed room looking like artemis with her golden distaff adreste drew up for her a comfortable chair alcippe brought a rug of the softest wool while phylo carried her silver workbasket a gift from alcandre wife of polybus who lived in egyptian thebes where the houses are furnished in the most sumptuous fashion  dawn had just touched the east with crimson hands when the warrior menelaus put on his clothes and rose from bed he slung a sharp sword from his shoulder bound a fine pair of sandals on his shapely feet and strode from his bedroom looking like a god  my lord telemachus replied with his usual wisdom please do not insist on my paying you a lengthy visit  in the end odysseus address was not only disarming but full of subtlety mistress i throw myself on your mercy but are you some goddess or a mortal woman if you are on e of the gods who live in the sky it is of artemis the daughter of almighty zeus that your beauty and grace most remind me but if you are one of us mortals who live on earth then lucky indeed are your father and your gentle mother lucky your brothers too  athene daughter of zeus made him seem taller and sturdier than ever when odysseus retired to sit down by himself on the seashore he was radiant with comeliness and grace nausicaa gazed at him in admiration and said to her fair attendants when first we met i thought he cut a sorry figure but now he looks like the gods who live in heaven  many an eye was fixed in admiration on laertes keenwitted son whose head and shoulders athene invested with a more than human beauty besides making him seem taller and broader so that he might inspire the whole phaeacian people not only with affection but with fear and respect
A Christmas Carol,rating  of five  sentimental very very sentimental oh my gawd the sentimental is so deep  but so is the social message the deep disdain dickens brought to bear on scrooge and his religion of greed makes me smile his horror at the working conditions of children in cornish tin mines see below and his own life history of being forced into factory labor albeit not on the factory floor after his father was imprisoned for debt added to his sensitive social conscience to make this tale an angry denunciation of the unthinking untrammeled greed of his countrymen  dickens wrote a christmas carol in part as a response to the second report of the childrens employment commission of parliament he was inspired by this to visit the aforementioned cornish tin mines in operation since antiquity and was so enraged and horrified that he planned to bring his eloquence and command of a vast audience to bear on the problem in a political pamphlet instead and quite rightly as it turns out he told a story with the same moral stories are central to human life this story since its december  publication has never been out of print its characters have entered the vernaculareveryone in the anglophone world knows that being called a scrooge is a bad thing  i salute you mr dickens with an admiring and approving wave but i really really hate your writing it feels like having saccharinelaced lard applied to my eyelashes would to read the clunking thudding sentences ok so august probably isnt the right time of year to read this and probably why it didnt give me that christmas glow  i found this a strange read broken down into five short stories surrounding scrooge and the ghost that if im entirely honest i didnt understand at all which is a theme for me with dickens  its short at just over a hundred pages so i may actually read again at christmas time and perhaps then ill feel the magic a specter is haunting europe five years avant la lettre in which the holiday horror for any reasonable capitalist is socialism it was the first time i got to see some real christmas in literature but if any of you are planning to read this make sure you dont choose the audiobook the narrators do a good job but otherwise it doesnt stick at all yeah i know its a classic bah humbug way too predictable and as drab as a gray winter in london dickens is so fond of the plight of the street urchin the poor the downtrodden that it seems as though he is compelling you to feel for them and as atonement forgo your own selfish ways i felt like screaming at the book okay scrooge if you dont repent and change your ways then i the unfortunate reader will be forced to endure another visit from a christmas ghost oh so will you i parallel my frustration with this story to those darn trix commercials  couldnt those selfish kids just let the rabbit have a bowl of cereal couldnt dickens just make scrooge see the error of his ways and end this thing already i was able to get this ebook for free on my kindle so i decided i should simply read it already its one of those classics and the skies know im not really one to read classics since this isnt a very long one i thought itd be okay but i guess i proved myself wrong once more  i just felt like skimming most of it i hate how the writing of classics often isnt that easy  fluent to read and i know thats me making a big deal out of it but i cant help get annoyed by that aspect i hate it when i have to read sentences over and over to make sure i comprehend it correctly and thats exactly what i had to do with this novel as well  sure the story and the message itself  applause but i simply didnt really enjoy reading this book was boring just watch the movie  i personally didnt love this one in fact i think it was just okay i totally understand the moral of this story and why its such a popular classic but it was not my cup of tea most of the time i was way too distracted and wanted to do other things so when i was reading it i was completely lost like i know what it was about but it was just weird to me the last chapter and the page before were on the other hand really good  im still glad i read it because now i finally know what the story is about but its not something that i really enjoyed although this book is such a classic i felt like it was quite plain besides time after time there were some long descriptions with no real point at least it seemed so to me  there wasnt much action and it didnt really seem like the things shown by the spirits to scrooge would actually change that much in such a hard mans attitude to life and people the impact was so instantaneous that it was too unbelievable for me  i really liked the ending and wish there would be more details about the happy life of the scrooge and people around him oh my god i gave a dickens book two stars i kind of had to its a good story although having seen every possible stage and screen permutation of a christmas carol due to my fathers love for the story i can say that even disney improved on mr dickens telling by the time we met little bob and tiny tim i was crying but then i saw it were not tears but a simple syrup and i hope little bob was visited by the ghost of contraception or at least a ghost of abstinence ps but what next for jacob marley who cares right tim currys narration is a    stars beautiful voice acting  the contents of the book leans more    stars for me i tend not to enjoy the retelling as much as others so i decided to try the source material the writing reminded me of neil gaiman i am not a fan of neil gaimans writing style i also thought the ghost were complete ass holes contradicting their moral of the story just didnt jive with my ethics also call me a pessimist but the whole money doesnt buy you happiness morallife lesson annoys the living crap out of me imagine not being one book ahead of reading record rosalyn at  i tried i really tried this is my first book i am dnfing the beginning was very difficult to understand some passages i cant grasp at all but then it did get better quickly but it is feeling like its dragging on even though its a short book i dont care for dickens writing which is not to say its bad just not for me i know the over all message of the story and that is wonderful even though i am not christian i can still appreciate how this time of year in general is supposed to be about family friends giving and love its great and i love seeing my loved ones and the holiday joy i just cant get into this book sorry dickens but due to the good message in the story i cant give it just  star hence   maybe ill have better luck watching it there are plenty of movie adaptations  edit i watched the muppet christmas carol loved it i think it translates better on screen or a play than it does in book form for me personally  enjoyed the soft kink aspects and the romance but the character progression was rushed and tiny tims name scared me  my top five quotes  in no particular order  i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees  he had no further intercourse with spirits  said scrooge submissively  dick  scrooge fell upon his knees  please note that i was reading this for english so the only way i could get through this was to laugh at it i dont mean offense to this book i know many people love it i just found it funny i didnt like this book im not sure why it bored me at so many points i really liked the ending though  finally read it  not bad and made me think introspectively but my own past present and future which is always good at this time of the year i found this to be dark and i didnt much believe scrooges aboutface some people are scrooges like me ill take st patricks day as fav holiday and keep my spiritual life private and honest its been on my toread shelf for years and im glad i read it though its one about everyone reads but its one of my least favorites by dickens a christmas carol charles dickens    so as far as i can remember i believe this is the first time i have read this i have watched many adaptations so it was a great idea   so as i havent really read a charles dickens book before i was struck by his writing style its very poetic and grand compared to my usual reads it took some concentration to get into the style but soon i found myself reading the story we all know  i really did enjoy it sweet and fitting  though i never knew it was as short as it is  this was okay i think the story certainly has its charm and i can certainly see why it is considered a classic and why it has been so popular throughout the years nevertheless i really just cant seem to get along with dickens writing style happy i read the book because now i know what the fuss is about sadly it was not for me i just remembered i read this when i was like  i dont remember the book though i was just the kind of kid who would read the every book i found i dont like the english version because of the archaic language but it is normal  the story is written in th century ill try the bulgarian one an overall of two because the lack of information provided within the text dickens fails to inform the reader what is happening in the certain setting taking quizzes on it was extremely hard but this is coming from a middle schooler i got an  on the test because dickens failed in the places i relied on him most ugh every one knows what this story is about i personally have seen many many many adaptations of this book and now that ive read it im surprise to admit the original one is not very good it feels bland exaggerated and a bit hypocrite at times the only thing i enjoyed reading this book was the writing but thats about it yeah im not a classics person so its really not to my surprise that this book was not for me  but i didnt hate it which was good it dragged on a bit even though it was short but not too bad  i really think i am the wrong audience to review this as this isnt my sort of book but those are my unhelpful opinions so there you go i watched an animation version of this book two or three years ago and i really liked it sad thing that i rarely like a book that i have seen a movie of before this could have been a very enjoyable read two stars because i once enjoyed the movie well this was certainly a challenging and timeconsuming read for me im not sure id have persevered if i didnt have someone to talk it through with i feel like dickens chose to take the very longwinded route of saying things sometimes boy is it a good job he knew how to use punctuation properly or those long sentences would have killed me certain extracts could be particularly good for encouraging children to read for punctuation  theres no way they could make it through one sentence in one go  so this was my first time reading the novel i remember seeing scrooge as a west end production when i was about  and its always stuck in my mind i really enjoyed the story the whole idea of it is wonderful and unique a timeless tale however the novel itself was too much for me i tried to read little and often although the last stave i did in one sitting i found the language often quite difficult to understand and sometimes the description was endless i really benefited from the illustrations in this particular copy i would have struggled even more without them  dont get my wrong i do really like the story and so much can be learnt from it but unfortunately i didnt like the book itself so much sorry dickens  i did really like this incredibly powerful quote however  referring to christmas the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shutup hearts freely to think of people below them as if they were really fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys my first dickens i suppose  what can i say its the story that has been told over and over again mainly in christmas environment and as i understand they thosealreadyconsumedbymestories were all inspired by this story which i respect however i just didnt care i didnt care and the writing imo was a slog very redundant and i cant say that a lot of paragraphs were benificial to the story  what can you do you win some you lose some  at the end i can see that this one wasnt really for me but i can acknowledge its importance impact on todays christmas stories and originality at that time
"The Cat in the Hat (The Cat in the Hat, #1)",i never really read anything by dr seuss when i was younger only recently i read grinch and i just remember how ive always seen his books being mention in ya and wondered whats that about  and i still dont know why only two of his books were translated into czech if i can trust czech version of goodreads  anyway this was quite fun and quick read but the important question is if anyone ever did a horror version of the cat in the hat because its just asking for it isnt it he should not be here  he should not be about  he should not be here  when your mother is out  it was a tale hard to rate  and i imagine how shocked must be for many of you when you notice my stars rate  three stars for the cat in the hat the very tale that its an emblem about dr seuss work  well before calling the zooks and yooks to begin a war against me let me explain my personal struggles with the tale  while i like to think that i still have a young heart i cant deny that i am an adult and sometimes my adult mode entered in high alert and suspicion  we have a stranger adult person yes i know hes a cat but work with me who breaks into a private house without permission and offering to children to play with his things and while he cleans his mess most likely erasing any evidence to be used by the police you are left uncertain if the kids will tell their mother about the whole incident inciting to lie to parents  i dont know you but i found this quite creepy and id be worried if that dang cat would be left alone with my children  yes i know its dr seuss charming world of tales and the cat in the hat would never harm a kid but you wouldnt know that if this would happen in our messy world so i am left worrying about what kind of message can get kids out from this tale  trust in strangers with funny hats and dont tell truth to your parents  again its dr seuss and i am sure that he didnt want to give that message but since the cat in the hat became such popular character loved by many i wonder what was the expected role of this feline one when the story just got out  but just in case my personal clear message is kids stay in school dont do drugs and dont let strangers in your houses much less if youre alone and dont get up in their cars neither i cant get more clear than that geez  a relevant fact is that dr seuss wrote this book as his first one to help kids to learn how to read using only  words from the basic vocabulary used by children in the first grade of primary school  yes i know i was unfair with this tale but i couldnt deny my adult worries while reading it  by the way the fish is an unsung hero this was tongue tying too much so indy and i havent read many of these although he did ask for it off his brothers shelf i was stumbling over my words probably to try and get through it quickly this cat was too long made me feel tired hes still quite cool of course just not for us at this reading stage we have about ten others though on the shelf so hopefully we will embrace them a little more  stars my favorite dr seuss book as a kid i was very happy to be able to read this out loud with my five year old daughter and have her love it as much as i did i felt reading this suddenly it was so cute i liked it   i say that as a  year old girl so i guess if i read it as a kid i would like it very much the cat in the hat  in a wet and dull day sally and her brother found themselves stuck in the house with their wise fish and wondering about finding a way   to get rid of  that boredom suddenly  the cat in the hat appeared who was funny but a troublemaker he tried some of  his tricks to entertain the kids in the meantime the fish in the pot kept warning them from his gimmicks but they couldnt resist  the temptation of that cat because he showed them enjoyable games eventually he messed up their beautiful house  but the magical cat cleaned up every portion in their home in a trice before their mother comes home i picked  up this book because of its beautiful blue cover i will read any book with the same color regardless of its title  the plot was perfect for a child reader the language sounds pretty easy to understand highly recommended for kids  and for adults too why not   surely you will get a warm feeling among this book this childrens book was published in  the characters are the cat in the hat the children their mother the fish and thing one and thing two obviously the protagonist is the cat though actually all of them play a big role in this story i liked the colorful illustrations that are very important to attract kids attention while reading a book to them i admit i liked some other books by by dr seuss more after reading this with my childrens lit class im not sure how i feel about it as a childrens book its great entertainment it teaches a lesson as well stranger danger boredom taking responsibility and ownership the cats key words are fun funny and tricks at first the kids dont really do anythingtheir expressions are consistently astonished they have no agency until the fish finally convinces them to do something and then our appropriately unnamed narrator finally moves from passivity to action and resolves the problem it shows children that kids can solve problems that if their parents arent present and people are trying to get them to do things they dont want to do they can stop it they can take a stand and make a change on their own thats important  what i like most about this book though has little to do with the contents which honestly arent that interesting to me im not super impressed by the story or by the artwork although i have to admit that the story is creative i like that seuss drew political cartoons and worked on propaganda films during ww guess how the cat started out as a riff on uncle sam when pearl harbor was bombed seuss drew a cartoon version of uncle sam and the line was something about the us waking up from its cat nap so the fact that theres a subversive and manipulative cat in an uncle sam top hat trying to get these children to do things his way is extremely interesting you cant use an uncle sam cat in multiple political cartoons and then use that same cat in childrens books and tell me youre not implying something on a deeper level and that makes the cat interesting to me  i also love that seuss read comics and allowed them to influence his work the golden age of comics would have influenced him the most and we have those american superheros emerging at that time simple straightforward artwork with clean lines and a clear story i see that reflected in seusss work for sure we have these two allamerican kids who work hard to solve a problem and are successful despite setbacks and the american optimism comes into play at the end  finally we have another mother without a father peter rabbits dad died sally and her brother have no dad and in our current read in childrens lit where the wild things are max has no dad present my sister brings up the point that the kids are home in cat and wild things and they were published in  and  respectively so perhaps this was a dad is at work issue but its still strange we also never see sally and her brothers mom except her foot in one scene and her foot hand and part of her body in the final scene this is about childrens agency so that makes sense but its still weird that their mother leaves them alone on a rainy day for some reason and doesnt lock the door or tell them not to let strange cats into their home at least they have a fish babysitter but still  all in all this is an interesting book i would read it with my kids and let them ask questions and i would talk to them about letting strangers into our home and listening to your conscience via jiminy fishet and the ending where the narrator asks the reader if they would tell their mom the truth tell me the truth children even if its something i wont want to hear but if i let them read it on their own id hope they were entertained otherwise i wouldnt choose it its just okay as a kids book and im sure there are better seuss books that i just dont remember at my ripe old age  oh but id show my older kids and talk about the intricacies and complexities of the backstory and inspirations and things its much more fun to analyze than anything else i think  and side note my dad is cleaning out the attic and he found a bunch of my books and this was one of them i didnt know i had kept so many of my childhood books and im really happy that he found them my heart leapt lept leaped at the sight it was a fun read  growing up i read dr seuss often i always considered his the cat in the hat a five star classic i still enjoy it thoroughly however after reading it with a critics eye i was surprised what i found  in the book the mother of two small children left them home alone to fend for themselves on a rainy day if any two children were anything like me or my four siblings growing up that is a recipe for disaster it reflects poor parenting without any parental consequences this is simply unrealistic granted dr seuss books are far from realistic however it does not employ any sort of moral to the story further disobedience and potential danger are welcomed into the home through the cat in the hat although the fish who could serve as somewhat of a conscience disapproves immensely the cat comes in and destroys the house however by the time the mother gets home the cat has everything under control and leaves with a tip of his hat  having written all this i still enjoy the cat in the hat and see it as a classic in childrens literature however having viewed it from a critics perspective i was able to pick up on areas i had never really discovered before we love dr seuss but this isnt one of their favorite seusss if they had to choose instead going for the grinch or horton before pulling this one off the shelf however its still a seuss with the same old lovable rhyming and colorful illustrations its still one weve read several times we jokingly refer to my  yr old twins as thing  and thing  and might even dress them up for halloween that way a great addition to any collection okay heres the thing these kids are at home alone they seem like good kids then out of nowhere blam insane ginormous cat bursts through the door uninvited and wreaks havoc  let me be clear this is not okay if i was a character in this book i would be the fish without a doubt  i enjoyed reading this short story it is written for children by very simple sentences and very easy words but that doesnt mean adults cant like it i liked especially the poetry writing style which is admirably musical  the cat in the hat  the story strangely so relevant i think for every kidparents not at home letting a stranger in the house things the kids shouldnt do but the story changed the end as if it is not a big deal would have enjoyed much more as a child   this was a gift to my niece on her birthday and since i happened to be there and was curious to know what this much encountered classic title was about borrowed it and finished it in a sitting  not a great feat it being a childrens book short of  pages shall ask for her opinion once shes done with it so as to know things from a fresher perspective chilling and amusing account of a sociopathic cat with a flair for millinery and the dramatic who takes two small children hostage before proceeding to destroy their home in a serious of macabre games fans of korean cinema will enjoy the parasitemeetssquidgames vibe but personally i found the cats relentless gaslighting grinding by the end which his last page heroics did little to atone for  im aware this is a childrens book but i read it in hebrew and it took about  hours and i also have  books to read in  days to reach my annual target so i am counting it oh dear said the cat you do not like our game    oh dear what a shame what a shame what a shame a classic this edition had a few pages of history regarding this tale and how it came about at the beginning this is what parents should be entertaining their kids with each night before beddy byes in dr seusss stories you dont need characters plot a problem and its solution or an idea to communicate it all you need is tenderness warmth and affection and cold of a winters night or rain like this here to go on a journey to your childhood after a nice experience with this writer i wanted to repeat but it wasnt quite how the grinch stole christmas maybe this is more for kids but still readable and entertaining reminds me again of childhood in the last century its warm too and im looking forward to another meet with him soon this book is nothing but a frustration george frequently chooses it from our shelf and hands it to me but i dont know if hes ever lasted long enough for us to be introduced to thing one and thing two i really hate the movie but this one was funny  and then something went bump how that bump made us jump we looked then we saw him step in on the mat we looked and we saw him the cat in the hat somehow i managed to grow through childhood without ever reading a book by dr seuss that seems pretty unbelievable but i honestly dont remember reading anything by him or even in that style when i was in my twenties and living aupair with a family who had a yearold girl i put her to bed and she insisted that i read this to her just about every night usually more than once i didnt appreciate the rhythm and rhyme until many years later  i didnt care for the story but im not the target audience tanya loved it and thats what upped my rating oddly i dont think i ever read this as a child i am not sure how so many of these popular childrens books passed me by or maybe it was read to me and i just dont remember my daughter received this book for christmas so i just read it aloud to her nice rhymes cute story we both enjoyed it this might have been the first book i ever read it was one of the first but i always liked one fish two fish red fish blue fish better and there are far superior dr seuss books published after these were available to me as a young kid my god all i cared about was that i felt sorry for the cat but its a rather enjoyable read anyways  if i were in this story i would be like the goldfish yeah im a downer lol liked this one though the cat was like super annoying this is everything i expect from cats tbh and this is why i dont like cats when i was little i watched the movie but this is my first time reading the cat in the hat for some reason i felt anxious the whole time reading it i also remember having that same feeling while watching the movie this is one of those books ive heard about all my life and never read a friend mentioned it and said she didnt like it because the cat was creepy surely i wouldnt feel the same way i thought i wonder what i would have thought about this book without being jaded by her response to the a strange man the cat in the hat waltzing in when  kids parents arent home and wreaking havoc on their house i suppose the ending leaves an opening to explain to kids that you dont invite strangers inside when your parents are away from home and that if you do that you tell your parents what happened once they get back home right  my mom never let us read dr seuss as a child i never understood why then again there were probably more books on the list of forbidden than allowed books so i never really questioned it now that im reading him for the first time im finding myself on the fence about whether i like him or not these books are definitely quirky and creative the rhymes are great tools for teaching reading ive used them even when tutoring adults who were learning to read i think that what really gets me is that many of them are just a little  off they can be read innocently or not so innocently read innocently theyre great fun read notsoinnocently they could be horror stories or dirty books fox in socks is one that seems to be full of double entendre but thats a story for another day  ps does your cat in the hat speak in a fake british accent mine does
The Outsiders,the last time i read this novel was back in th grade i honestly didnt remember much past stay golden ponyboy so i was going into this reread with some questions  that being said im a little surprised that our required reading mentioned sex drugs and alcohol i wish i remembered the discussions we had with this novel although i doubt most of my class read the whole thing i do remember they had us watch the movie after reading it which most of my class was more excited for  the narration of this skims very surface level it felt authentic that a  year old was describing what happened because often times he would say contradictory things or im not sure why we did that why that happened etc i wish there was just a bit more depth to the story as it would have taken it to the next level  overall this was a quick read but i didnt enjoy it similar to how i felt  years ago it was hard for me and my classmates to relate to ponyboys situation but i can see how this novel might resonate more with others who feel as alienated and misunderstood in todays society the whole thing seemed a little dated a throwback to the days like the sixties and seventies when old folks would see longhaired youths in dirty blue denims and see them as monsters until someone pointed out they helped old ladies across the road and read poetry so we have these poor greasers all set to rumble with the rich socs of course it is that kind of tough gang war world but really as we find out they would rather read gone with the wind recite poetry and admire each others hair yeah i remain unconvinced if i had children however i would certainly call them sodapop and ponyboy just to toughen them up a little for summer reading we had to read this book i probably wouldve read it anyway required or not because so many people were raving about how great of a ya book it was what i was then subject to was about twohundred pages of utterly delayed epiphanies and ingenuous prose maybe its merely because of the young protagonist but honestly it was more than a bit of a stretch  the outsiders details the conflicts of an adolescent named ponyboy as he achieves maturity and tries to find his way among the street gangs of his hometown from an objective standpoint the outsiders is just a preposterously weak novel in the place of the jolting grittiness necessary to carry the violence and toughness we have artless prose that is bland and unrevealing these emotional scenes are full of anguish because the book itself wants this and because of the natural human reaction to violence and death hinton doesnt really convey the real wrenching heartfelt sentiment behind these events so here we are with a completely expressionless book that is basically just a shopping list of incidents that happens throughout ponyboys youth  sometimes its difficult to see if the novel has any sort of emotional attachment to its own characters when johnnys past is finally revealed and the other greasers show up after he was attacked all they do is sit around spewing sympathetic remarks johnnys harrowing ordeal becomes just a reason for some conversing among the characters he becomes nothing more than a specimen to be measured and observed then tossed away as other matters build up through the novel  these are issues faced with dally too he is dangerous because the novel itself says he is rather than he himself demonstrating any real rebellious characteristics other than the matter with the policeman these characters really just lack individuality as a whole  these teenagers fail also fail horribly to see the most blatant meanings behind the situations in which they find themselves in the last couple of pages we get insight after insight as ponyboy finally puts everything together and sees the meaning behind everything yes ponyboy finally understands a little more about darry because of a little family tiff then both of them finally understand something about sodapop and his anxieties to fit in with the family the slapdash job of shoehorning all of these epiphanies and thoughts into one confused tangle of ideas make them all incredibly shallow and unconvincing  with these thoughts in mind i gave it a twostar rating not really because of any redeeming qualities in particular but really just because its a far cry better than a lot of the other paranormal ya books  a final thought most people believe that all of these issues are justified by saying hinton was so young when she wrote this though  well yeah you can tell you have to read this book when youre in middle school otherwise theres no point somewhere between good and okayish so  rounded down couldnt help but imagine it as a bollywood blockbuster of s featuring ponytail as mithun da sodapop as govinda and darry as sanjay dutt i interrupted the reading and had to make an effort to go on i guess i insisted due to the memory of the movie still its kind of depressing taking a toll on my emotional state  first and foremost i understand and am truly impressed by the fact se hinton was only  or  when she wrote this story although i cant factor that into my review because then it becomes a question of should i be considering all authors experience when reviewing  so in a nutshell the outsiders is a supposedly touching drama about young orphan ponyboy curtis who has grown up as a member of what we are told is a violent gang the greasers who are engaged in social class warfare ponyboy spends the story coming to terms with the fact that the prejudice he has for the rival gang the socs and his own prejudices about his role in his gang may not be what he thought  i know this book is a beloved nostalgic treasure to a lot of people and i genuinely dont want to take that away from anyone i know i wouldnt want that done for me and certain books i had to read in high school that i ended up loving despite knowing now they may not have been that profound but that is my issue with the outsiders or rather how it has always been presented to me i just think that if you were to strip away the lets be real sexy and glamorous greaser aesthetic it isnt saying anything that profound the message is to understand that people may have reasons for being the way they are and thats truly fine but i just found it quite surface level  i should give an example the whole point of the story antiprejudice etc isnt shown to us through any particular event but rather told outright right at the start by the notlove interest ill bet you think the socs have it made the rich kids the westside socs ill tell you something ponyboy and it may come as a surprise we have troubles youve never even heard of you want to know something she looked me straight in the eye things are rough all over yeah big events happen but they dont do anything to show how the socs are troubled or how they are actually like the greasers they are just conflicts for the sake of conflict there is a completely inconsequential interaction with a wellmeaning soc towards the end but only well after its already established that ponyboy understands the lesson  the gang itself isnt what id expect from an underprivileged gang in s oklahoma they are all pretty emotional and supportive of each other even in their softer moments soft hearted members in a violent gang isnt a problem but it does undercut ponyboy being insecure about how emotional he is why should he or us care if he cries or something if the gang are super supportive about it if they had a we love you but grow some balls type of mentality i think it would help us believe they are a dangerous lot  to finish on a positive the best and only part of the book that gave me an emotional response was the relationship between ponyboy and his oldest brother darry darry could have been a soc but due to the loss of their parents he was thrown financially and socially into the lowerclass greasers that is what should have been the focus of the story if the purpose was to show the similarities between social classes and the futile nature of prejudice dont come  me but i didnt like the outsiders  i read it in th grade and idk i just didnt like it that much might be due for a reread but idk  i used to hate the books they made us read in school i was a picky reader back then still kind of am maybe i was too immature to read the outsiders at the time i read it and just didnt put the meaning of the book in depth i think i might give it another chance well see saw the movie that was based on this book years ago but never saw it through to the end so i always wanted to read the book to find out what happened to ralph macchios character the film has some big stars patrick swayze matt dillon karate kid ralph emilio estevez rob lowe and that scientologist guy who had a nose job once p but its a real teen movie watching it as an adult youd probably get bored pretty quickly the book has the same effect i found myself as an adult reading it getting bored with the lax style my eyes glazing over i kept wanting to skim passages especially in the middle of the book because a lot of it seemed like throwaway stuff  in this book one teen gang greasers vs other teen gang socs in the s greasers are the poor kids socs are the rich kids what the book tries to show but doesnt do it successfully enough imo is that both sides have the same problems more or less i dont think thats true though the book is narrated by one of the kids largely about going on the run with his friend johnny greaser dont wanna go into too much detail and spoil the story which is fairly good  the writing is spare expressing emotions consists mostly of people being wideeyed or bigeyed with shock etc  i still enjoyed the book but the problem i had with it and with the film is the effeminate way in which the boys were acting around each other but only because i dont think its realistic the greasers would sleep in each others laps etc and i know boys just dont act that way with each other especially not in gangs where there is a macho culture maybe the writer wanted us to see the greasers as sensitive but i didnt think that was it i couldnt figure out why the kids in the book and film were acting this way until i discovered when i looked the writer up that it was written by a woman then it hit me ive seen groups of girls acting this way around each other  beyond a certain age i think youd find this book a bit simplistic unpopular opinion timethis book is just not that great in the light of all the hype it was written by a clearly gifted year old but it was written by a year old and it shows i think its a bit dated as well i dont know it just didnt float my boat as an adult reader  and i read it in middle school and can barely remember reading it then i recognize it for being one of the first true ya novels and for the skill of the writer given her age i also understand why so many adolescents like it and even why we teach it but  its not my cup of tea and i dont plan on teaching it again  read this for class in th grade and while it wasnt a horrible book i remember being thoroughly unimpressed by it while my friends fawned over it the characters just didnt strike anything with me and i really just couldnt relate in all honesty i can see why this is such a popular book and im impressed the author wrote it at the age she did while i didnt love it or find it groundbreaking i thought it was a good solid read i think im the only one who hates this book i know i gave it  stars please dont kill me  a lot of people really liked this book but tbh i found it really boring and i was only reading it for school i mean it was kinda sad when johnny and dally died but i didnt really have a connection with the characters and it didnt really affect me emotionally  sorry guys the story was simple but well written in places i would of liked more plot twist and surprises but it became very predictable it was obviously written by a woman because she kept on describing all the boys as handsome good looking film stars which got on my nerves surely theres more to a young mans character then his looks i gave it  stars because i felt if it was written again the storyline could have been deeper and more interesting i had to read this for school i think it tried to be deep but it kinda failed but its okay  west side story   brians song   soap opera any one  the outsiders  early in the book the author does a very good job of capturing teen angst and those ever present feelings of not belonging and that everybody else has it better than you do as the action picks up and the drama unfolds the story descends into endless mawkishness  if i had read this book in my teen years it would probably hold strong sentimental value but as an adult i was simply glad it was a quick read ill have to reread shane by jack schaefer i read it in my teens and truly loved it i wonder if itll seem comically cheesy to me today maybe i wont read it again why spoil something you love  i think this is a good book for early teens because it can speak to them effectively but the dated language could be a bit of a turnoff for adults who like really sentimental literature this is also a good choice i wouldnt say that this is a book i enjoyed because i did not i skimmed through most because the plot just didnt seem that engaging to me  yeah i like sodapops character he seems like a nice guy but they are just too shallow all of them there isnt any history to them and they arent dimensional  there were so many things that didnt add up together was there a connect between their parents death and the soc fighting with them what happened to cherry what happened to johnnys parents to sandy cute i wasnt the most engaged during the first sector but in the end everything kind of tied together i liked the portrayal of life decades ago in oklahoma and what it feels like to be a pariah as well as the lengths one would go to protect someone else and how sometimes that goes overlooked cute but just mediocre just not my cup of tea personal response i did not like the outsiders that much i thought it was boring and dragged on for a while that was not necessary there was irrelevant parts in the book that we did not really need to know i also did not like how cringy it was another reason i did not like it because it was based in the s which was not relatable and boring to read one of the only good things about this book was that it was fun to make fun of also that the author wrote it in high school was cool overall i did not enjoy this book that much  plot summary the book the outsiders takes place in tulsa oklahoma during the s the book is told through one of the main characters ponyboy curtis ponyboy lives on the east side of town with his brothers darry and sodapop while the socs live on the west side of town and are very rich they are a part of a gang called greasers with other boys around darry and sodapops ages the greasers have a bad reputation that is not completely deserved everyone thinks they cause all the fights troubles and steal ponyboy also is not a normal greaser he does not like fights johnny who is one year older then ponyboy also is close with ponyboy and have the same interests as ponyboy ponyboy was with johnny one night and accidentally fell asleep in the lot near their house and got home in the middle of the night that did not make darry happy at all darry was really worried and was angry with ponyboy so much he started yelling at him and eventually slapped him across the face which caused ponyboy to run back to the lot where he fell asleep with johnny they decided to go on a walk and ran into a few socs that were drunk and picking a fight they try running away from them but got caught and one of the socs tried killing ponyboy johnny tried saving ponyboy by stabbing the soc but end up killing him ponyboy and johnny did not know what to do so they went to dally another greaser for help dally told them to an abandoned church on a hill in small town far from them they listened to dally and went they also got a gun and money from him to buy food and defend themselves johnny and ponyboy arrived to the church and went to sleep right away while ponyboy was sleeping johnny went and bought some food and hair dye to disguise themselves they spent a lot of time at the church alone eventually dally came to check on them and they left the church when they returned to the church it was on fire and little kids were trapped inside johnny and ponyboy decided to go in the church to save them ponyboy got out but johnny was trapped inside and got seriously hurt and dally decided to go in and get johnny out they were all rushed to the hospital and treated the rest of the greasers went and went to the hospital to see them johnny had the worst injuries of the three and was not expected to live while they were in the hospital some of the greasers decided to have a rumble with some of the socs to settle if the socs are aloud in the east side anymore they had the rumble and dally escaped out of the hospital to go and fight with the other greasers once the rumble was done ponyboy and dally went to the hospital to visit johnny when they got there johnny as not in good shape and ended up passing away there and dally did not take it well at all and ended doing bad things which led to the cops chasing him he ended up in the lot and the rest of the greasers were there and something bad happened ponyboy ended up getting really sick and had to go back to the hospital was sleeping for a few days ponyboy was not himself afterwards and was doing bad in school and had fights with darry again sodapop ended up helping them with their problems and ponyboy was himself again  recommendation i would recommend this book to high schoolers because it has relevant problems that high schoolers face during high school also there are quite a bit of violence in this book that i think middle schoolers would not be able to handle another thing is there is some slang in this book that i think middle schoolers would not be able to understand at their age this book is a good book for high schoolers because they would be able to relate to some of the problems in the book to their lives i was so disappointed by this book it felt like an infrastructure that was hurriedly built and ended up being lackluster due to the unnecessary rush  i get that its ya so of course its not going to be a massive book but i couldnt understand why it was told so quickly it felt underdeveloped to the point that the scenes where there should have been an emotional punch were just meh i didnt feel anything remotely like empathy for the characters because i didnt have time to fall in love with them  another issue i had was that the work felt as though it were written without one ounce of research im not an expert on gangs but to me it felt slapdash like the story was written without picking up one book to read about gangs everything about it seemed madeup and unrealistic maybe the outsiders is a good representation of gangs i wouldnt know but as a reader it just felt extremely cartoonish to me and i had a hard time seeing the characters as anything but poorly written expectations that the author had about gangs  so overall  the plot was minimal the characters were blank sketches that desperately needed to be filled in more and the language itself was not very creative or engaging im giving the book two stars only because it had a lot of potential and it wasnt like it was actually painful to read just disappointing this was my second read the first was when i was  or  and my mom tried to get me to read all of se hintons books she loved them as a kid however i was more into sweet valley so i have no memory of hintons novels ask me anything about jessica and elizabeth wakefield though when i saw this book available online i thought to give it another try unfortunately it just fell flat i realize i have difficulty with characters unrelatable to my own life but even the story which seemed like a west side story parody didnt hold my interest i had no empathy for johnny or dallas i found ponyboy a tiresome narrator and the devices murder fire gang rumbles were of no consequence perhaps this makes me callous as three people died but i didnt feel for those characters ill still reread her other books  but im not expecting to love them the way elizabeth loved todd then jeffrey then todd again this is a book that id been meaning to read for a while id heard so many great things about it and unfortunately for me it just didnt live up to the hype i know that one of the reasons so many people love the book is that they find it relatable but i just didnt  i think a major part of the problem for me is that although i was a bit of an outcast in school it wasnt anywhere near the level of ponyboy and the greasers in the whole scheme of things my lifestyle was more in line with the socs even though i didnt fit in with the popular kids but the book doesnt really show us things from the soc perspective but even if it did i still dont think id have found the story all that relatable  loved the interactions between these boys they all have distinctive personalities and i was hooked on their character arcs that being said thats pretty much where my interest stopped the plot wasnt really to my liking because it was basically like watching a bunch of guys fight and get hurt over and over again i would also say that the female characters personalities were aggressively mediocre making the book not very compelling to read for me the outsiders is a strange book for a teen classicit feels like adults marveled at the quality of the teenage writers work and thought teens would relate to it and it became a classic almost out of inertia a story of class conflict between greasers and socs or upper middle class suburbanites the outsiders is extremely prosaic and the characters are very hard to believe in supposedly a tale of tough bluecollar gang members the characters call each other dear and honey read each other bedtime stories hug cry constantly show off their muscles to each other and otherwise behave in ways that read as absurd for teenage male culture its kind of sweet as a fantasy but given the crumby plotting i have the sense that this book is esteemed for its grittiness and realism which it just doesnt seem to have on top of all of this there is a gentle undercurrent of neoconfederate rubbish in the book including idolizing of gone with the wind and discussion of southern gentlemen which is pretty foul when taken with the extreme whiteness of the characters and plotting  the outsiders is a wobbly  stars for me and id say this should be a firm miss for most readers i have no idea why this book is taught in schools and regarded as a classic i didnt enjoy reading it it was really slow to start and had a fast pace throughout considering that the author was  when she wrote it and it was written in the s it could have been worse some people really enjoyed it though which i dont really understand you can read it if you want or dont i dont care nothing about this book is believable but i get why teenagers loved it the characters make no sense they are supposed to be a bad ass gang of boys but they are obsessed with their hair read gone with the wind snuggle in bed and do gymnastics before a rumble and im also convinced that steve and soda were gay dont try to convince me otherwise 
One Hundred Years of Solitude,one hundred years of solitude is an absolute groundbreaking book it is intelligent creative and full of powerful anecdotal wisdom it deservedly won the noble prize for literature but how enjoyable is it how readable is it  gabriel garca mrquez plays around with reality itself he plays around with the limitations of fiction he uses elements of magic of the fantastic to give voice to things that could never be said quite as effectively in normal terms he breaks through realism and establishes his own original style he did nothing short of launching a new mode of literary address magical realism he wasnt the first writer to do such a thing though his writing was the first to attract criticism which in effect allowed for it to be defined and recognised  for me the strongest element of the book resides in its inherent pessimism with its unfortunate understanding that history can and will repeat itself all good intentions go awry indeed one hundred years of solitude challenges the progress or lack thereof of society it creates a selfcontained history in its isolated framework which arguably reflects the nature of mankind or at least it echoes columbian history with its liberal history in the face of imperialism no matter how much we want to change the world or how much we believe in a revolution or a new political ideal these good intentions often become warped when faced with the horrors of war and bloodshed nothing really changes  theres no denying the success of mrquezs epic theres no denying its ingenuity i really enjoyed parts of the novel but it was awfully difficult to read uncomfortably so the prose is extremely loose and free flowing to the point where it feels like thought its like a torrent of verbal diarrhoea that feels like it will never end characters die eerily similar characters take their place within the story and the narrative continues until the well has completely run dry of any actual life it is pushed so terribly far one hundred years to be precise  and thats my biggest problem im a sentimentalist i like to feel when i read i like to be moved either to anger or excitement i want to invest in the characters i want to care about their lives and i want to be provoked by their actions mrquezs approach meant that this was impossible to do so its a huge story told in just a few hundred pages its sweeps across the lives of the characters some exceedingly important characters in the story are introduced and die a very short time after to establish the sheer futility of human existence and effort mrquez tried to demonstrate  mrquez writes against european tradition and the legacy of colonialism he creates something totally new which is becoming increasingly hard to do although i do appreciate this novel i did not enjoy reading it as much as i could have done i suppose if your taste runs to jrr tolkien and carlos castaneda this would be a book for you but mine doesnt and this isnt i prefer james joyce and carl jung i understand marquezs metaphorical recapitulation of the history of latin america his articulation of the repetitiveness of human folly over generations his recognition of the dangers of human inquiry and technological progress his appreciation of the dialectical quality of things like ambition masculine strength sex and family life but i am still left unimpressed and unaffected by the result  for me the various jose arcadia buendias and their homophonic relatives are like hobbits they operate in the world in a permanent state of awed surprise  slackjawed and glassyeyed they lack the ability for introspective reflection and so bumble from one crisis to the next but never confront the inimical content of themselves with any awareness theyd rather be at home but only when theyre away from it consequently there is no tension of development of discovery but merely the flatness of yet another unnecessary familial trial that leads nowhere except to further obsession and avoidable grief after all at least joyces bloom and homers ulysses have moments of personal insight or revelation in contrast marquezs jabs seem obstinately obtuse  like any other parabolic myth one hundred years satisfies many interpretations even contradictory ones the world of the inquiring intellect vs the world of the participative human being personal ambition vs communal duty power and its conceits the sources of tribal identity etc but for me these possibilities dont lead to anything more meaningful than the opportunity presented by a telephone book to ring up any number of strangers i find nothing larger to which such things point the various jabs are fatally fascinated solely by what presents itself in front of them i think i would prefer the story of marquezs gypsy seer melquiades who had an asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of things but marquez doesnt say anything else about what that might be hmm i finally read this after years of putting it off and i confess that i was a little underwhelmed  stylistically i think its quite beautiful i love the way marquez describes the setting and the time in question  it makes for an extremely quotable book the imagery is woven in with the human interactions to create a sense of that socalled magical realism that extends beyond the explicitly supernatural he dug so deeply into her sentiments that in search of interest he found love because by trying to make her love him he ended up falling in love with her petra cotes for her part loved him more and more as she felt his love increasing and that was how in the ripeness of autumn she began to believe once more in the youthful superstition that poverty was the servitude of love both looked back then on the wild revelry the gaudy wealth and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude madly in love after so many years of sterile complicity they enjoyed the miracle of living each other as much at the table as in bed and they grew to be so happy that even when they were two wornout people they kept on blooming like little children and playing together like dogs  however the story about the many generations of the buenzia family is more than a little messy most of the time it reads like a random incoherent stream of events and only translates into greater meaning when you study the novels symbolism  i think the two major themes of this novel  repetition of history and the fine line between reality and the supernatural  are explored much better by books like wuthering heights which while complex doesnt give its readers a headache but does include similar elements the appearance of ghosts multiple generations with similar names history repeating itself etc i do understand that one hundred years of solitude gives it a unique spin with particular regard to latin american history though  my final point probably invites some insults to my intelligence but here it is i think this book is very easy to appreciate and very difficult to like its fine even important for certain books to require extra effort from the reader but i also kind of agree with adams comment ill put it this way i dont like this book for the same reason that i never took up smoking if i have to force myself to like it whats the point my experience with gabriel garca mrquez so far  love in the time of cholera and one hundred years of solitude have not been my favorite reading experiences i feel that i did enjoy one hundred years of solitude more but in general i do not think his writing is for me however this does not discredit in anyway the writing and story  and i can very easily see why some people like his writing and why it is considered a classic  i am sure people want an explanation of why i cannot give mrquez and his books a glowing review mainly i just think the subject matter and style are not for me while i usually enjoy magical realism the way that he tells his various stories only gets me truly invested  of the time the rest of the time i tend to be either bored andor confused often i find myself revisiting sections to make sure i understood what i had just experienced with that being said i did find myself more invested and interested in this book over cholera  is that because it is a better book or because i knew better what i was getting into i am not sure  this book is worth a try if you want an interesting atmospheric genrespecific historical fiction story i hope that description makes sense    it made sense to me in my mind also it is worth trying if you are collecting the classics but if you are looking for an exciting or riveting read i think chances are low that you will find it here can you appreciate a book and dislike it at the same time this book reminded me of lincoln at the bardo although certainly not in content both are written by obviously brilliant writers both are inventive creative both stretch the conventional boundaries of the novel something only great writers try and something i appreciate in any art form both are amazing and yet i didnt love either book sometimes originality works and sometimes it doesnt at least for some  i understood what marquez was saying war is senseless events like names repeat throughout history families are complicated political parties are all guilty of the same things the past often blends with the present progress often has unwanted results capitalism can be corrupt and on and on these are all important aspects in the history of colombia during the  year period  i also think the author intentionally wanted the characters to be blurry for after all werent they the same characters through the generations only the matriarch was a player with depth i need to feel something for characters not necessarily compassion or love just something   years of solitude might have been palatable if i had known the history of colombia during that time period but even so it was repetitious yawn producing i often groaned as i picked it back up it was like being in a fevered dream bizarre events with moments of clarity  am i glad i read it yes did i enjoy parts especially the humorous parts yes im actually fonder of it the farther i get away from the drudgery of reading it did i enjoy the experience no i am just thankful marquez didnt write  years of solitude magical realism colourful columbian family saga complicated by the fact that each generation uses the same names as the previous and there are numerous extramarital relationships offspring raised by others and some complicated mildlyincestuous and underage relationships too intriguing aspect re insomnia disease leading to memory loss this book went from  to  to  stars it went from brilliant  zany to unique  amusing to overworked  predictable magical realismthe sine qua non of gabriel garcia marquez the archetype the empyreal novel that pioneered the outburst of this type of south american writing i would not reread this novel but i would recommend it to all who savor the radial expanse of genre in literature to be considered a comprehensive reader at lifes end you will had to have read magical realism and one hundred years of solitude won the nobel prize  ofttimes you experience works of art just to be exposed to something culture holds worthy no matter the medium music painting literature dance theater technology begin soapboxso you dont like western movies you still need to watch unforgiven the best movie of the year  so you dont like broad brush strokes you still need to see in person a flower painted by van gogh so you dont like th century plays you still need to see enacted the vicious realism of eugene oneals a long days journey into night so you dont like rocknroll you still need to listen to the perfect album by guns and roses appetite for destruction you dont like warfare you still need to take a tour of a nimitzclass aircraft carrier considered the most complicated man made structure ever so you dont like jazz you stillget the pointend soapbox  one hundred years of solitude needs to be experienced then put back on the library rack youve just been exposed to something the literary world holds worthy it may not have been exactly my taste like garcia marquezs  star love in the time of cholera but it was worthwhile in all its strangeness  strangeness how to define what i consider a strange novel let me try a visual representation or a visual transcription of how i would draw this novel why you ask well why the hell not  contour drawingalso known as continuousline drawing is an artistic technique used in the field of art in which the artist sketches the contour of a subject by drawing continuous lines that result in a drawing that is contorted andor abstracted wikipedia contorted and abstracted thats the key contour drawing is a type of art that uses one single line without lifting the pen from the paper thereby creating a visual effect that is sometimes representative sometimes complex and sometimes contorted andor abstracted blind contour drawing a subset is done without ever looking at the paper until the subject is complete and is usually even more contorted andor abstracted  to me marquez was creating a literary version of contour drawing one hundred years of solitude has the rudimentary look and feel of a novel its got all the right components an epic story that follows  years of the buendia family in the remote town of macondo columbia i believe marquez sat at his typewriter wrote the first sentence took about  coffee breaks but didnt stop until  pages later with the last sentence the story is a single line never lifted from the paper  i dont think magical realism needs to be edited its a nonstop bruteforce narrative that keeps pushing forward relentlessly interminably without a slack in pace but this is not to say that the story is perfectly chronological it isnt instead like contour drawing one hundred years of solitude is pages full of overlapping spirals and squiggles that keep moving slightly to the right so that theres intersecting lines in a rhythmic doodle always moving forward but causing us to cross through previous story over and over again repeatedly but never edited a single line you move forward in time then move back in time forward and back in circles its a brilliant  zany technique that captures the same kind of storyline fable your grandmother may have told you when you were  anythings possible in magical realism but if you slow down and question the finer points then you lose the bigger picture consequently the story has a breathless quality its almost as if grandma slows down and thinks about the subject shes covered then she will have lifted the pencil from the paper and she will have lost her way unable to recover any sense of the story the magic will have dissipated  so the story was pretty decent but after a couple hundred pages the breathless righthanded overlapping spirals of storyline became overworked as if every time grandma took a sip from her white wine pushing way past bedtime you could tell exactly how the story was about to continue not what the story was going to be or what words were going to come from her mouth but you could tell closely how she was going to say it  i recommend you read one hundred years of solitude in the largest installments you can if you read it over several weeks or only a few pages at a time you will absolutelyi guaranteelose the gist youll find yourself going back and trying to figure out which of the  jose arcadios or  aurelianos the story is discussing and in which spiral i had a permanent bookmark on page  that outlined the family genealogy i fear that giving anything less than a full five stars to gabriel garcia marquezs magnum opus is to invite the ire of the entirety of the goodreads community upon my head with that said i think that one hundred years of solitude is a close as you can get to a perfect novel those statements may seem fairly contradictory so let me explain  one hundred years of solitude is not an easy read but it certainly is a beautiful one marquezs prose is crafted with such care that anyone would be a fool to suggest he is anything less than a master of language whats more the hundred years over which this novel transpires are filled with characters who live a wide swath of human experience there is love romance sorrow violence academia humour and much more represented within these  pages though the dialogue throughout is fairly sparse maconodo is brought to vivid life through not only the physical description of the town but through the enterprises schemes and people who live in the swamps of colombia a quick visit to the books wikipedia page let me know that this novel has been the subject of academic interest which comes as no surprise after having finished my read  but heres the thing this book can be a real challenge to follow no sentence is without meaning and characters can drop out of the book by sudden death or disappearance in a single sentence the naming which i am sure many fellow goodreaders have noted are generational variations on jose arcadio aureliano amaranta ursula etc though i had a pretty good grip on the genealogy for the first half of the book i became confused somewhere along the way i had to frequently turn to the family tree at the front of the book to try and parse out which aureliano i was reading about note at one point there are  aurelianos running about maconodo one of the things i really did enjoy is that this novel also fits well in my  goal to read more international authors this book is like no other ive read and was a welcome distraction from the canadiana ive been reading lately  with that said the confusing nature of the book the allegories the metaphors and sheer depth of the books meaning make it the ideal candidate for a reread i read this in a tandem read with one of my friends and i kept reflecting that this is the type of book i wish i had read for a university course ill fully admit to thinking i was coming close to understanding the greatness of this novel only to realize that i had been missing the forrest for the trees  ive read acclaimed books that i had no taste for and ive read acclaimed books that ive really enjoyed one hundred years of solitude occupies some nebulous area in the middle as i enjoyed parts but felt unable to get a handle on its greatness much like salman rushdies midnights children one hundred years of solitude is a book i think ill enjoy more on my second read through  so thats the review i now lay myself at the mercy of my goodreads friends be gentle i finished this and explained to my girlfriend that it was great even though i dont really know what happened in it or to whom and it moved pretty slowly and she was like well why then do you think it was great and ive been trying to answer that i mean i know but its one thing to know and another thing to know how to say it  but sometimes you read something where the authors perspective is so different and valuable that you feel like its spawned a new part of your brain youll carry that perspective with you in some nebulous mostly subconscious way from now on sometimes that actually is overt  like something will happen years later and youll recall an incident from one book or another that sheds some kind of light on your situation but more often i think you dont really put your finger on it its just there now  this book is cool cool in a way love in the time of cholera my only other marquez isnt it has the weight of myth which also means its not exactly a pageturner i dont really know what the plot is and although i kept track of the characters while i was reading it im certainly not going to now but its cool so maybe i wont spend too much time trying to figure out exactly why its so cool or what specifically it did for me  cease cows life is short  eta years later sometimes you think a books going to grow on you and sometimes youre wrong with hindsight this was boring and i dont remember any of it its not that i disagree with anything i wrote above  its just that it turns out i dont really care im downing it to three stars this book started really well and i was enjoying the magical realism and the quirky characters in fact i enjoyed more than half of it but then i started to feel weighed down by the sheer number of characters and the absolute density of the text it required more concentration than the reward i was getting and i eventually gave up on page  basically for me it was just too long although i can fully understand why so many people love it perhaps i needed to be in a different mood it was too long and i lost the point somewhere in the first hundred pages if there was one the language was cool however and the town was magical in its own way maybe  a dense and beguiling read i loved ursula but a lot of the other characters washed over me im glad ive read it but i felt quite distanced from the narrative found this book so hard to read thats all i can say about i didnt finish it i gave up halfway through after a second chance of reading this i feel a little bit different  i actually finished it  theres a surprise ending  eventually the parchment with the strange language is translated and reveals a lot more than the buendias family expect originally i decided to include this as a family saga and for a book of  pages it is compared to other family sagas which can stretch to near  pages or more some even divided into three or more books for such a short book theres a lot going on its called one hundred years of solitude for a reason  this was my first mrquez book and i will hopefully read more at some point mrquezs writing is dense and challenging at times predominantly for the reason that you have to pay a great deal of attention to what you are reading at any given point paragraphs are long and feel without break and each chapter is crammed to the brim with more and more information the ending was surprising and exciting after what had felt like quite a slowburning read for the majority of the novel  one thing that i didnt love about this book was the naming conventions of the characters i would have been lost without the family tree supplied at the beginning of the book  male and female characters are named after each other repeatedly to the point where i found it quite hard to follow who i was reading about at any given point i got used to this after a while but still found myself flipping back to the family tree at multiple points throughout the novel even within the last one hundred pages  the concept of this novel was very interesting although it did have its repetitive moments unsurprising considering the patterns of family life depicted there were some moments where i was completely locked into the storyline and particular characters who i lived to follow sections to do with warfare however did not interest me as much the latter portion of the novel definitely picked up for me in comparison with the slow start and im glad i persevered  im not sure if this is the best place to start with mrquezs writing as its the only book of his that i have read so far however it definitely is worth the time putting into it even though i didnt love it i still feel like ive been through a real literary experience reading it i have to say this book about buendia family and their various fortunes and misfortunes is pretty difficult to get through but if one can manage to not confuse all the jose arcadios and aurelianos they are in for a treat from the jose who establishes the town of macondo to the aureliano who finally manages to decipher the family manuscript left back by a gypsy all the characters have a vibrant story to tell civil war to massacres to sordid family relationships the buendia family goes through all and one hundred years of solitude is the gripping recounting of their family saga  all in all gabriel garcia marquez has moved up from the authors i always meant to read to author i finally got around to read and well it was not so bad i struggled reading this novel the theme was a mixture of magic with realism of a family in columbia over several generations and their strange lives it did not help they used the same names even with the family tree at the beginning  magical gypsies wars banana plantations sanskrit scrolls firing squads longevity boredom over eating at new levels crazy family members and lots more await you when reading this book  the book has drama comedy and tragedy all weekend woven into its fabric the ending also leaves you scratching your head my fatherinlaw loves this book so much that he gave me a copy for christmas two years in a row my father had already given me a copy years before lots of people i respect rave about this book how it is a classic a timeless work of genius a brilliant critique of capitalism etc etc i really want to share their enthusiasm i want to be a member of the tribe that has read and loved this book but i am ashamed to admit that i have never been able to finish it  i have tried to get through it several times i have charted the family trees of the characters in order to keep track of the foursyllable names and incestuous couplings  but i get bored and frustrated with the meandering plot and give up halfway through every time i keep thinking that maybe the end of the book the part ive never been able to get to is really great  there are certain things i do really like about the book which is why i still gave it three stars the writing is beautiful but i think the book as a whole is overrated  either that or im missing something the last part of the book perhaps that inspires the kind of passionate enthusiasm that people tend to have about the book and its author  ive thought a lot about it on my stroller walks lately and i have come to the following conclusion its just not my genre i prefer nonfiction and memoirs to fiction the magical realism of garca mrquez is too far out there for me  too fictional i have enjoyed reading the commentary about the book far more than i have ever enjoyed the book i have especially liked reading commentary about the books allegorical meanings readers who have linked this bizare work of fiction with fact anchored the fictional town of macondo to the places of garca mrquez childhood and the sociopolitical history of columbia  someone once told me that there are two types of people those who believe there are two types of people and those who do not i am a knitter knitters are often lumped into two groups process knitters or project knitters project knitters knit to produce wearable functional garments process knitters knit just for the experience of knitting i am a process knitter but a product reader i like to knit but im not really concerned with the finished product i like to read but my focus is what i get out of a book more than the experience of reading it i like to learn something either about a real place real person or gain some insight about myself i like my fiction to be realistic magical realism is not for me every time i read this book i ask myself where is this going what is the point where if i were a process reader perhaps id be able to let all of that go and appreciate the lyrical nature of the books beautiful writing  the cast of characters is too large i think keeping track of all of them is a major distraction from the story the plot is too abstract for me to grasp  and as much as i can appreciate the lyrical beauty of the language i have never been able to get into this book when i read this nearly  years ago i rated it  stars i think i was enchanted by what many considered as the first example of magical realism with this reread i found the book hard to finish it seemed to go on and on and i wasnt drawn in by the stories ursula remains a wonderfullydrawn character and it may be that im burned out on all things political so the political themes turned me off maybe ill rate it differently again in another  years three stars may be a little on the generous side here  i think the most appropriate and fitting review would be  one hundred fucking years of solitude as thats how long i felt it took me to wade through it this was not my first attempt to read for gabriel garca mrquez as ive read love in the time of cholera three years ago and never thought that i will read another book for him but since this book keeps popping in every single reading challenge and since seor mrquez has a special way of writing so i thought hey why not  and boy does this book make your head spin first of all this book has like a zillion and one generation so many names most of them has the same name so piece of advice google the family tree print it and keep checking if you ever get the names mixed it took me a while to get used to it and familiarize myself with the massive buenda family but its not as bad as you think  the story takes us through the establishment of macondo by the buenda family conservatives vs liberals civil war peace love hate betrayals and madness all of this happening in a span of seven generations  there are weird things spirits ghosts incest oh yes and supernatural  and lets not forget the most powerful character in the whole book  rsula iguarn the invincible woman who outlives everyone  this book is considered one of the best magic realism and whilst i think it was kind of slow everything about the book was supernatural quite literally actually and solitude  after reading two books for seor mrquez i strongly believe that he is one of the few who have a very special way with words might not think that it earns more than  stars for both of the books ive read however i enjoyed this the most of the two the story is good but just one thing bothers me strongly about this book i couldnt focus on any part of the story because my concentration have been already wasted memorizing the huge number of names and relations  this book is like a magic spell id read fifty pages at a time without looking up like i normally do unable to quite put it down when id planned to i read it carefully not skimming any of it and yet a lot of the time i wasnt that sure whether i liked it the writing is beautiful  and i wish to some extent that i could have read it in the original rather than a translation  but the cyclical nature of it with not much happening and the lack of insights into characters motivations at times wore on me im normally one for plots and characters that you can get your teeth into although i do know that sometimes you have to set that aside to really appreciate a piece of literature i liked the comparison in someone elses review to the icelandic sagas that made sense to me  i feel like ive somehow missed the point i want to join the ranks who worship the book and give it four and five stars but i cant honestly say i really liked it im not sure how much of that might be down to the translator but considering i liked the descriptions etc we might have to put it down to an inability to get over the lack of heavy plotcharacterisation  in a way i did love it just not with the kind of love i wanted to does that make any sense probably not this book kicked my butt and at  pages in i seriously considered abandoning it it is very dense writing  very little dialog with repeating names of characters and similar story lines i like the moments of magical realism but they were not frequent enough for me to make the book worthwhile i know this is supposedly one of the most remarkable literary works from south america but it just wasnt what i was in the mood for a few quotations that stood out  he did not know that it was easier to start a war than to end one pg   during the boredom of her abandonment her only distractions were the clavichord lessons at siesta time and the letters from her children in the detailed messages that she sent them every two weeks there was not a single line of truth  ive never been a fan of family sagas so i didnt quite know what to expect from this book and i have mixed feelings i liked some of the things but it also confirmed my previous belief that these are not books for me  this is a story about a whole family making the same mistakes over and over when you read this book you are constantly aware how much the fate of the next generations in this family resembles the life and problems of their ancestors it makes you reflect on the inevitability of certain events and on a persons ability to shape their own life and future you get the impression that the buenda family is locked in a cursed cycle from which only death can deliver them although even death is not free of the patterns created by their ancestors  i
A Thousand Splendid Suns,this must have been the longest time i had waited to review a fiction after finishing the book even after a week i still havent fully recuperated from the emotional blow of a thousand splendid suns painful heartbreaking but quite beautiful in a very sad way hosseini has improved upon what he did with kite runner if thats even possible in every conceivable way imaginable to give the reader another masterpiece i loved every little thing about this book  learn this now and learn it well my daughter like a compass needle that points north a mans accusing finger always finds a woman  when i finished kite runner before it became clear how impactful hosseinis story telling is it was tragic yet beautiful in a unique way i had thought i was prepared to pretty much anything the author could throw at me after that but a thousand splendid suns for me was a far more difficult read unlike in kite runner hosseini does not hold back when it comes to unfolding mariam and lailas story saying that reading through the abuse and other privations of the two protagonists was shocking would be a huge understatement everything felt too real to be consoled otherwise in the afterwards section i did come across about hosseinis work in unhcr and maybe its his firsthand experience that made the portrayal this authentic  its our lot in life mariam women like us we endure its all we have  the author continues to use his simple and straightforward writing style which suits perfectly to the atmosphere he creates in these stories but even if one finds the writing style to be lacking in flavor when the story telling is this good most would never be bothered by anything else and when you add hosseinis flawless character development its impossible not to fall in love with this book but where i saw the most significant improvement is in the plot which stole the spotlight away from character department the life story of the two protagonists mariam and laila allows the reader to peak in to a couple of lives heavily affected not only by war but their journey amidst various domestic difficulties providing the reader with another unique opportunity to empathize with afghan people and specifically from a womans point of view this time instead of coming across hateful stories about taliban and terrorism in general its enlightening to see the events from a perspective like this which enables any reader to understand the bitter reality along with the fact that countless thousands of people are experiencing worse circumstances in such countries even though it is fiction i think its commendable and remarkable what hosseini does with these stories as they help shift any readers opinion about the people who are affected by wars in such countries  people she believed now shouldnt be allowed to have new children if theyd already given away all their love to their old ones it wasnt fair  everything else that was good about kite runner is still here from pace flow of events and handling of emotions to the ending oh that ending i rarely admire a sad ending but hosseini is definitely the exception during the middle part of the book even though i loved everything i didnt see myself giving a rating higher than stars but the concluding chapters broke me down and changed everything now i feel like there arent enough starts to do justice  as she closed her eyes it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her one last time mariam did as she was told  its not every day that i get to shelf two consecutive books from the same author as alltimefavorites honestly i was not expecting this to be better than the first and thought there might even be some repetitiveness this is anything but that if you loved kite runner it is most likely that you will have an even better reading experience with this atss however be warned that the emotional impact this delivers is far more profound leaving one with tears for quite a while unlike with kite runner the luxury of hiding the despicable actions of villains which left many horrific events to readers imagination is gone but at the end of the day just like with kite runner its worth every second its worth the heartbreak its worth evert tear another mustreadforall from hosseini  a young mariam is sitting at the table making a doll by the glow of an oil lamp shes humming something her face is smooth and youthful her hair washed combed back she has all her teeth the little girl looks up puts down the doll smiles laila jo  i was riding in a cab in bombay recently and a bookseller on foot approached me at a traffic light with a stack of books i did my best not to look at the boy but i couldnt help it he was waving several books in my face and something caught my eye i thought my glance was discreet but he saw me look and it was game over the light turned green right then and the boy starts running with the cab yelling memsahib memsahib were picking up speed im so scared hes going to get his foot runover so i grab whatever i could from my wallet and somehow get it into his hands in return he tosses a random book at me through the window as hes getting further  further away from the cab i look to see what i ended up with it was a thousand splendid suns which i was planning on buying anyways the cab driver asked me how much i ended up giving the boy a hundred and fifty rupees i said which is barely  the cab driver says in return you paid a hundred rupees too much hardly i thought to myself that boy worked his butt off the best part is because the book is bootlegged its full of typos and random fonts love it in case i ever discuss the book with you and my recollection of the story is completely different from what you read youll know why  in a world where people tend to make assumptions about people and places based on the news preconceived notions prejudice etc this book needs to be read i think a good portion of the american population hears afghanistan and they think it is a country full or terrorists and unreasonable muslim extremists who all band together to plot the downfall of anyone not like them a thousand splendid suns shows the progression of life in afghanistan from the soviet takeover in s through post  taliban control all of this is through the eyes of two women trying to live a normal and peaceful life just like anyone in the world wants you will see that despite the extremists and unreasonable values of some most of the afghani people are no different than you and me  hosseini is a fantastic writer not only is the story enthralling but the way he writes is engaging and easy to follow i was never bored or confused when i was not reading the book i was thinking about the book and could not wait to get back to it and find out what happens sometimes you find the perfect book where the writing just falls into place with a click  that happened with this one while the story takes place far away and the life discussed unusual for me he made it very approachable and understandable  the characters were great the ones i was rooting for i was really rooting for the ones that i despised i really hated when i get this invested in the characters it is a sure sign of a great book  i will end with this warning while a great and interesting book it is at times difficult to read there are situations and scenarios that are upsetting and may trigger lots of emotion if you are extremely sensitive it may be difficult to make it through but if you can i think it will be worth it in the end  if you have not read this book yet i think you should give it a try the experience is very likely to be eyeopening and maybe even lifechanging i have never cried while reading a booklike i did while reading this one  it is the story of poor uneducated women who have to endure the hardships of life the horrors and terrors that a lot of women have gone through during certain period in afghanistan the war torn country and the narration through the lives of two women mariam and laila  going through all kinds of physical abuse of hitting kicking and slapping brutal beating etc struggling the cruel extremely sadistic rasheed and suffering all kinds of violence and subjected to his shifting mood and volatile temper  witnessing the ugliness of war the fate of loved ones grieving for lost lives  and sadly this is not exclusive to afghan society only it is happening in many other countries the unhappy abusive marriages oppressive governments and repressive cultural mores   it finds its echo in varying forms in differing degrees through the different time periods across the world   the end of the novel give some hope in its last scene after all the violent accidents with lailas pregnancy kabul rebuilding and a loving family reunion  i know youre still young but i want you to understand and learn this now marriage can wait education cannot and i also know that when this war is over afghanistan is going to need you as much as its men maybe even more because a society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated no chance  laila fulfilled her fathers dreams and he can rest in peace watching his brave daughter completing his path and teaching young afghan children the true values and principles of their social heritage and culture educating them how they could be good citizens in the future in this critical age when personalities are shaped and what they learn will stay with them and protecting them from falling in the hands of those who would mould them to absorb hatred violence and intolerance a thousand splendid suns is a  novel by afghanamerican author khaled hosseini  it is his second following his bestselling  debut the kite runner  mariam is an illegitimate child and suffers from both the stigma surrounding her birth along with the abuse she faces throughout her marriage  laila born a generation later is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from rasheed mariams husband  hosseini has remarked that he regards the novel as a motherdaughter story in contrast to the kite runner which he considers a fatherson story  it continues some of the themes used in his previous work such as the familial aspects but focuses primarily on female characters and their roles in afghan society khaled hosseini tells us the story of millions of daughters sisters wives and mothers through miriam and laila we can see how the taliban had shattered afghanistan in this novel the author has beautifully depicted hope tragedy and violence amid the war the way he tells the history of a country through the eyes of two women is simply brilliant this is a mustread book for everyone and can be considered one of the few books that can change the lives of people in the best possible way one could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls a thousand splendid suns was a brilliant but heartbreaking story the writing was stunning and the plot treat was inspired by true events was fantastic the characterisation although fictional was believable and authentic however it was the inspiration and knowledge that the mistreatment of women is commonplace is what made this such a tearful read  women in many societies accept and even embrace the only environment they know some are even happy in it and it is not for us to judge any society to say what is right except this if women do want a voice the freedom to work and be educated then society should consider to not do so is suppressive suffocating and sometimes brutal and so applause for khaled hosseini who has given them a voice through his story and an in insight into a life that is all too real for many women  a letter of regret that miraim never got to read speaks of her fathers regret may god grant you a long and prosperous life my daughter may god give you many healthy and beautiful children may you find the happiness peace and acceptance that i did not give you be well i leave you in the loving hands of god your undeserving father jalil  a sensational and stunning book with epic qualities a powerful and heartbreaking story and a reflection from the author  to see women we must look at the humanity beneath the veils and for me also in the hearts of those women who are dispossessed of their greatest needs unfortunatlythere is only five starsi wish i could give it moresimply outstanding but this book deserves a thousand splendid stars it is a true masterpiece and a wonderful book  learn this now and learn it well my daughter like a compass needle that points north a mans accusing finger always finds a woman always you remember that mariam  this story chronicles  years of afghan history from soviet invasion to the taliban to posttaliban this story is told from the perspective of two women born a generation apart with different ideas of love and family two very different childhoods they are bought together by loss and by war this story shows both the dangers that mariam and laila face on the streets of kabul and in the home this story shows the important bond of friendship and how strong this is especially when faced with difficult decisions or scenarios and how this bond of love will effect the next generation  where i come from one wrong look and blood is spilled where i come from a womans face is her husbands business only i want you to remember that  my heart bled for mariams childhood she held little freedom and was sheltered from most of the outside world she knew very few people as well and had a mother who refused help for a mental illness labeling it as the jinn taking over her body mariam had little luxuries and was denied an education by those around her these exact things that most of us take forgranted  on the other hand laila had siblings and a father that absolutely adored her she also had friends her own age with whom she truly cherished and had the privilege of an education  however both womens lives are brought together through tumultuous events leading them to both have the same fate and live in a very unhappy household where abuse and violence takes place at the hands of their controlling husband rasheed  laila never would have believed that a human body could withstand this much beating this viciously this regularly and keep functioning  the level of control and subordination of these women shocked me reading parts of this book left a stale taste in my mouth over the abuse and learned helplessness these women face  singing is forbidden dancing is forbidden attention women you will stay inside your homes at all times if you go outside you must be accompanied by a male relative you will not under any circumstance show your face girls are forbidden from attending school all schools for girls will be closed immediately  hosseini does a fantastic job at describing the rules that both men and women face under taliban rule and sharia law its almost hard to believe the inequality and the restriction of freedom the women in this story faced it made me feel like my stomach had plummeted to my feet it also made me incredibly angry my fists curling on more than one occasion  on the whole this book is extremely thoughtprovoking and not easy to digest however it also inflames the human body with emotion heartbreaking heartclenching and the story hits you like punches to the gut this book will resonate with some people who have lived through wartorn countries or under the terrifying taliban rule or as in my case it will be a learning experience for example learning afghan history and the shifts in the treatment of women culturally it also makes the reader consider their own privilege compared to the stories of both laila and mariam  i think the most stunning thing about this novel is that whilst mariam and laila are fictional characters it applies to so many women out there for example around  million girls globally are not in school hosseini may be writing fictional characters but these are the stories of an army of resilient and brave women who have lived and breathed this life he makes the reader aware  this book provided devastation and loss as well as hope and love and beauty hosseini approaches the plot in a very realistic way and it is written beautifully this is an unforgettable read for me and the stories of laila and mariam will stay with me for a while  one could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls i didnt know whether to keep on reading or dnf this book i didnt know if i should give it  stars or  the thing is i cannot abide extreme hardship pain and suffering on behalf of the characters that are in the books i read  im certain that this is to be the last book id read this year and what a book did it prove to be the mind reels at the barbarism that can be eked from such perverted ways of thinking reason rationality are out of the window  i know i havent mentioned the plot or who appears in the book but i cannot i cannot summarize this book i need to read one of my favorite non fiction writers posthaste i must forget the rawness of a thousand splendid suns the latter reads like a horrible documentary i must dull the sadness in me sorry people its the best that i can do i started this book with high expectations i had been overwhelmed with every conceivable emotion when i read the kite runner and just couldnt believe that his second book a thousand splendid suns could possibly be as good  so it was with trepidation and yet excitement that i read this book i had left the last dozen or so pages to read until the following morning as i didnt want to quite let it go and as i sat there at  am on the terrace with a cup of coffee in my hand i slowly finished the book i breathed in deeply on reading the final sentence and looked down the valley past the foothills at the pic danie part of the magnificent pyrenean mountain chain the sun would be rising over the hills within the hour as i looked in the direction of afghanistan wondering how many moslems had already prayed that morning in the mosques with their prayer mats facing towards makkah in saudi arabia  this book was an extraordinary contemporary social document covering afghan history from before the soviet war until after the taliban rule the violence that ensued from this period in time resulted in the inevitable violence towards women i abhor any form of violence and live in fear what will happen should another war occur to see in what lowesteem and contempt the average afghan viewed women especially the taliban quite shocked me and yet i lived and breathed this book women were worth nothing  i think the reason this book had such a profound effect on me was due to living in saudi arabia for sixteen years and i could relate to a certain extent to what the women had to endure under the quran men were entitled to have up to four wives and they were supposed to treat them all equally then a man could just arbitrarily state i divorce thee three times and that was the end of the marriage many women were just cast out from the family home and led a miserable existence begging on the streets what was remarkable about these women however was their instinct for survival and they still managed to laugh and joke  the authors own words were concise and to the point of life in afghanistan at that time  for almost three decades now the afghan refugee crisis has been one of the most severe around the globe war hunger anarchy and oppression forced millions of peopleto abandon their homes and flee afghanistan to settle in neighboring pakistan and iran  the book is basically the powerful story of two women mariam and laila whose lives become indelibly linked because of three men jalil tariq and rasheed  mariam was the illegitimate daughter of jalil living with her mother nana in an isolated place outside of herat she really loves her father and decides that she wishes to live with him instead of her mother with disastrous consequences the upshot being that mariam is forced to become the wife of rasheed in kabul  laila is a good childhood friend of tariq and they finally fall in love with far reaching results when tariq leaves with his family for pakistan laila whos a great survivor and philosophical as is mariam then becomes rasheeds wife  for the two women life with rasheed becomes a living hell i kept on thinking i just want something really evil to happen to this despicable creature i have worse thoughts than that but best to keep quiet on that and not write them down  in reality tariq the childhood friend of laila is the catalyst in the book i really admired him he was my favorite character and he was brilliantly portrayed  the writing style is simple as far as im concerned and there is an over excess of violence however the attention for detail is remarkable and this runs throughout the book  when laila is recovering at rasheeds home after a bomb attack mariam sees a complete and utter change in her husband he becomes unusually kind and gentle and he is seen to be courting laila  the humiliation of both mariam and laila at having to wear the burqa thus putting them into insignificance to the outside world the husband being the only person allowed to look upon their faces  the incident when rasheed makes love to laila for the first time she to all intents and purposes is a virgin she has a knife cuts her finger and leaves some blood on the bed under where they were sleeping  laila cooking a rather bad meal for rasheed and the end results with the stones  laila mariam and rasheed with the shovel this nearly blew my mind  mariam in jail refusing to see anyone and then her journey to the football stadium i had the most incredible feeling of time just stopping at this point and had great difficulty in turning the page but then this happened to me on innumerable occasions throughout this wonderful book  im always intrigued with the titles of books and this one was no exception this originated from a poem written by saibetabrizi in the th century and is quoted by lailas father babi when the family had decided to leave kabul he could however only remember these two lines  one could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls  i just absolutely loved this book however im not happy having purely the kindle version and so ive ordered the hardback i still get more pleasure from a book  and i have khaled hosseinis third book to look forward to in a few months and the mountains echoed can this be even better is that possible yes this book doesnt have the full  impact of wow that was amazing but it was pretty damn good this is my favorite type of story that slowly weaves its threads and develops a narrative over generations and just when you think all of the ends are tied up it comes full circle and punches you in the gut all over again this book is just as empowering as it is tragic and hosseini is just masterful at storytelling at this magnificent scope the writing is gorgeous without being longwinded the characters are so exquisitely fleshed out its also one of those rare books thats pretty melancholy throughout the duration of the book but something about getting to the ending just really brought out the floodworks and im sitting here typing this review lookin like that one mindy kaling meme  hosseinis books have all proven tremendous and if youre intimidated but still want to try them out i would recommend this on audio this is one of the most bittersweet infuriating yet touching books ive ever read wowww maybe it does deserve the full five stars at  while i was still playing jack stones or watching japanese anime the girls in the story perpetually worried that any day they would be given away to some stranger in marriage while i complained about the heat during bedtime these girls feared they would wake up tomorrow without a home and a family or worse would not wake up altogether what hurt me most is the thought that although the characters and settings may be fictional the events in the entire story did take place in afghanistan and may still be taking place in other places around the world call me selfish but the story made me appreciate my life even more  it is a heartwrenching yet inspiring story that haunted me for days but from the very bottom of my heart i thank the mr khaled hosseini for his unrivaled bravery and generosity for writing a thousand splendid suns a story about a womans strength resilience and will to have a place in a society of endless wars and conflicts and where laws and social rules seem to conspire against her this is a story that shows how a woman can be beaten spit on or even stoned to death and yet her spirit and faith wont waver she will continue to fight for the ones she loves without complaint and will continue to weep and bleed for the love of her country  i love how the lens of the story starts by zooming in on a small village on one small character whose role in society seems of least significance and then zooms out onto the bigger picture showing the conflicts in the country as a whole and how in the end the small character will mark a huge place in the society even though this was one of my saddest heaviest reads this year i still look forward to reading the rest of the books written by the author   on a much lighter note happy birthday to one of my most awesome most wonderful friends masooma friends like you rarely come to a persons life and im really lucky to have met you i wish you everything that will make you happy and i dont need to specify books lol love yah girl i recently finished the kite runner and i though i should also add a review to a thousand splendid suns the first book i read by khaled hosseini  womens rights is a subject of great interest for me and i am touched by any story where they are suppressed afghanistan is one of the worst countries to be born a woman the story of the two mc made me angry sad and hopeless even if the book offers a a happy ending in real life the hope for afghan women is still dim beutifully written poignant and moving a novel that deserves to be read and reread  i first read a thousand splendid suns in  and was so moved by the story of marian and laila that i planned on rereading it within a year but the best laid plans and all that finally came up in an online book group read and just couldnt wait to read it again to see would i react the say way as i did seven years ago  a thousand splendid suns is an incredible chronicle of thirty years of afghan history and a deeply moving story of family friendship faith and the salvation to be found in love  an amazing sense of time and place along with memorable likeable and dislikable characters and a plot that is educational and emotionally draining makes this novel the incredible read that it is and the reason for my  star rating in  and again in  while i remembered most of the characters and the story line it was still a great read second time around and knowing that the discussion with the group would be lively and challenging added an extra bonus to reading this for a second time a compelling and heartbreaking story that stays with you long after you finish the novel and this is one book that makes me thankful for the life i was born into  a wonderful read and a book that everyone should read at least once it is not the book that you hold in your hands but its the other way round the way this book grips you is beyond imagination though i have lot of fascination for the books set in middleeast afghanistan specifically and african continent but still that this is the kind of book that maintains that fascination in me  mariam was five years old the first time she heard the word harami this was quite a very unexpected starting from any writer but the way this leads further depict the depth of thought writers carrying all the way from first sentence of the novel till last innocence of a child is described with sensibility the fad a childs having about new things and how one in that little age waits for hisher fatherparents to brought them to the new places and let them have acquaintance with new people and more familiar with unknown places written nicely and amazing to read as well i liked to quote the scene when a vase with painted chrysanthemums slipped from mariams hands and how she thought what would happened to her mother considering this crimenous situation she created unknowingly when nana saw the bowl her face flushed red and her upper lip shivered and her eyes both the lazy one and the good settled on mariam in a flat unblinking way nana looked so mad that mariam feared the jinn would enter her mothers body again but the jinn didnt come not that time instead nana grabbed mariam by the wrists pulled her close and through gritted teeth said you are a clumsy little harami this is my reward for everything ive endured an heirloombreaking clumsy little harami  at every point this novel proves the way one work should be to bind the readers from each end there was not a single loose end where one could feel like cheated  this book is mostly about mariam and laila but every single character was defined properly and given complete individual space of their own which is rare to find from most of the topend writers of fiction be it contemporary or historical or both author amazed at every single point when you seems to story going usual  the condition of afghanistan that has been explained visualize the pain behind it very closely not just the human at most but even the nonislamic structures like bamiyan buddha was destroyed without any single thought ion it as countrys  one of historys biggest heritage quoting if president bush doesnt help us he had said these terrorists will damage the us and europe very soon a month before that laila had learned that the taliban had planted tnt in the crevices of the giant buddhas in bamiyan and blown them apart calling them objects of idolatry and sin there was an outcry around the world from the us to china governments historians and archaeologists from all over the globe had written letters pleaded with the taliban not to demolish the two greatest historical artifacts in afghanistan but the taliban had gone ahead and detonated their explosives inside the twothousandyearold stone carved bamiyan buddhas on the mountain side they had chanted allahuakbar with each blast cheered each time the statues lost an arm or a leg in a crumbling cloud of dust laila remembered standing atop the bigger of the two buddhas with babi and tariq back in  a breeze blowing in their sunlit faces watching a hawk gliding in circles over the sprawling valley below but when she heard the news of the statues demise laila was numb to it it hardly seemed to matter how could she care about statues when her own life was crumbling dust thoughts of characters itself defined the beauty and importance of culture once been the part of afghanistan they got out of the taxi babi pointed there they are look tariq gasped laila did too and she knew then that she could live to be a hundred and she would never again see a thing as magnificent  be it kabul or herat khaled had given the clear picture of the time these cities actually were in not to mention but this book has the ability to mask any fiction of its time without any question its not just mariam laila tariq rasheed or aziza and zalmai its frame of time and space beyond imagination that is carrying with it pain love guilt regret endurance and empathy midconversation quotations from legends were also too good like tell your secret to the wind but dont blame it for telling the trees  khalil gibran   there was a very closely connected relations between different characters which depicted the real sense of life within the people of afghanistan even when they endured so much hard times read in an article by elizabeth weiss mcgolerick about the relationship between father  daughter and found the words so connecting a positive fatherdaughter relationship can have a huge impact on a young girls life and even determine whether or not she develops into a strong confident woman a fathers influence in his daughters life shapes her selfesteem selfimage confidence and opinions of men the relation between laila and her babi is same as aforementioned lines like tweenagers more like friends than the obvious social term of fatherdaughter relation that developed between laila and mariam also out of empathy is beyond any blood connection how two women in their different ages of life got connected because of the pain they borne and shame that they had seenfa
The Grapes of Wrath,this was a library book i didnt get on with it at all despite trying to read it twice i gave up about a third of the way through in the end  it is about the life of one american family during the great depression there is some beautiful creative writing in places but the story itself is so very slow it just didnt hold my interest due to the lengthy dialogue between the characters who were talking about nothing in particular it was like being a fly on the wall at a really dull tea party where everyone is making small talk it seems they were allowing waves of nostalgia to sweep over themforcing everyone to listen as one by one they recounted monotonous tales from their youth  i guess i probably shouldnt make such comments about something labelled a classic but for me it was not as a christian i also found the language particularly the regular blasphemy offensive and would probably have stopped reading earlier for that reason had it not been a classic i also didnt appreciate the early scenes where the local vicar was using his position to bed all of the young women in his parish  i dont recommend this book due to the language the sexual content and the monotony im sorry i wasted a few hours on it i consider that i have carried out my duty by advising you fellow readers not to do the same this is a great book very well written and important  i hated it i am perhaps digging my own grave by giving a negative review to the wellrespected steinbeck but grapes of wrath is a sore disappointment steinbecks epic is a thinly disguised forum for political social and religious dialogue unlike great literature which can address any number of complexities or issues in the context of a larger narrative steinbeck presents a only a set of ideas and bends flat characters and a thin plot around these views his characters are intended only for metaphorical interpretation and offer little substance  steinbecks interchapters which portray misery through broad sweeping claims without engaging any of the main characters or advancing the plot are the books most interesting portions despite the emotional manipulation that they set forth to add insult to injury the novel itself is barely literary it feels as though steinbeck is following a checklist of what to include in a novel foreshadowing check symbolism check conflict you betcha this would be bad enough by itself but it isnt even done subtly steinbeck might as well have put up neon signs pointing out the literary devices used he seems to cram as much into the novel as he can only for the sake of including rather than for any intrinsic merit finally the messages themselves are somewhat strange the tone of much of the novel can be described as guiltmongering  steinbecks characters are in a particularly bleak situation victimized by the depression the dust bowl and capitalist land owners  and the readers are made to feel guilty for something that others have done at the risk of repeating myself this guilt comes from the narrators direct condemnations not through the readers own understanding of the text or connection with the characters  moreover the book has many religious themes  from the prose style which imitates the text of the old testament to the very title which alludes to revelation  yet the religious messages are quite sacrilegious the main protagonists epiphany comes from rejecting traditional doctrines even the idea that all humans have a soul in exchange for looser pseudochristian ideals the characters in the text who support traditional ideals are either evil hypocrites or in the case of the heroes specifically granma laughable foolish and senile because of their naive ignorance this book does not present ideas in an intellectual fashion it is not worthy to be counted among the greats i am not criticizing the inclusion of a set of ideas or even of the marxist communist or religious undertones i am criticizing steinbecks absolute failure write a story with a moral he opts instead for a moral disguised as a story this would have been great if it had been shorter and only contained certain chapters there were some wonderfully written omniscient thirdperson chapters that were magical and descriptive informative insightful wonderful these told me more of the story and america at that time than the other chapters did they were poignant and i thoroughly enjoyed them the rest of the chapters the rest of the whole book were abysmal  the characters and the plot were pretty much pointless it was an interesting premise really and i did enjoy the opening parts with joad hitching a ride and his mannerisms but they disappeared pretty quickly and all of a sudden we had anonymous and trivial and thats all i have to say on this particular book  a load of joad are trucking down the road to californy from oklahomy set during the great depression and tackling many important issues like religion and politics taught in universities and considered one of the great american novels of the th century  i was expecting this to be depressing being set in the great depression but what i did not expect was it to make me mad i cant express enough my disappointment i really struggled with the pace leisurely is a kind way to say it its so slow and repetitive steinbeck does a good job telling the story of the joad family as well as a history of depression era america but that leads to repetitive story telling since the joad family live steinbecks version of american history which leads me to my main problem the viewpoints in the book are very heavy handed most notably the anti christian and left wing politics seems to me if you believe the way steinbeck does you will enjoy this more than i did theres a reason i guess hes californias favorite author and beloved by liberal universities ill leave it at that the joad family is a average family with problems like everyone else an i respect steinbecks fictitious family but i dont like them the moms blatant favoritism really annoyed me treating to hit her pregnant daughter for moping after her man left her than turning around and telling her murdering son its not his fault and protecting him till the end is just one example of the family truism on display i also was very disappointed by the end it was abrupt and kinda weird i was willing to give this  or maybe even  stars giving a prophetic ending but the ending sealed a  star out of disappointment for the lost opportunity kept waiting for a uplifting ending i know the final scene is suppose to symbolize something good out of a heartbreaking tragedy and i get the symbolism but maybe i need a professor to explain the beauty of it cause i just though it was weird and why use such simple language if you need a professor to explain it steinbeck has a talent of taking simple vocabulary and using it to create a descriptive world and complex feelings i think he is a great author but he strikes me as a core values author if you think the same way he does hes a prophet hes probably able even to convivence you to his way of thinking which is sort of his job especially in  america for a author  so thats the thoughts of one philistine book butcher leave your hate mail in the response section in conclusion great american epic but not for me my memory of it from reading it in high school like wading through heavy sticky mud for no real purpose or payoff i finished it out of sheer pride the story doesnt redeem it i got nothing out of this supposed masterpiece apparently i have terrible taste or did in high school probably should reread a more honest title would have been the grapes of distortion  words cannot express my hatred for this book if goodreads allowed it this book would get a  star rating if i could find every copy of this book id bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor gather the residue and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy if i had a functional time machine id seriously consider making sure this book never was created  somehow john steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author voice that drips with unparalleled condescention i consider the grapes of wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsuspecting students by braindead literati who call it literaturemost likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats  my grandparents were very much like okies from the depression era they came from the missouri ozarks got married in  and raised  children during this era my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm mostly shoveling pig manure obviously my grandparents were very culturally similar to the okies steinbeck attempted to portray in this novel i find the grapes of wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy  the reason why is that the grapes of wrath uses symbols and referrents that were completely alien to their world view in no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like steinbeck does of course steinbeck doesnt care hes too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens instead he transmogrifies their world view into something palatable to selfidentified intelligentsia based in university english departments of course their experience expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldnt be sophisticated enough to make their experience valid oh no instead he needed to create something totally alien to them and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience  to understand how offensive the grapes of wrath is its as if someone tried to write a novelization of boyz n the hood using symbols and cultural referents typical among members of augusta national golf club using ghetto slang rendered into dialect by a white man with an elite education and then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of american ghetto experience the grapes of wrath is a  word definition of noblesse oblige  in short steinbeck is saying we cant care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand while validating their selfproclaimed intellectual superiority  no passage demonstrates steinbecks pseudointellectual posing more than the scene of the turtle crossing the highway steinbeck tries to import evolutionary concepts into his work but he so thoroughly botches the attempt he shows his utter ignorance of evolutionary theory rather than the erudition he wishes to display this passage clearly depends on something known as group selection theory a theory that is at best a very weak force in evolution group selection was blown out of the water by altruistic gene theory to be fair to steinbeck altruistic gene theory didnt appear in biological journals until the s well after wraths  pub dateeven so anyone with a sound grasp of darwins origin of the species can see that darwin himself understood the basics of altruistic gene theory thus a truly knowledgable individual would have known group selection was an unsound basis for literary symbolism  i do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme probably driven by being forced to read it  times during my education and write papers on it reading it was bad enough having to write three papers on the grapes of wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to put pen to paper for the rest of their life i so hated this book that i found myself wanting the california farmers to grind the okies into dust so that the horrible thing would end and i could stop reading it or perhaps that the entire joad family would get mowed down by a zephyr hurtling down the highway so theyd be put out of their misery unfortunately deathrace  wouldnt get made for another  years  i wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book and i recognize that there are many can understand why legions of students i would suggest they are a silent majority hate it as i did many years ago im trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like youre not mature enough or youre just not capable of understanding i thoroughly understand steinbecks craft and i despise it  i must admit however that part of my implacable hatred is a matter a taste rather than objective reason i would like to thinkwere i to find myself in the position of the okiesid find a way to beat the game the grapes of wrath offers no character with any hope of such an outcome instead it portrays the no win scenario to paraphrase the popculture star trek movie the wrath of khan  which sadly is reality for far too many people in this world while knowing this situation to be part of human experience i dont want it in my fiction and i certainly dont want  words of it  what makes the grapes of wrath even worse is steinbecks undeniable literary gifts the grapes of wrath is the artistic equivalent of pablo picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying josef stalins treatment of the ukraine i did not enjoy this book okay there were some really interesting parts like a random scene with an upside down turtle illustrating how futile life is or something and the description is nice that being said sometimes theres too much of it i dont need a full paragraph of grandpa scratching under his testicles thanks the whole book can be summarized as such we hate this farm lets go on a long journey to california to make money working in a vineyard long journey sucks california sucks grapes of wrath more like grapes of trash i do not like this book i suppose ill be shot down in flames but its boring and contrived dreadful in almost every respect the grapes of wrath is a dreadful dull book how the same man who penned east of eden and of mice and men could also pen something as uninspired as tedious as the grapes of wrath will forever elude me i suppose john steinbeck was a mere mortal and not everything he wrote could be a masterpiece but  man  i think whats more puzzling is the grapes of wrath seems for some baffling reason to be steinbecks most acclaimed novel how in the world do any of the characters any of the situations in this book come close to the moment in east of eden where lee sam hamilton and adam have the timshel revelation or when in of mice and men george mercy kills his oafish friend lenny to save him from imminent torture and pain  this is a joke that people could even put grapes of wrath anywhere in the same breadth as those two marvellous pieces of literature i honestly feel offended every second chapter in this book was about nameless people or the common mans sufferings this was a truly dreadful decision steinbeck made i simply didnt care about the nameless tenants and wives that steinbeck wrote about in these chapters let alone the joads or any of the supposed main characters in the story  i dont understand it the book is so tediously written steinbeck just goes on and on about the landscape and the nameless tenants and the chapters are just so stretched out and are all so empty of anything substantial ill give you a quick example of this early on in the grapes of wrath  the owners of the land came onto the land or more often a spokesman for the owners came they came in closed cars and they felt the dry earth with their fingers and sometimes they drove big earth augers into the ground for soil tests the tenants from their sunbeaten dooryards watched uneasily when the closed cars drove along the fields and at last the owner men drove into the dooryards and sat in their cars to talk out of the windows the tenant men stood beside the cars for a while and then squatted on their hams and found sticks with which to mark the dust  in the open doors the women stood looking out and behind them the children  cornheaded children with wide eyes one bare foot on top of the other bare foot and the toes working the women and children watched their men talking to the owner men they were silent  some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do and some were angry because they hated to be cruel and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one where cold and all of them were caught in something larger than themselves some of them hated the mathematics that drove them and some were afraid and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling if a bank or finance company owned the land the owner man said the bank  or the companyneedswantsinsistsmust have as though the bank or the company were a monster with thought and feeling which had ensnared them these last would take no responsibility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time  okay i think thats enough transcribing utterly drab isnt it i mean thats  words what did those  words really tell us that banks are like machines and are evil i suppose that its hard to be a land owner okie dokie steinbeck great observation but the problem is youre not writing a political piece for the times youre doing a novel a novel usually though not always has characters the reader cares about some kind of tension or struggle which the main characters will usually either surmount or break under and a payoff a resolution the book is just so intent on making useless observations and describing until it cant describe no more that it loses sight of whats really important in a story it loses sight of it completely  the grapes of wrath is just not a very good book i hate to say thats not to say steinbeck is a bad writer because he certainly isnt if you havent read east of eden or of mice and men correct that now its just that this particular novel does not work and i do not like it  i believe steinbeck himself said that writers usually have one book in them and everything else is just a variation of that that very well could be true if not a little bit of a generalization all i know is grapes of wrath is not that book what is so great about this american novel  john steinbeck was a committed leftist and communist who only ever at most passed through oklahoma and decided that he was going to tell us all how evil capitalism is by making up a whole bunch of junk and passing it off as the plight of the average southern plains farmer except hardly anything in the novel actually portrays any of the real events  first off the dust bowl was centered around the panhandle area of oklahoma with boise city being the epicenter so to speak but portions of colorado kansas texas and new mexico were also part of the dust bowl the joad family is portrayed as being from eastern oklahoma yes that portion of the state was affected as nearly the entire country was but not nearly to the extent that the grapes of wrath says  second for every one family that left oklahoma for the greener pastures of california three stayed and the vast majority that did leave were not farmers but people in cities or more populated areas who were skilled laborers and had a decent education  third the majority of the migrant farmers werent even okies but came from all over the country in search of better opportunity if john steinbeck had spent even a tenth of as much time as he claimed with the migrant farmers he would have come to this realization  fourth many banks held out as long as they could in extending deadlines on mortgages and other loans one family stated the bank should have foreclosed on them three years before they actually did other businesses also extended as much credit as they could in order to try to alleviate the burdens the farmers of the dust bowl region were facing so for all the evils of capitalism some humanity was demonstrated  truth however probably didnt matter to steinbeck as he was more committed to undermining what real okies were like what the real struggles were and if he could tell some lies to promote communism all the better for him  frankly this is a highly inaccurate and extremely distorted view of the true nature of the great depression and the dust bowl in my opinion it isnt worth reading i cant help it i hate this book with the fiery passion of a thousand hells the grapes of wrath is a landmark of american literature a portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless of one mans fierce reaction to injustice and of one womans stoical strength the novel captures the horrors of the great depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in america although it follows the movement of thousands of men and women and the transformation of an entire nation the grapes of wrath is also the story of one oklahoma family the joads who are driven off their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of california out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an america divided into haves and havenots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision elemental yet plainspoken tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity  yeah so i really didnt much care for this classic it was intensely depressing which i suppose is the point and didnt even resolve in the end ive said before that while i realize that real life doesnt always have neat little story arcs that tie off nicely in appropriate places i still feel that novels should is it too plebeian to want a story to have as they say a beginning a middle and an end i dont necessarily need a happy ending but i need some kind of something books that just sort of say ok well i think im just going to stop now annoy me the structure of such books frequently bugs me too because there is often no real drama nothing really happens things happen but there generally isnt anything in particular that the story is driving towards there arent really any peaks or climactic moments its all just one long flat storyline as a result i find it difficult to really be interested in it  making that even more difficult is that steinbeck interrupts the joad story every chapter or so with a general chapter about nameless faceless people all going through the same thing honestly i understand that the joads are kind of the emblem of the whole countrys struggle i understand that steinbeck used them to represent everybody in that situation i get it i really do i dont need to have that anvil dropped on my head every other chapter it gets me out of the story and makes me even less interested in the proceedings if hed just told the story of the joad family beginning to end minus the distractions of the general chapters maybe he could have found an arc for them and given them some kind of ending by the time he finished  maybe it also would have helped if half the characters hadnt been intensely annoying tom was ok and ma and pa were ok but al with his constant obsession with getting laid annoying rose of sharon and btw rose of fucking sharon what the fuck is up with that name with her constant whining ok so shes pregnant and her husband is a jackass who ran off still whining doesnt help anybody and its annoying and the younger kids ruthie and winfield oh my god where do i even start with them especially ruthie i dont know exactly how old they were but id guess somewhere in the preteen years or maybe a little younger there again i get that their entire life has been uprooted theyre hungry bored and often just generally miserable but honestly how long do you have to go before you start realizing that there simply is no money to buy you candy and whining incessantly helps no one acting like a giant brat all the time is even worse this is no time to be a pretty pretty princess yes that sucks and i realize that im very fortunate to never have been in their position but you gotta suck it up eventually mom and dad are doing everything they bloody well can to keep you fed maybe try appreciating that just a little and try and help out in whatever ways you can rather than whining about how tired you are and how much you want cracker jacks i wanted to reach into the book and smack ruthie almost every time she opened her mouth what an obnoxious little wretch seriously  oh and everybody mentions this but seriously the turtle a whole chapter albeit a short one about a turtle who doesnt even figure into the story much ultimately maybe hes some kind of metaphor i was sort of hoping that the joad story would eventually sort of parallel his where hes going about his business someones nice to him someone hurts him he picks himself up and keeps going then gets taken in by someone open to interpretation whether that was a good thing or not then escapes and continues on his way doesnt really sync up with the joads story except extremely loosely since they were both on the move i just figure if youre going to bring in a random turtle there really ought to be some purpose to it but thats just me if someday i am abducted by some breed of sadistic aliens and they strap me down to a chair i will look them dead in the eye or whatever they see out of and spit do your worst i will do my best to endure whatever torture they can think up however if these aliens are crafty enough to read the grapes of wrath out loud to me then i will gladly give away any information on our planet that could be of use why couldnt steinbeck imply that the characters where somewhat retarded instead of making us read dialog only a redneck could understand mah wha for daner behgan strips an mash diddly didly dooo dale earnhart dam doodle this was terrible i mean absolutely  terrible i hated it i dont understand why anyone would write this to be completely honest i was very glad when all  unnecessary pages of it was over first all of the characters were irrational and harsh rose of sharon was annoying and hormonal tom was practically addicted to violence ma was always chewing someone out uncle john always wanted to get drunk al just wanted sex or a truck to work on the only person i actually liked was connie and he left i didnt actually care about any of the characters which is kind of important the southern drawl was a little hard to decipher as well second all of the descriptions were either misplaced too long for the reader to care about them or pointless i skimmed through pretty much all of the descriptions from the halfwaypoint on otherwise it would have taken just too long to read most of them were misplaced so it seemed like the author put them in there just to make it longer or forced them in lastly there was no plot seriously think about it the joads are moving west because their farm was taken from them thats it nothing exciting happens and there is pretty much no conflict they just keep moving from town to town to find jobs and get food the only thing remotely conflicting was when rose of sharon was going to have her baby except for the fact that she was so annoying that the reader stopped caring at least i did anyway at the ending there was nothing to resolve because no conflict had been established plus the end was so disturbing that i completely lost any interest in finishing which was pretty much none to begin with do i realize the significance of the book yes of course i do im not blind nor do i live in a box this was a giant metaphor for the american dream and the measures people took back then to survive however it was nothing more for me than that im sorry if you loved this book or if it was your favorite but i hated it so im reading an entire chapter about a turtle on a dirt road a truck comes by and flips the turtle over  yeah maybe its a metaphor for the joads struggle maybe it symbolizes puny mans helplessness in the cosmos  but most likely its just another pointless artistic frolic at the expense of the narrative well after few weeks of reading this book i decided to give up it is not addictive and when i was thinking about opening this book the only thing i felt was disappointment and reluctance so i decided to take the only appropriate step and leave this story without finishing it time to move forward and find something that will really move me i think we were always taught that unless we read classics  whatever that means  the reading we are doing is somehow subpar but guess what i am heavily over reading old white men whose writing is hard to read slow and you need to constantly search for  a good female character and  the meaning of anything and everything i do respect steinbecks drip but it is not for me ok i spent  hours watching the movie and hours listening to this on cd i want all that time back please this book was depressing and dry now im a person with deep feelings and i cry easily especially when it deals with animals i did not feel a damn thing for any of the deaths not the dog not the grandfather or the grandmother not for the dying mrs wilson not for the baby still born or any one leaving i just wanted the book over let us not forget those chapters that had nothing to do with the story but were either metaphors or just hey heres what else was going on during the same time they were the worst parts now i know people are gonna say but its a classic how can you not like it easy i didnt like it i have an opinion and its different from yours and youll just have to accept that ok thats all i have to say a few years ago i decided to set a goal for myself of one day reading all the pulitzer prize novels had i not set that goal for myself i would not have finished this book although there were some moments of beautiful prose the overall story was so incredibly boring that i dreaded reading the book the joad family was just not compelling the only character i remotely sympathized with was rose of sharon who got thoroughly screwed by her circumstances from start to finish especially the last few moments of the bookliterally the most bizarre conclusion i have ever read im sure that when this book was first released it was poignant and relatable but it does not hold up for later generations a man once told me that the ending was so sweet and delicate that it brought him to tears once i reached the ending i realized that i didnt want to talk to that man anymore and i havent since sometimes when im in class and my teacher mentions the book i have flashbacks its like ptsd but for a book i hate this book so much had to read for school and it was a nightmare to get through steinbeck doesnt know how to write for any minority groups and uses a ton of slurs when doing so he brushes off the plights of certain groups that have historically been abused such as prison populations poc and native americans on reservations also he does that annoying straight male author thing of over describing ladies boobs and butts and writes them more of sexual objects than people with the slight exception of ma and rosasharn and not to kinkshame but hes definitely got some weird fetishes that he shoved in there foot fetish definitely among them take a shot every time he says something among the lines of pretty feet and dont even get me started on that mess of an ending i dont go to school just to be forced to read an in detail description of a woman breastfeeding a grown adult old man that is just nasty that is so nasty and it really made me wish i was jared   the characters really feel flat and dont feel developed or flawed enough to be considered realistic except for like granma tom joad is a total mary sue and i could write a whole essay on that but tbh its too late at night for me to do that  also back to how much i hate steinbecks writing style there are so many unnecessary intercalorie im probably spelling that wrong but please cut me some slack its  am chapters that are just overloaded with metaphors and repetitive descriptions i get that the turtle chapter is a metaphor and its an important social commentary or whatever but its boring and i really dont feel like sitting there and analyzing every time the turtle blinks look if i wanted social commentary overloaded with so many metaphors that its impossible to interpret them all i would have just rewatched falsettos at least thats entertaining and has a cohesive nonrepetitive plot that actually elicits any form of sympathy for the characters  oh thats another thing i should talk about the plot after the exposition each plot based chapter once again theres still a ton of unnecessary intercalorie chapters that mostly focus on the big picture of the great depression even though the same exact topics are covered in the main chapters the formula is as follows the joads ride in the truck obligatory rosasharn is very pregnant paragraph they get to a camp cam
"Anne of Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables, #1)",im seeing a trend with steinbeck and me and we just dont seem to get along god almighty how tedious and what is with that ending is it supposed to be endearing and show how humans stick together i found it disturbing the way steinbeck characterizes womenits disgraceful honestly and i could say the same for the mother in east of eden i guess steinbeck just hates women yeah yeah those were the times where women listened to their husbands were seen and not heard cooked and cleaned and minded the children ive read victorian novels written by men that treat women with more dignity respect and agency than steinbecks piss poor characterizations never reading another steinbeck again  of  stars to anne of green gables the first book in a series by lm montgomery written in  i read this book nearly  years ago and had to refresh my memory a little before writing the review id forgotten it was part of a whole series i read more than one but not sure which other ones i recall this first one a tale about an orphan girl acclimating to a new family meeting friends and neighbors on the outskirts its a comingofage tale about a young girl becoming a woman and learning about the realities of life its both a funny book to read and an educational one with some lessons its something every kid should read just to understand how good they have it or if they are adopted to learn how to deal with it annes a beautiful person forgetting age for a few seconds and whenever shes around it sorta feels like the comforts of home if you havent sampled it read one of the books in the series just to see what life was like for a girl like her over a century ago itll be a positive read even so many years later  an orphan girl is taken in by a kind couple they love her dearly despite their plan of wanting to adopt a boy earlier the girl is smart curious and energetic with a head full of ideas and imaginations she makes friends and charms adults she does excellent in school and is loved by everyone  it is a cute happy little story which keeps the reader amused the characters are likable but story is a little too straight nothing surprises or is different about it to keep it memorable  it makes a good evening read but there is really not much in this story to talk about yep evidently  some classics just are not for me this is one of them  we start off with yearold orphan anne shirley and as bad as this is gonna sound but i know why shes an orphan i would have either murdered her or given her up and faked my own death too in order to escape her she is accidentally brought to siblings matthew and marilla cuthbert who wanted a boy to help them around the farm for whatever reason they decide to keep anne anyway and we thus follow the girl and the people around her for the next  or  years  i really dont mind stories in which nothing much ever happens as is evident from my enjoyment of louisa may alcotts classic what i do mind are horrible characters seriously was this a contest where the author needed to come up with the most horrible child she could imagine dont get me wrong i never liked the saying children are to be seen and not heard and i do like it when kids are creative and imaginative but anne is awful so much so that while im really actually not that kind of person i wanted that girl to get spanked hard and often  its not even that she never shuts up though that was horrible too i was a very imaginative child and i did like to spin my fantasies and tell people about them as many children do but definitely never on this level shes also vain beyond belief which is especially annyoing considering that she should be more humble due to her coming from nothing and having been passed around from family to family moreover shes no beauty queen herself apparently however by her own declarations she only likes pretty things which also means pretty people when she thought about becoming best friends with any girl in the vicinity she decided that shed only befriend a pretty girl she mocks and belittles people for their looks but gets all indignant if anyone comments on her clothes or looks everything is always a drama and if it isnt a drama she makes it so she always acts as if she was better than other people usually referring to her overactive imagination and other people being more down to earth she is silly loud and obnoxious and often not even clever about it although i did like that she appreciated the natural beauty of prince edward island  the thing is yes people did think badly of orphans back in the day some even still do it nowadays and no that is of course not fair towards the children how these children were often treated subsequently was even worse yes i like people with imagination and an appreciation for nature however just because anne is an orphan and good at writing stories doesnt make her the hero of anything there is nothing cute or heartwarming about anything in this book anne is a horrible and annoying brat  it did get slightly better in the last few chapters when anne was  but that was not enough as a saving grace therefore im just glad its finally over and im debating whether or not i shall read the authors biography that i bought some months ago to find out what on earth posessed her to torture her fellow human beings so much  stars generously rounded up in acknowledgement of the times this was written in what it has apparently meant for ginger girls that it celebrated imagination instead of being chaste and the inspiration this has been to many people ever since in a lot of ways i wanted to hate this novel at least for the first few years of annes life at green gables it was a green meadow of paradise in upper canada filled with a ton of minor selfinflicted disasters with anne her worst nightmare   okay maybe it doesnt sound so bad when i put it that way after all arent most of the harry potter books the same damn thing  ah but at least hp had magic all anne has is imagination an abundance of imagination daydreaming and a tongue that just cant stop or at least cant stop until she puts a few years on her yearold self my god i wanted to root for everyone who wanted to destroy her  okay no one wanted to destroy her shes a loveable orphan in the orphanashero tradition and at least she wasnt kicking in the doors of poor goblins to murder their children although she did have a sharp enough tongue to lash the hell out of old ugly harridans who would dare look down on her for her red hair  moving on  yes this is a wonderful exercise in loving the living hell out of the idea of the imagination and how much love and life can be brought into a couple of sexless old siblings living together in the middle of nowhere it encourages all the little children inside of us who were chastised for being forgetful flighty and otherwise willful to the exclusion of anything remotely practical after all imagination is king and its so damn delightful right  maybe if were too sleepy to see that imagination is all around us already this might be a kick in the pants but for me the uptight past is still uptight and giving this novel tons of praise ignores the strides weve made since then  if i want minor hijinx and sincere apologies and silliness i want it with magic please now i am not such a horrible canadian i was surprised to find this spanned so many years i think i would have enjoyed this more had i read it when i was a kid i found anne a bit much her early adventures discovering the area  people are the best bits i really enjoyed ms rachel by far my favourite character shes a btch in the most perfect of societal ways the amount of times i started anne of green gables as a kid and never finished it was too often to count  and so i made it my goal to read it to the end and i did   not bad tbh its fun and anne is a hilariously ridiculous character i quite like her the story is really set on family and life in the past which was nice but i didnt really find it lifechanging or super interesting  most the time the events of the story just follow anne in her daily life which can betiring at times but overall the audiobook was really easy to listen to and im glad i lived the dreams of my smol child self and finished it anne of green gables is the story of a young orphaned girl named you guessed it anne born in nova scotia only to lose both of her parents from the fever at the age of three months anne has grown up in many households never being able to stay in one place for long as you can imagine this has left young anne feeling needy and unwanted and when siblings marilla and matthew decide to adopt a boy to help work on their farm they never expect to get a girl instead naturally their first instinct is to give her to someone else but soon after under the influence of annes pleading they decide that with them is where she shall stay read along in this classic as anne performs in the christmas concert shuns the semiromantic advances of gilbert blythe and accidently gets her one true bosom friend drunk  i wont lie  it took me a while to get into annes story after all this is childrens literature and for me there is very few middle grade andor childrens books worthwhile but because of some very trusted friends opinions i chose to persevere  and im so glad i did despite the rather slow start anne of green gables was a very pleasant and enchanting story to behold  i believe my favorite aspect of this story is annes relationship with her stepparent matthew almost instantaneously matthew takes to anne as if she were his biological daughter to use annes own words she and matthew are kindred spirits i only wish that parentchild relationships were written that way more often in juvenile literature today  thin freckled and with hair the color of carrots anne is ridiculed for her queer looks  but with a bright imagination and fierce determination to be loved and cared for anne soon makes many friends like most girls her age anne is impulsive and highstrung but shes also highspirited and enthusiastic for what life has to offer even if youre not sold on annes character at first most readers will fall for her by the end just as i did i first read anne of green gables when i was a child i really cant remember whether it was after watching the movie or before but i remember liking the movie more than the book and i still have fond memories of the movie so i wanted to read this again to see if i feel differently now but i will still vote for the movie above the book  anne of green gables is a good childrens classic it says the story of anne shirley who was orphaned and who finds a home in the green gables with the cuthberts this the first in the series takes us through her life for five years from the time she first came to live in green gables anne is somewhat a different child being unloved and abandoned after her parents death her manner and conduct are unrefined she is also headstrong and outspoken not the qualities that are deemed suitable in a little girl however she improves on her manner and qualities as she grows up from childhood to girlhood  my feelings for anne is mixed part of her made me like her while the other part made me exasperated like anne herself admits there are many annes in her some annes are likable while other annes drive you crazy but all the while as anne herself confesses it makes her interesting  the story is quite interesting and enjoyable but i personally feel annes story is best suited for cinematic portrayal than reading and visualizing what i like about this book is the humaness of the yo anne shes a natural she tries to triumph over the odds ie being an orphan having a silly red hair and being unwanted by the lady of the house where she lives after she is sent out by the orphanage she wants to fit in and by her loquaciousness precociousness and sheer breadth of imagination she is accepted and finally loved  the book is easy to read that is typical of childrens books however montomerys main strength is her ability to draw your sympathy for anne and youll find yourself cheering for her you dont need to be a young girl to feel what she is going through her battles become yours because you can see yourself in her when she dyes her hair from red to green i say what the heck although i understood that it was out of desperation to fit in when she is having this hatelove relationship with gilbert i felt that gilbert is the silliest boy for not seeing what is inside annes heart when they tragedy strikes towards the end i found myself consoling anne even if i knew that she would be able to handle the situation  like all lives anne has its hardships and she learns some hard lessons but when that tragedy happens her loving natures is at its best set in the beautiful landscape where montgomery has grown up with her own grandparents this story is a charming and enjoyable comingofage novel tll perhaps be a shock to some that i a canadian had never before read anne of gren gabels or watched any of the various adaptations i in fact knew little to nothing about this beloved world somehow this one just passed me by and considering all the reading i had done as a wee child i couldnt tell you why it being a favourite of my blog buddys however was a source of constant gentle mockery and sideeye so she didnt hesitate a moment to recommend this to me when i said i was tackled the twelve books in twelve months as suggested by friends challenge and so here we are  i admit i had some trepidation going into a novel that so many grew up with and cherished and few likely experienced for the first time as adults compounded by the fact that its a classic and obviously written for the time well i didnt expect this would work for but i was surprised how much i found myself enjoying the read  my one major complaint of course were the pages and pages and pages and pages of monologues by little miss anne shirley herself at first it was cute by the midpoint i was tired my eyes started to glaze any feelings of cuteness had expired amongst the endless recitations and constant dramatics and just when i thought id have to put the book down and try again later we turned a corner anne grew up just enough became more introspective there was a lovely passage i forgot to highlight something about how shed pruned herself a bit something she reflected on when other characters questioned why she wasnt as much as chatterbox as shed been and i really appreciated that  not just because it gave me a break from the monologues but because it was such a timely and lovely bit of maturity but unfortunately some of the damage was done and character growth or no i was looking forward to the story wrapping up for now  as for the other characters well ive always heard or seen of things related to anne and gilbert but sans context i never knew much about it beyond that there was some kind of hate or rivalry between them and now that i understand some of it i really adored their dynamic i especially liked how she always stopped herself from saying his name outright and i liked most their little truce at the end of this first book  matthew and marilla cuthbert were the other standouts i thought their differences their dynamic with anne and how everything about what they expected out of this little orphan changed so quickly was sweet my favourite scene of the entire book might be the chapter we first meet anne on the drive home with matthew that stuck with me  while this might not have any lifechanging impact on me the way it has for so many though its still early to say for sure overall i had a pretty good time in avonlea and will definitely be reading on hopefully ill enjoy things a little more as anne continues to get older but really it was only those endless tiresome eyesglazingover monologues that hurt my experience because i was invested enough in this little place with these people to even get a wee bit emotional over a certain sad chapter so that says a lot even if i am a notorious sap  so thank you micky for this recommendation and i hope to add this series to my various goals for the year so as to read them all before the end of  i was quite annoyed with anne found her unlikable and not convincing i kept thinking she was a  year old didnt feel a connection and therefore didnt really care what happened which made the book quite boring for me not until the last pages did i feel some kind of empathy i think the story couldve been like a hundred pages shorter as it is is now i couldnt wait until i got to the end taking into the count that it was written quite some time ago and targeted at a childrens audience i will round it up to  stars im glad i read it but wouldnt have missed out had i not read it and i will not continue the series arriving late to the table i was not aware of the sweet and wholesome story of the little orphan girl anne with an e and her adventures in rural prince edward island but i am glad to have now had the experience of reading anne of green gables  its been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will  even though this was my first read of l m montgomerys series anne still felt very familiar she is a willful and precious child who has a penchant for speaking like an adult yet with the endearment of the child her diplomatic silver tongue would easily make her a mary sue if it were not for her other proclivity for awkward faux paus anne is smart but she is still a childone who experiences tragedy makes mistakes but still presses on nonetheless given her charisma i imagine she also serves as the prototype for many future fictional young protagonists  perhaps my favorite element of anne is her openness she has the perpetual conviction of being positive a survival mechanism of sorts but a determination very much rooted in her desire to understand the complex world around her it should also be noted that the tone can be saccharine at times and i would argue that the reader ought to be in a very specific kind of mood to enjoy the book however if you are in that headspace then this really does make for a very solid read that i would recommend for all ages little red headed anne shirley mistakenly comes to live with marilla and matthew cuthbert an elderly couple with no children of their own they wanted to adopt a boy to help out on the farm and got stuck with little anne  anne makes her fair share of trouble but its her dreaminess that captured my heart for while she consistently means well she rarely makes it through a couple months time before getting into trouble again  the writing is quite dramatic the way anne expresses herself is quite unique and humorous the character development of anne and marilla as she grows older is very well documented i just dont think i am the target audience for this book too sweet i feel this book wrapped up nicely in the end no cliff hangers and i dont really feel the need to continue this series anne of green gables is your standard tom sawyer or huckleberry finn book but with slightly less daring adventures and more worries about ones wardrobe its a story about the coming of age of a little girl in a small village with few but all well known people and her knack for getting into scrapes  when i started this book i admit at first i found annes long speeches a little silly anduh well umm a little stupid but it wasnt until about a  pages or so later that i finally understood that anne of green gables is not about annes peculiar names for ordinary things or her frequent and rambling rants anne of green gables is about growing up about making hilarious blunders and growing pains that we all go through its about all the silly goings on of school children and rivalry and life in a rural setting  lmmontgomery does wonders with her descriptions of the seasons the sunsets the farms the village and the garden my god the gardens they make you want to run run all the way to canada even if youre on the wrong side of the ocean even if you dont know how or ever been their before there were so many flowers and trees and woodsnone of which are marred by annes silly little lecture about flowers being souls or whatnot that have come back from heaven i have low tolerance for poor and dreamy metaphors  being an only child in a city neighbourhood not half as amazing as avonlea its hard to grasp at first the sheer tight knit feel of this village how every family knows the other and they have stereotypes for each otherthe pyes i believe are generally not liked over here and how everyone has everyones nose in other peoples business in this adorably childlike manner it isheart warming throughout the first  pages or so you are delighted by annes joy terrified by her mistakes and you share in her relief when she comes through happy again her blunders make you laugh they make you cry and her speeches amuse you while marillas dry sense of humour make you chuckle  all well and good but why only three measly stars you say well blame me for being over sensitive but the second half goes to rot dont get me wrong there are plenty wholl still like it but not me what i loved about anne were her childlike innocence and eagerness and passion and fury and emotion overnight she grows up to be this ambitious hard working desperate to come first student oh well she had to grow up but i didnt like it  also i think she becomes something of a mary sue in the last bit sacrilege i know but all of a sudden shes very pretty so much so that a certain character says she makes all the other girls look made up and artificial she has many admirers while those of others arent mentioned  not even that of her best fried diana whos said to be pretty she always gets the best marks the best looking guy is pining for her and she also comes across as the most sensible of the whole lot no other female character is this doted upon or admired i may be wrong but she does seem atleast partially a mary sue  but i still recommend the book to everyone the first half is pure brilliance and anyone whos read and like the adventures of tom sawyer should give it a try a children classic that im reading as an adult when marilla and matthew cuthbert a childless elderly couple brother and sister living on a farm on prince edward island canada decided to adopt an orphan to help with their farm they got more than they bargained for instead of the expected young boy they were presented with a lanky redheaded and bright eyed girl anne is an unforgettable character who never fails to make an impression an impulsive freespirit a daydreamer and a chatterbox she is gifted with seemingly inexhaustible imagination that can easily carry her away on true and invented adventures  the luscious descriptions of nature on the island and the passing of the seasons were the best parts i liked best to be honest i wasnt enamored with anne especially at first i found her overdramatic monologues and nonstop chatter irritating i felt for poor marilla as the book progresses anne matures and blooms into a young woman but unfortunately thats also when the book turned to poetry recitals girl fashion arguments over what to wear and study competition between students making the story more boring  this novel encourages the reader to look for the beauty of simple everyday things and proposes an innocent view of the world it will appeal to readers who enjoyed similar classic stories with a strong female heroine eg little house in the big woods and heidi and a little princess orphan anne shirley is thrilled when she is sent to live with the cuthbert siblings matthew and marilla the problem is they were looking for an orphan boy someone who could help matthew around the farm still they begin to fall for anne and agree to let her stay this book follows her adventures of the next five years as she grows to become a sixteenyearold what will happen over that time  ive never read this wellloved classic and i decided it was time to fix that it came out in  so some of the language is dated although there is nothing offensive here i think i needed to be a preteen girl to fully enjoy this book there were certainly parts i did enjoy but overall i found the book more episodic than a real novel that tends to happen to me when a novel covers such a span of time also the events in the second half of the book got to be too much for me having said that i can see the appeal the characters definitely grew on me and i laughed at various events along the way im curious enough about what happens next that i might go on with the series wish i had read this when i was a kid follows all the criteria of all the protagonists i like best strong female independent willful and good also an orphan which i only realized now is a big theme in a lot of childrens lit from back in the day dated for sure but a sweet little read that follows the orphan anne shirley to green gables where she is adopted by the cuthberts an aging brother and sister who live on prince edward island canada in green gables anne has a full and loving childhood with them the book follows her to school and leaves off before she is set to go to college despite all the hardships that anne has endured in her early life she is bright and optimistic and full of good humor great read for any young girl good but kind of sappy how many times did people need their ears surgically reattached because anne talked them off a while back my grandmother insisted that i read this book after her unwilling struggle to get me to read it i finally did i am semiglad that i got around to it it was a good book although it was not quite my style it was wellwritten but it was not one of my favorites kindred spirits are not so scarce as i used to think its splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world  what a sweet kindhearted classic anne of green gables is a childrens book on many a favoriteslist and i can understand why annes colorful dreams and adventures with her friends in avonlea are the perfect pickmeup its hard to feel down as anne muses about the lake of shining watersand again forgets about the cake in the oven haha  but the novel offers more than annes spirit brightening the lives of matthew of marilla because the second half carries quite some emotional events and lifelessons annes ambition is just as much a part of her as her imagination and so the choices she makes near the end feel bittersweet yet they show well annes love for her family and as she says her dreams only meet a bend but who knows where they will take her   stars and certainly a great childrens story more moving that i expected  we are rich said anne staunchly why we have sixteen years to our credit and were as happy as queens and weve all got imaginations more or less look at that sea girls  all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen we couldnt enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds you know that sense of nostalgia that plays a part when rereading your favourite childhood books well i didnt have that this was my first time reading anne of green gables and it wasnt as amazing as i thought it was going to be worth my time though there were definitely a lot of sweet lovely moments i laughed out loud at some points and even teared up a bit annes lively spirit is somewhat contagious but there were also some tedious chapters and annes verbosity  especially in the first half of the book  got to me anne of green gables is a classic and i decided to read it to see what all the fuss was about to be fully honest it took a lot of patience for me to get through it because the language and context was very oldfashioned but thats no fault of the author of course because it was published in  more than a century ago  an interesting character for me was marilla cuthbert she and her brother mathew own a farm called green gables and they adopt a child wanting help to take care of it but when they get given anne quite obviously a girl marilla wanted to take her back thinking that she wouldnt be of much use marilla was generally a person that didnt like to show emotions because it showed weakness but underneath her hard exterior she has a kind and loving heart in the end ms cuthbert raises anne like her own and grows to love her she even shows her her sweet sensitive side i found this interesting because i also know a few people that have a cold exterior and it made me wonder if i actually knew them as well as i thought i did  the quote that stood out most to me was its delightful when your imaginations come true isnt it this spoke to me because well its not a very disguised secret that i am definitely a daydreamer and its quite likely that ill become entranced with a spot on the wall when someone is telling me something very important my dreams very rarely come true theyre very unlikely and when they dont my heart stops and my eyes water because for however long ive been dreaming about it ive let myself think that it is definitely going to happen these are times that i wish i were a realist like my friend drew but when whatever i am imagining does come true then i am beyond ecstatic you would have to slap me to keep your sanity  the book made me think about how times have changed since then and whether or not there are still people as innocent and lively as anne almost everyone at my school has got technology of some sort and people no longer appreciate the beauty of nature leaves turning auburn and falling to the ground is no longer a work of art but a nuisance that someone will have to clean up this makes me feel sorrowful for the future generations because lets be honest too many are becoming socially anxious and arent sure of how to communicate without technology already in  so how will they be in  more years it was fine i listened to it on audio and had major problems with all three of the narrators i used had to move to librovox once my library copy expired sorry to say but i loved the kevin sullivan film version better i am going to listen to anne of the island next as i remember i liked it even more than green gables the first time if i go back to anne of avonlea it will be on kindle i wish i had read this book when i was a little girl just like anne the orphan girl who got adopted and involved in every funny  weird and quirky accident  the book is nice enough to be read in full the things i did not favor are the slow pace of events and the extended description and chatter of anne who was amazed by everything in the new surrounding  i liked the positive spirit that anne had how she indulged all moments of life either happy or sad by full conscious she appreciated and valued the things others considered for granted such as having a home the nature the roses the brook  dresses with puffed sleeves and true friendship  what would our lives be if we cherished everything beautiful around us and neglected what is saddening just like anne its a bit of a challenge pinning down my opinion on this one montgomery is wonderful at making her characters spring off the page and is clearly well read which translates to a text rife with references and a strong undercurrent of romanticism that elevates and enchants the setting   but  but where was the tension my attention was never particularly rapt while reading this because every conflict anne faced was so easily smoothed over sure shes absentminded and has a bit of a temper but shes so likeable that no one can ever really stay mad at her long and shes so talented that any anxieties she has are ephemeral quickly forgotten as she transcends everyones expectations with her phenomenal abilities  every conflict she faces is tied up in a neat bow within a few pages its just too simple idk maybe im a glutton for pain but i need my characters to go through it you know or at least be lacking in such a way that it seriously detracts from their life and potential so that their development gives me that brilliant feeling of catharsis that is in my opinion essential in a novel so characterfocused for my yr old sons school every year he gets a list of like  books he can choose from and has to read around  and do a book report on them i usually make him read them all except evil ones like old yeller this year i realized there were many i hadnt read or hadnt read in a very long time so im working my way through them so we can enjoy them together after hes read them we plan on having movie nights for those that have movies  meh thats my feeling on this one meh i had never read it before and was a big childhood fan of the little house on the prairie series when i was a kid but this didnt really float my boat if 
Where the Sidewalk Ends,i didnt even like this as a book to read to my children no idea why is there a way to give less than one star i fucking hated this book i especially hated the way i was made to read it all through grade school that i was taught that this is what poetry is it isnt poetry this is easy meaningless chimerhyming nonsense  and not even nonsense with interesting language or ideas like lewis carrol or some of edward lear no this is nursery rhymes but without the moral message the wan sugary popsongs of poetry do not give this to your child  shel silverstein is rude and disgusting i hate all his writing immensely im not saying every book should be loaded with explicit piety but ss simply celebrates all that is base and grasping in our hearts it is severely lacking in the good the true and the beautiful i read this book to my kids i never really liked it and i particularly didnt like the giving tree  fast forward january  i saw the giving tree in a store and quickly looked at it to see whether my opinion softened nope i still dont like its message and no little girl should be allowed to read this book fast forward its on someones list of greatest books ofwell i cant imagine what maybe slacker guys how many times can i say i really really dont like this book i hate this book sorry everyone its like kids just cant like good poetry dr seuss wrote better poetry than this taking it too seriously maybe ha ha now everyones going to think i have no soul am i the only person in the world that hates shel silverstien ive never been able to understand the silverstein appeal i guess at  i shouldnt be reading this im sorry i didnt love this as much as i did when i was younger i would never read this to my children so uneducative this was not a good book however it was better than the poetry book i read last year moon have you met my mother the poems were pretty pointless and weird every once in awhile you could find a funny one that was at least kind of clever but usually it was just dumb i didnt like poetry books before i read this and now i dislike them even more please dont read this book it is a waste of your time and extremely pointless id rather read historical nonfiction than this and thats saying something because i hate to read history books the only part of the book that i enjoyed was that it was not very long so i could hurry through and get the book finished quickly i dont recommend to anyone unless you want to waste your life i give this book one out of five stars and thats being generous i am not quite sure why this bothered me so much typically i enjoy the comfort of poetry but for some reason this collection reminded me of a bad impression of dr suess its just me i understand others feel differently but that is simply what i took from it i cant stand shel silverstein i have tried to read several books and was exposed to them throughout all of grade school because i was daughter to an elementary librarian not one of the books kept my attention and they just become an annoyance i personally did not enjoy the made up words and the silly premises in the poems the lack of regular meter was annoying to me children may enjoy some of these poems but i do not find them to be really appropriate or worth recommending to anyone i put this on a gift registry and got it as a shower gift wish i had read it first i found many of the poems inappropriate for children too dark for my tastes shel silverstein is creepy its not very good it was kinda boring i was a very serious child and thought that poetry like this was stupid at least thats how i remember it  in many places the verse models meanness why do people like this boring and rather annoying i cannot remember anything from the audiobook unless it is the never endless ickle me pickle me tickle me too never returned to the world the knew which says something about the rhyme its catchy so catchy it has been in my brain the whole afternoon  i also didnt like the drawings i know im picky still wont apologize lol i need to be entertained by something too dumb for adults too disturbing for children  some of these couldnt even be called poems just a string of random sentences i know english poetry in general can be dull but this was quite honestly just lazy everything in this book sounded like a pothead got high and instead of writing edgy songs on a guitar and recording them with his mates in a garage decided to write them as children poetry  very disappointing first of all the story of the unicorn has already been told by oscar wilde so who knows what other work has also been taken from other authors  i didnt realize as a child how many times the author seems to persuade the reader to consider the feelings of animals that are slaughtered for the cook or how one would feel if one were to be cooked or eaten by animals these are some that i found boa constrictor its dark in here sleeping sardines the crocodiles toothache recipe for a hippopotamus sandwich mestew dreadful someone ate a baby melinda mae and hungry mungry  and i dont know about you but in the city of miami beach the men throw out the trash so i especially didnt like sarah cynthia sylvia stout would not take the garbage out i notice that there are a lot of men feminist when its convenient to them the trash pilled up so high that sarah stout was crushed to death by it  also the childish poem ma and god the author seems to insist that one can question god or their mothers good sense then keep on to read the story of paul bunyan he shook the dirt from off of his clothes he scratched his butt and he wiped his nose yknow being dead wasnt no fun at allsays paul  he says up in heaven they got harps on their knees they got clouds and wings but they got no trees i dont think thats much of a heaven at allsays paul  so he jumps on his ox with a faretheewell he says ill find out if theys trees in hell and he rode away and that was allwe ever seenof paul  i suppose that he found it better suited for him in hell hacking on the devils tail instead of being with god i really didnt care for this book i dont really agree with it from children i didnt enjoy reading it and i doubt the children will    where the sidewalk ends by shel silverstein there is a place where the sidewalk ends and before the street begins and there the grass grows soft and white and there the sun burns crimson bright and there the moonbird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind  let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and watch where the chalkwhite arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends  yes well walk with a walk that is measured and slow and well go where the chalkwhite arrows go for the children they mark and the children they know the place where the sidewalk ends not a good book to teach anyone anything very warped sense of humour needs to be less prominent in the future too many people i know like it because of a lack of education and morals  my skin is kind of sort of brownish pinkish yellowish white my eyes are grayish bluish green but im told they look orange in the dark  my hair is reddish blowfish brown but its silver when its wet and all the colors i am inside have not been invented yet  i love how theyve played with the impossibility of distinguishing a clear colour for humans soul sweet line and well laid out  doesnt it frustrate you when a book kicks off with promising content and it just never reach its early highs  now imagine if there was only  of these highs and that not only it never reached that single high but also none of the rest of the poems even compels you  worse you dislike a lot of them   i wasnt aware this was targeted towards kids if i knew i wouldnt have read it i find the comedy to be either  overdonealaska nebraska to rhyme the stars you will find other poems that fall into this category of deja vuas well but i wont quote them for obvious reasons  cringe teddy said it was a hat so i put it on now dad is saying where is the toilet plunger gone  cringe the poem with light and bulb but then saying the cord isnt long enough to reach the sun also the poem with the hipopotamo sandwich   too politically correct to the point that it feels corny which is not bad in itself but the writing style isnt helping its case in any striking manner so yeah  an example  the poem where the googies are coming and its msg is that they never give anything to the bad kids   i would like to correct myself and say that its definitely possible to make me like a child targeted book if the immersion is well enough to make me feel like im falling back to sweet childhood period  another point is the drawings are not adding anything new to certain poems actually i think those drawings rob the reader from the one attribute of books which is the freedom of imagination  although i will acknowledge they complement other poems as storytelling but never towards a message that made me like it sadly   i guess its for kids and it helps them but again its really not the type of rigid art i personally like to consume they were beautifully drawn though  google lied not a great pick me up book didnt work for me at least  searched on google for a pick me up book clicked on the first result and this was the number one recommendation downloaded the ebook not knowing its genre read the first few poems and skimread the rest didnt pick me up instead i got bored from it poetry is probably not my thing not for now  not for the mood im in at least  open to considering having a read again when im either in a better mood or when i gain a higher interest in poetries dont want to disregard the high praises given to these poems but based on current feelings and thoughts my very subjective and biased star rating will have to suffice although tbh all opinions are subjective so  what is it with these kinds of childrens books and being so creepy parents really should have paid more attention theres at least three poems in here about children being eaten and its not just this book ive found its a common theme in these popular childrens poetry books some of the morals and messaging were a little off as well even that aside im not and never really was a big fan of poetry not good did not live up to nostalgia or the hype i really didnt like this one if the blurb had included the inside reviews letting me know that it was in the spirit of spike milligan i wouldnt have picked it up as thats really not my kind of poetry or humour  unfriendly to old eyes  i have loved this book most of my life i cannot increase the font size enough for my old eyes love the poetry give the website manager a negative  think thats stinky bad
Where the Wild Things Are,where the sidewalk ends is a quick non challenging poetry book i enjoyed this book because the poems were very descriptive and had some great illustrations the one thing i didnt like was the poems that were meant to be funny but in no way shape or form were they funny i recommend this book to anyone who wants a easy read poetry book an assortment of kiddie poems that verge on the funny and amusing can be really pedagogical in terms of heartening children into loving poetry and literature many years ago in a literature class we had this interesting discussion on the oftensubversive elements in childrens literature as we read of alices adventures in wonderland we learnt how so many of the wellloved classics we read as children hide themes of violence darkness pettiness and societal condemnation deep within it kind of tore our hearts when we realized that the stories that moved us were more than mere stories  they become vehicles that transport the authors thoughts and not merely gentle flights of his imagination  the poems in shel silversteins where the sidewalk ends remind me of that period of analysis there are some gentle poems of fun and frolic and other poems that are meant for adults to ponder the meaning of life but there were so many poems that were violent and unkind why would you want children to read of being eaten by a boa constrictor in another you lose your head and find it rolling under your feet in the poem true story the narrator dies because he was dropped in a boiling lake and why would you wish as a child that its a pity that you dont have a cut or a sore  in for sale you can sell your sister and in another a crocodile eats a dentist you get the picture dreadful begins with this someone ate the baby  i rate this as  because there were some poems like love shadow wash the bagpipe who didnt say no that i liked the rest  well maybe i am getting old but i dont want my kid to read poems of disappearing legs and someone eating a baby where the sidewalk ends is an okay book it has lots and lots of small poems in it but overall i didnt think it was very interesting where the sidewalk ends is an okay poetry book this book is nothing challenging and should be a quick easy read for anyone the reason i did not like it was basically because im not a fan of poetry and never likely will be where the sidewalk ends tries to be funny but in my opinion isnt you may enjoy this book if you like poetry and have a huge sense of humor one thing that i really did like about this book were the illustrations because they seemed like they took lots of time to make i rarely ever read poetry but i am trying to get into it more i remember seeing this book all the time in my middle school library so i thought it was finally time to see what it is all about some of the poems in here are great and made me sit back and think for a minute however the majority of the poems are very average and were not enjoyable for me i dont know why but when i was reading this i got a strong sense of deja vu and i felt like a lot of these poems were familiar and not unique even though they are a little wacky they did not have the intrigue to draw me in further for children of elementary school age i do see this being a good introduction to poetry and maybe if i had read this when i was little it would have struck me differently than as an adult overall i would give this poetry book twostars decent but nothing spectacular a kind of mediocre collection of poems it is not the best but hey it is ole shel anyway tempted to give it a  star rating but for now it will stay comfortably on  stars really loved that crocodile and dentist poem tho i loved his poems as a kid would read them non stop but im not much a fan of most as an adult i can easily read this book from the perspective of myself as a child and both the art and the poems would have disturbed me the unicorns are all dead the boa constrictor ate the child the narrator cooked himself and bid his friends eat him in a stew the narrator ate his baby sibling i would have taken all of these and many others in this collection literally seriously and deeply to heart  of course reading for the first time as an adult im still me so i didnt enjoy it now either clearly my sense of humor runs exactly opposite to mr silversteins ill start out by saying that i absolutely loathe the giving tree i think it sends a terrible message to kids about using people or trees and codependency yes i might be reading too much into it but there you go i dont know if this predisposed me somewhat to disliking this or if its just that i wasnt exposed to it as a child but this was just ok for me there were some snippets that i absolutely loved  but all the magic i have known ive had to make myself  he wasted his wishes on wishing  and the one i loved the most was the parody of the little engine that could  if the track is tough and the hill is rough thinking you can just aint enough  i absolutely love that this doesnt coddle kids and tell them that if they wish on a star believe they can insert the alchemistesque bullshit here that they can do anything because they cant thinking you can does not actually equal being able to im all for encouragement but kids also need a dose of reality  but still on the whole this was just ok i dont think ill be reading any more silverstein books hes just not for me i dont know if ill ever be able to think of shel silverstein without thinking of this panel in the last straw    i have never read another book that has so openly slandered a fellow childrens author how did this get approved to be included in the book its so fucking funny  anyways where the sidewalk ends just wasnt for me i think im just too old to appreciate it this does not have any of the magic i remember it having when i was younger i used to love shel silversteins books and poems because they were cute and funny but i was very disappointed i didnt really see one poem that i liked from this book im positive because i outgrew it but it is very strange because i have so many fond memories of his books from when i was younger read more here maybe i shouldnt have tried to read this at  also being autistic none of the analogies made any sense to me just words on paper im going to be honest im not a silverstein fan but my kids like all kids are it was a fun summer poetry pick  stars it was cute its obviously for kids  some of the poems were just too silly but mostly it was cute i do tend to prefer the poems that rhyme as its easier to get a rhythm to it as you read it  i did have the version with  poems on a cd read by shel silverstein again cute  but very much geared towards kids i did like some poems in this book some were very funny i only gave it a two star rating it was ok because some poems were pretty gruesome which i dont really like genre characterization poetry  i dont recall ever reading this book but i feel like it is a classic as it has been voted top  for teaching poetry to students this poem book has various types of poem sonnet narrative free verse etc this book is a collection of poems that take children on an magical ride they turn in to pirate captains talk about speaking different languages collecting things and much more however i wasnt a big fan and i cannot explain why i did find it interesting at all of the childrens theme this book went after for example the poem about hug owar versus tug owar interesting metaphors no doubt  i could use this book in my classroom to describe the different types of poems  i am sure there are many things i could do with it incorporate art writing etc but because i did not like the book i think i would keep it in my library for students to read as they wish i would then bring it out when learning about poems  the overall writing trait i am using for this book is voice there were a number of different poems in this that i could picture what was happening  disturbingstars  i grew up reading shel silverstein as a little girl back when i was real little i didnt really understand most of his poems or his art sadly that is still the case the poems almost all still confuse me and the art still scares me but i must admit it was nice reading stories from my past  my favorites amongst the many disturbing were hug o war pancake sick the crocodiles toothache no difference  point of view they were insightful and quirky but the rest oh boy  i am surprised how i never noticed how much death and suicide is mentioned in silversteins poetry some of his poetry literally made no sense at all short and confusing i mean the poem bangklang is about driving a sharp nail through someones head holy fk how is this book in the childrens section dozens of characters talk about dying in weird and odd ways and cannibalism eating babies  i still remember my third grade teacher reading the class his poetry wow the united states public school system is in the garbage this book was a weird and funny mess but i dont know where to categorize this because i believe this book is a childrens book but despite the silly drawing and some of the silly poems a lot of the poems talk about somethings that i would not think would be for kids while i was reading that was literally my main thought i felt that the poems did not make sense even if they were meant to be funny i just thought that it was just a bunch f words that rhymed or some of them did not rhyme but i still felt the same way overall i did not get the book but i cannot be the person to tell someone how to write their art because they no what there doing with their art despite if i understand it or not i hope you enjoyed my review and took a lot from this happy reading i guess im not much of a poetry lover these also werent funny in my view if theyre for kids poems should be funny or be a fun use of sounds like in bubble gum bubble gum now if these poems were written by actual children they might have been interesting none of these were the case so meh  i read this book bc it was on a lot of peoples book lists see listchallengescom so i thought it would be interesting its a quick read not to heavy on the brain at night it took me  evening to read this poem shows kids they have a different way of viewing life and the earth they seee games and fun their lives they enjoy life without having a million thoughts in their head their innocence is also viewed as lack of responsibilities and always happy and carefree this poem contrasts the difference between how kids see life and how adults live theirs the adult world is something for different and foreign for young children to understand it is often either looked at as something boring and depressing and also harsh and demanding with many responsibilities so heres a plot twist i thought i really enjoyed this book as a kid come to find out i very much do not anymore if i ever did there were a handful of poems that i loved but the vast majority grated at me something awful especially reading it aloud to my little one reading this after the mister rogers collection in particular did it no favors i guess im just not cool enough anymore to get it i remember looking at this book in my elementary school library but i dont think i ever managed to read the whole thing im definitely not a fan of silverstein books i hated the giving tree when i had to read it in university i know the message that youre supposed to take away from it but i dont get that when i read it and this book would probably amuse kids but still doesnt make much sense on top of that some of the poems dont age very well although im not really one for poetry but i can appreciate some truly inspired ones in this book most of the poems were cute and whimsical some were downright bizarre and a couple were a little macabre to be in a kids book but overall the poems were entertaining and the drawings were unique this book was generally nice i went into this not knowing anything about it beyond the main title  so i was surprised to find it was poetry but i do like poetry so i was happy to give it a go however the vast majority of the poems are awfully childish and while that isnt inherently a bad thing it just unfortunately isnt my cup of tea at all i recognize that this book is considered a classic but in reading it now to my daughter i am not certain why dark disturbing poems for the most part and im glad she is too young to understand shocked to find out that i really didnt love this book of poems like i did when i was young there were still a couple favorites sick and what a day come to mind but on the whole not a favorite anymore silverstein must have enjoyed writing this whimsical  quixotic book of poetry it was unnecessary too long for me and it ended up losing its verve after the first third of the waybut still it reads like a fun project and im glad to have finally read it
"Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1)",i was savaged by a miniature poodle the other daywaitno someone protested my review of the giver the other day if you have any pentup rage from that college lit teacher who forced you to think about books be sure to stop by and spew some incoherent vitriolmy reviews are now a socially acceptable site of catharsis for the insecure  in any case one of them made the argument that children need new versions of great books that are stupider because children are just stupid versions of normal people happilyenough the giver is a totally stupid version of a clockwork orange or whatever dystopian book actually its a rewrite of ayn rands anthem  coincidentally in my review of alice in wonderland i happen to put forth my own philosophy regarding childrens books in short they should present a complex strange manyfaceted and never dumbeddown world because presenting a simple onesided dumbeddown world both insults and stultifies a childs mind  however if someone were to say that this book were a childrenized version of starship troopers i wouldnt sic a poodle on them both present a humanbug war deal with the issues of death war the military complex human interaction personal growth and all that good stuff  also both authors have their heads up their asses and there must be a pretty good echo in there since they keep yelling their hearts out about one personal opinion or another however orson scott card doesnt get into his pointless author surrogate diatribes until the second book in this series so we may enjoy the first one uninterrupted  so its a pretty good book for children and like romeo and juliet its easy to see the appeal kid defeats bullies and plays videogames to save the worldin one of the sequels they save the world by making angry comments on the internetsurprising that one isnt more popular here but more than that its not a bad book in general so i guess i dont have to bother defining it as dumbeddown or for kids then again a lot of grownups seem like they need their books dumbeddown just look at the da vinci code compared to the satanic verses or foucaults pendulum or all three compared to the illuminatus trilogy im pretty sure when it comes to stupid versions of things adults have the monopoly orson scott cards science fiction classic enders game is about the fate of ender wiggins brother of the psychotic but brilliant peter and the his beloved sister it is a dystopia in which a child army is raised against the invasion of the buggers which are barely described in the book there are some conventional mormon views expressed thinly veiled antisemitism racism and a bit of sexism through out which makes me want to take the review down to a  or  however the plot advances once ender graduates early from combat school and things get really crazy and interested  there is also a sidestory where the sister valentine and the psychotic peter become newsnet the internet as such did not yet exist when card wrote the book in  celebrities demosthenes and locke this was an interesting precursor and warning about social medias nefarious and insidious influence on current events the phenomenon becomes so huge and surreal that even their parents are quoting them at the dinner table perhaps readers in the s would have found this idea preposterous but recent history has proved this to be uncomfortably close to reality as intelligent as valentine is the description of her character is still flawed in that she is unnaturally explicit with her brother about her period and her sexual development  well unnatural outside a mormon context perhaps in any case i felt it was clear that it was a male writer letting a bit of his taboo fantasies seep into his writing when he was talking about valentine  why is it a classic well because it is sort of a modern scifi reading of lord of the flies combined with a machievelian reading of  i felt that the second half of the book was far more interesting than the first half naturally i also saw the massive influence this book had on say other more recent scifi such as red rising again i hesitated between three and four stars but because of the serious moral failings on behalf of the author ill stick with  stars just like i gave starship troopers i read this book in th grade i remember it so exactly because still to this day i distinctly remember sprinting up the stairs to get to the bookshelf to read the next chapter it is an absolutely engrossing tale of a small boy involved in a big war filled with heartache and camaraderie and betrayal and cleverness  the problem is that orson scott card hates queer people and liberals so much that hes written a number of novels entirely about how awful they are he posts screeds about how gay people should be put into camps he is a hateful bigot and i can no longer read his books without remembering that and almost as bad now that im older its all too easy to see how manipulative the story of enders game is time and time again ender commits a horrible act but is forgiven both textually and authorially because he was innocent of mind and because he was driven to it by the constant unremitting abuse and neglect he suffers from those in authority looking through the book as an adult i realized that enders doctrine which card and the characters he speaks through like valentine or graff repeatedly tell us is morally righteous is to destroy his enemies and then be pitied because his victims forced him kill them its pretty creepy john kessel talks about the problem of enderasinnocentscapegoat much better than i over here  its an excellent essay and i highly recommend taking the time to read it  enders game is a book thats really satisfying while you still feel that the whole world is against you but once you grow up its too easy to see card behind the scenes pulling the strings in this science fiction book earth is at war with the buggers an insectlike alien species that has attacked earth several times    ender wiggins is a brilliant sixyearold boy with a sadistic older brother peter a loving sister valentine and parents embarrassed to have three children in a society where two is the norm    ender is given the opportunity to attend battle academy a spacebased school where children are groomed to be military officers in the war against the buggers though academy students must leave earth and their families for many years ender decides to go the commanders of the academy believe ender might be the one who can defeat the buggers and purposely make his training very difficult    even when ender is the target of jealous bullies he is left to handle his problems by himself in the hopes of shaping ender into a superior selfreliant officer  most of the book describes enders training at battle academy where combat strategies in zero gravity are learned    ender is a good student and even helps train his friends all of which leads to a strong militia any more description would contain spoilers so ill just say the story has some interesting characters and a few surprises  for me the repetitive scenes of battle training got a bit old but i think a lot of people would like this book  there was a time in my life when i wanted to grow up to be ender wiggin and i loved this book for that its about a kid that is chosen as the only hope for human kind and all he has to do is learn how to battle in space at space battle school i have to admit that i did not realize this was a child scifi book until i started reading it and at that point i began to have the same complaints i had when reading the giver or even harry potter and the sorcerers stone they were good books but i want some bad kids and not the kind of bad kids that bully the main characters i want truly unbiased and destructive kids enders game especially let me down when the love of enders life ended up being his sister who he runs away with mixed emotions with this but overall i enjoyed it this is a classic scifi story which has divided my goodreads friends down the middle with some loathing it some loving it some being indifferent but still enjoying it for what it is i guess i fall in the latter  it was easy enough to read with plenty going on to keep the pages turning but never did you get a sense of character development and only a few extra characters were fleshed out to be recognised beyond standard back fill theres little empathy going on towards ender hes not very likeable and elevated to messiah like status from pretty early on but it was enjoyable at times to see him getting out of tricky battles even if i wasnt sure what was going on half the time against the odds  whilst not being blown away i think i will give the follow up novel a try even though the reviews on that are even more polarizing than this i was shocked when i learned that my english teacher was going to include enders game in the class curriculum in an honors level class it seemed like the predetermined focus were the works of shakespeare and homer  not a story about little boys fighting aliens in space after reading the novel i realized that the book contained some deep themes about society such as a mans ability to protect himself and individual rights versus social welfare while it wasnt my favorite book read in school this year enders game provided an interesting look of an alternate future  my favorite parts of the book included the psychological mind games between valentine and peter as well as the maturing yet morbid development of ender there were some intriguing allusions along with the previously mentioned themes the story was well written and i can see why so many people raved about it and its sequels  unfortunately there were several things i didnt like about enders game the most prominent one is how absolutely every character in the book possessed an unusual tone of speaking and thinking okay sure theyre little geniuses but even most adults dont speak in such a sophisticated tone this made it hard to connect with ender and any of the other characters couple an annoying dialogue with average qualities and you end up with unlikable characters  also i thought the ending was terrible horrible atrocious it was confusing and out of character and all over the place  i dont want to give anything away but i intended to give the book four stars until i read the last couple of chapters blah  even though it sounds like i absolutely hated the book it was still pretty decent a contributing factor to my somewhat low rating is because i read the book in school i ended up stretching the novel to last over a month which made the plot last longer and the story slowly segmented i did like a couple of characters namely valentine and alai  sciencefiction isnt generally a genre i enjoy reading so three stars isnt that bad my daughters grade  class is reading this so i thought id read along with them i know my daughter and she will and is hating this shes more of an anne of green gablestype reader a scifi futuristic story about a group of highly intelligent kids being trained to repel an oncoming invasion of alien insects known as buggers one boy in particular a wunderkind andrew ender wiggin displays incredible aptitude for battle tactics and is pushed manipulated and tested far beyond what most could endure with the hope that he will be earths next great savior this genre is a little out of my comfort zone and the mixture of young kids and violence made me squirm somewhat but the character of ender was interesting and complicated enough to hold my attention overall though it felt like a poor mans episode of star trek cards insights on leadership and the development of it were interesting and could have been explored further the depictions of what were essentially laptops and blogging didnt seem very futuristic until i remembered that this was written in the year i graduated from college and was still using computer terminals the size of school desks to do very basic modeling of things like trafficlight timing i didnt like the portrayal of the children as having mature personalities merely because of their advanced intelligence i can see gaining maturity because of the situation into which they were thrust but here they started with that level of maturity and didnt grow in it throughout the book well see how well this one sticks with me before i decide whether to read the rest of the ender series enders game by orson scott card  if its your thing thats okay its not my cup of tea this review had been written as commentary to support a group read please do not consider it a normal review though you may find it interesting the negative comments in this review are directed at the author as a commentary on his style and attitude not a comment about any religious group or organization or what is actually in the authors soul or heart who can see that further my comments about the message and what i believe is symbolic of or in keeping with some message etc is a statement of description not a personal belief other than the comments about violence to children the only thing mentioned here that i object to is intelligent design and even that is more due to the way it was conceived and forced into schools about the country than an objection to the idea of intelligent design which is generally nonoffensive regardless of my own beliefs okay right up front this gets three stars even though i dont particularly like it i gave it three stars because it had a coherent message it had a story lineplot the english was well chosen it was well written and engaging until you figured out it wasnt going to get any better by my own standard i cant say it fails to meet a basic standard of entertainment i cant say it isnt an intelligent read though therein lies some of the problem this book is one part passion play one part scifi bs and one part moralistic hype there are some people who cant see the religion creeping into to this book oh how we choose to be blind its one thing to be ignorant its another thing to choose ignorance and its yet a third thing to be so acclimatized to religious rhetoric and innuendo not to recognize it in a book that quotes the bible every other chapter as the reverend bubba flavl yes say that fast and it sounds like bubble flavorfrom that esteemed production of teen angst captured on celluloid for all eternity porkies iii once said even the devil can quote scripture so lets assume there is other evidence or process to look at than the mere appearance of quotes from and comparisons to daniel and the lions and jacob sold as a slave by his brothershmmm i suppose that doesnt fit with ender any does it first step when an ulterior message is suspected is always check the author out and see if he has an axe to grind so i did enders game is the first novel by orson scott card orson scott card admits that he knows nothing about modern science or space that you couldnt find out by watching space odyssey  thank you stanley kubrick osc also wrote religious plays before he wrote enders game including that well known story of silly young love barefoot in zion and sepulchur of songs and hes an advocate of intelligent design  what have we learned with a look back at oscs life he knows nothing of science and basically has disdain for what is considered one of the pillars of scientific research darwin and the theory of evolution before writing enders game he specialized in a writing format that is second only to poetry for symbolism and hidden messages in seemingly mundane stories or plots i also watched a segment of an interview with him where he stated very clearly that he only wants to talk to people about their religion he then goes on to say in six or seven questions he can usually find out what you religion is because thats when you get angry whats important to you is your religion now you tell me how this guy would ever be motivated to write a book that has no religious value or message for his first book a science fiction book at that from a guy who knows nothing to little about science face it hes not isaac asimov or arthur c clarke hes a religious philosopher and ambassador of his faith the mormon faith his first book is going to have some kind of religious value or message to it you can bet on itnow what message i could imply all sorts of stories from ender being symbolic of the christ child to an endorsement of obsessing over pubescent boys in a shower in keeping with what i believe hes trying to get across in the worst possible ways i can think of lets see how this fits with what we know of enders game god himself who shall come down among the children of men and shall redeem his peoplebeing the father and the son  the father because he was conceived by the power of god and the son because of the flesh thus becoming the father and son  and they are one god yea the very eternal father of heaven and of earth the book of mormonthe book of mormon also goes on to explain how its acceptable to take up arms to defend against attack but states selfdefense is the only way to go otherwise i could go on with speculation that would likely make orson scott card laugh himself into an early coronary but id rather not ill just say this the little bit ive read from the book of mormon justifies everything that ender does in this book it justifies his killing stilson it justifies his killing bonzo it justifies his killing of the buggers further ender himself is also like a christ child why children warriors because the book of mormon says god himself will come down among the children why else would adults look to children for salvation other than some religious belief that drives behaviorthe book of mormon also praises a military commander who executed promonarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of god and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces the importance of peter and valentinepeter represents christian community of nonmormons you see osc is on record as recently as this last year defending mormonism as a christian religion yet for its relatively short history mormons older brother christianity protestant christianity has been a cruel brother and the mormon faith has longed since inception to be seen and respected by their christian brothers despite the cruelty that this older and larger brother has imposed on it valentine represents love come on shes the only one that loves ender shes the one who peter wanted to love him and when he couldnt make her do that he uses her strength to take over the world then love goes with the ender christ childhow many times were there references of enders blood flowing through the water recyclers so that others would be drinking his body and blood too many times to be a comment about the technology im not sure everyone can get everything in this book without being mormon and since im not mormon some of it is beyond me the end doesnt make sense to most of us because it refers to some almost ritualistic and mythical beliefs in the mormon faith of what happens after we die and how our soul goes to the stars to become godlike or gods in our own right its very obscure to nonmormons and many mormons for that matter the end makes no sense to us but it cleans the blood off of enders hands when the buggers forgive him for wiping them out it allows him to play god to the last queen of the buggers and implies guidance by an all knowing power that makes graff brigham young and joseph smiththe old hero from long ago communing with his indian ghost so do i believe this was oscs intent hell no i believe this is how a devout mormon who writes religious themed plays thinks so message no message who knows i can tell you this the reason some parts of this dont make sense to those of traditional judeachristian beliefs is probably because it was written to be in keeping with beliefs of the church of latter day saints so what the symbol of ender represents and the game though that is likely the game of life may be lost on us im sure theres something to bullying descriptions of the stories that are both representative of how the mormon church and its followers have been treated just look up their history they had a rough life and in some way autobiographical though i caution people not to read into that statement it could as easily describe how he felt and how he was treated after taking up lbjs side of a political debate against barry goldwater supporters as it could describe any actual incidents of violent hazing there may also be a connection to his brother being drafted during the vietnam war taken against his will at  to go halfway around the world and fight a strange foreign force does anyone remember how the vietnam war ended a news clip of nixon sitting at a large round table in france with the north vietnamese im on record as liking christian themes in writing from steven james and ted dekker i dont mind references and allusions to buddha islam muhammad confucius and believers in platos theory of atlantis i never mind finding a message in a written work i do often object to intelligent sleight of hand and trickery i dont like people who write a book for one reason then after getting a movie deal deny their original obvious intent i also object to scenes of naked boys playing lord of the flies in the shower writing off the killing of children as okay because it was in selfdefense ender killed two children one in the first pages though we dont learn that until almost the end when hes watching vids of their funerals and i would have been okay genocide of the buggers until card included the last bugger benevolently forgiving ender for wiping them out what are we justifying genocide didnt we find that they werent going to attack again kind of like the indians who play a prominent role in much of mormon history what happened to the punishment fitting the crime does a bully deserve to be killed and though i do not believe osc intended to imply that a romantic relationship between brother and sister is okay the book could surely be used to support that as an example in literature as it is the relationship between valentine and ender was just too weird for me to accept without a lot of salt just because it was sexless doesnt mean that it was appropriate valentine was not enders mother or his girlfriend but she acted like both every now and then imo so im going to give this three stars and call it a recommendable book but not one that i recommend taken as a purely science fiction work this is mediocre at best taken as an adventure story or coming of age this stunk taken as a human story this seemed like osc designed it to piss me off maybe as an actionless action story sorry the book needs the message thats not a message to be seen in the best light by meif you can call it that i could not decide if i wanted to round up or down for now down one day i may change my mind  as in most wars the indoctrination of children into the war program is inevitable add savant and possible psychopathic children and more uses for children abound with early immersion games being invented his battle room was easily a jumping off point for military games interesting how it is mentioned early that there are child limits and parent selection includes genes i wonder what card would have added if he wrote this ten years later when genetic sequencing was starting to get attention  on that point i wonder what his religion background would have affected the genetic story line he hints throughout that it seems an unfair rule his lds religion is also incorporated at the end it is subtle but will be interesting to see as it progresses in the series  the main issue i have is the lack of womengirls again this reflects lds but not  when he was writing women were starting establishing careers in military forces so why not girls who can play the games just as well such a contrast to the buggers who have a queen  good science fiction elements and on another day i might round up to  thought on this for a long while and wanted to update my review i think for its time its a great book but the more i think on it the less i enjoy it maybe ill change my mind again but wanted to update this to reflect my thoughts this review took a while because i needed some time to get my thoughts together this one was definitely a tough one for me to rate i didnt like it as much as i thought i would but at the same time im pretty sure i liked it more than i should not really sure if im making any sense at all  perhaps it had to do with not knowing anything about this book before i picked it up other than that its widely popular and highly acclaimedwhich was probably why i felt a little like the odd one out when i started reading and found that a lot about the book annoyed me at times the writing and story felt really awkward and forced like the author was trying too hard with pretty much every point symbol and device etc spelled out for the reader as if they would not be savvy enough to pick it up for themselves he is quite heavyhanded when it comes to the conveying of the books ideas  it was then i started looking around and saw that this book is considered by many to be more appropriate for young adults in some ways that makes a lot more sense in the end i had to look at this book a whole different way in order to rate it fairly  still some parts of the book were better than others the last  for example was so completely different to me than the rest of the novel that it almost felt like somebody else wrote it its almost as if orson scott card had this amazing idea for this profound conclusion but had no clue how to tie it to the beginning and so simply filled up the middle with a bunch of fights in battle rooms such shallow action is a stark contrast to the deeply thoughtful ending which nonetheless i have to admit made up for my lukewarm reaction to everything else there isnt anything wrong with escapism but there was something about the way this book encouraged narcissistic fantasies that grated on me the lure seemed to be that you should identify with the protagonist which means you are remarkably brilliant and special and anyone who stands in your way is an idiot or psychopath any failures you encountered werent really your fault but due to a conspiracy against you but dont worry theyll get their comeuppance youll beat the shit out of the kids who are picking on you youll embarrass people who doubted you youll be universally admired the only problems youll have will be the weight of the responsibility others put on you and how lonely youll be because you are such an aweinspiring leader that others cant relate to you  to be fair i know the book is deeper than this and the above setup is layered with irony so the more sophisticated reader is meant to take away a more complex message and it does take some interesting twists at the end that gives you something to think about so its probably fair to say the point of the author wasnt for the reader to revel in success and revenge fantasies but i do think thats the lure of the book  this book is commonly recommended for young adults i hope the fans of this book are right and it doesnt just turn them into smug jerks  there are also a couple plot issues that didnt make much sense to me for instance the book features children who dont act like anything near their age maybe i should have just let that go but it was really distracting  while the above review sounds negative the story still did capture my interest throughout and i liked the twists at the end i dont read very much sci fi  confession i find a lot of it quite boring  but a coworker recommended me this book so i gave it a go enjoyed it a lot more than i thought i would its so much more than just a spacealienbattle novel i do not in any way agree with the horrifying views this books author orson scott card expresses and have read this book with the intention of staying objective and to the point  kids strap on your seatbelts because were about to take a trip into deep space    year old ender wiggin is selected to become part of a program that trains children to be battle commanders in humanitys enduring battle against an alien invasion thats the base of one of science fictions most celebrated and famous books and thats literally all i knew when i started this book  ender is not just a kid however he was born on the governments orders in hopes of creating a genius child and he is  he is one of the smartest sharpest children in existence among others like him hes sent to a space station battle school to prepare for command  this story in itself is heartbreaking children are separated from their families and isolated in space trained hard to become calculated killers their mental health utterly sacrificed to make sure humanity comes out on top in the alien war because survival takes precedence right ender finds himself relatively friendless and becoming increasingly lost inside his own mind and out of it  sounds good right except not i would have given this book five stars if it were properly executed but its really not as i read it it became harder and harder for me to see why this is such an undisputed classic the simplistic style is rather nauseating for example and there is a definite lack of explanation and backstory resulting from it theres more of course   none of our characters have any characterization beyond the minimal its basically a bunch of stick figures walking around  the story has a really wide scope and ambition and yet it spends most of its time with repetitive scenes pointless filler and a lot of ominous talking  because of this wide scope about th of the plot takes place in the epilogue and its a good plot too honestly i find this to be wasted potential  our giant cast literally has two female characters of importance and in the end both are thoroughly overshadowed by their male counterparts plus both are characterized by their feminine weaknesses such as too much empathy and frailty  the cryptic video games take up so much time too its really irritating  on the other hand i think this book has one of the most incredible plot twists in the history of sciencefiction and i mean that honestly readers of this book will know what im talking about and it alludes to the title of the book brilliantly it almost makes it worth trudging through chapters of dullness and psychological childs play  in the end although i did enjoy enders game it was in no way up to the high expectations i had for it in fact i think adapting it as a movie cutting out a lot of the contemplation and focusing on character development will make it tons better incidentally thats exactly what summit plans on doing with their film adaptation so im all riled up for that  for those mainstream readers browsing reviews i write this review as a conservative christian writing to a matching audience  this was indeed an unusual book for me the previous extent of my scifi venturing was j grace penningtons firmament series enders game is a bit more hard core and gritty i think i would have enjoyed enders game significantly better if the cussing cut down a little the other intelligent nonhuman life forms bit also made me uncomfortable which i found interesting since the concept doesnt bother me at all in fantasy also this book was built on an evolutionary foundation which launched my brain out of the story and into creation apologetics on several occasions p  with those disclaimers established the story was brilliant my floundering worldbuilding attempts are proved all the more pathetic in the shadow of this book orson scott card writes ender as a child genius but the real genius is the author himself i cant even imagine trying to develop the technology culture laws tactics etc displayed in this story  ender himself was a likeable hero i found him a little difficult to connect with but not at all difficult to relate to  if that makes any sense for example i highly doubt that i would come to the same conclusions or follow the same courses of action that ender did however in the context of the story and as a result of being privy to his thought processes i easily understood why he made the decisions he did and sympathized with them  while i remain uncomfortable with the intelligent nonhuman life forms i found the moral questions raised by the story intriguing from the right or wrong of how ender and the other children were trained to the ethics of killing the buggers the questions of selfdefense humanity and compassion held up to the light by the narrative are quite interesting  at the end of the day i find myself feeling rather neutral about this story i appreciate the brilliance of the plot w
The Count of Monte Cristo,picture this you are nineteen years old with your whole life ahead of you youve just been offered the job of your dreams and youre about to marry the person youve loved since childhood when suddenly a couple of jealous men decide to frame you as a bonapartist a crime which was punished by death or life imprisonment and have you sent away to rot in an island prison i think its fair to say youd be feeling a touch bitter about the whole ordeal  this is what happens to the young edmond dantes when he is betrayed at first by men jealous of his career and fiancee then again by a man who sees a opportunity to benefit himself by sending dantes to his jail cell after spending fourteen years in a gloomy dungeon dantes finally has a chance to escape and seek revenge on those who wronged him whilst also rewarding those who stuck by him and fought to prove his innocence  i always try to read both positive and negative reviews of books so i can understand why people had a different opinion from my own and the verdict on this from negative reviews seems to fall into one of two categories  the book is too long or  they were unable to side with dantes when he sets out with his vengeful aims  personally i agree that the count of monte cristo is several novels in one and im not surprised that it was originally published in installments that being said though the story itself is fascinating it brings in historical elements and combines them with a great set of fictional characters to make a very rich story there are parts that are sad and parts that are heartwarming and it all adds up to a great balance of the two  as for the second problem it is my own personal taste that i love a good revenge story i know forgiveness is supposed to be a virtue blah blah and perhaps it doesnt make me a great person that i couldnt shake the hand of the one whod ruined my life perhaps but i believe dantes suffered more than anyone in this tale even after he had got his revenge and i always did cheer for the likes of beatrix kiddo so when the avenging angel struck i was right there with him  i think it says something when a  page novel doesnt bore me for a second and the count of monte cristo never once dragged as it took me through a plot spanning many years there are several stories being told throughout and i found all of them interesting dantes betrayal the shawshank redemptionstyle time in prison where dantes makes a close friend the historical story of napoleons return and dantes search for revenge its hard not to be enthralled by this complex world and its characters my one complaint is the direction dantes romantic life took in the end but whatever there are over a thousand pages of awesomeness here and if you have the time to spare for this bookdoorstopperpossible murder weapon you should definitely read it revenge is a dish best served cold and unabridged and translated from the french by robin buss  the greatness of this book can be illustrated by the following simple equations  countvoncountsesamestreetmonte cristo cover  whereas the majesty of the count of counting added to the deliciousness of a monte cristo sandwich from bennigans still does not overmatch the inherent kickass value of the dumas novel which is it can therefore be said greater than the sum of its parts both obsessivecompulsive the count and mouthwateringly fattening of monte cristo  similarly  countvoncountsesamestreetmonte cristobatmancolor cover  the coolness of batman once introduced into the equation thus balances the scales probably because the count of monte cristo character is equal parts wealthy ocd recluse delicious sandwich um metaphorically and batmanlike avenger qed  i dont know how i can be any clearer  facebook  day book challenge day  longest book youve read first make sure you find a copy that is unabridged most editions in english are abridged but usually dont say they are not sure if this penguin edition is its not the one i read readers generally think of this as a tale of revenge for me it was much deeper im not a religious person at all but for me this is a book that makes you question the existence of god or a god edmond dantes is without flaw a truly good person and his life is ruined because a others envy him and b he was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence even when he escapes prison and finds a monumental treasure it is years before he finds peace i dont think he ever finds happiness the questions it raises are why are good people so often punished by horrible tragedies when truly bad people are so often able to float through life with all the rewards that this world can bestow the other question dantes spends much of his life after prison seeking the people who tossed into the oubliette  not to get revenge but to punish them he believes he is the angel of god and that he has been freed from prison so he can do gods will by punishing these evil men but as he proceeds in his quest he begins to question whether any man can actually be the angel of god whether its a sign of mania or even insanity to think you can possibly know what is gods will in the end evil is punished and it is because of wheels that dantes sets in motion but i dont think he is ever able to know if he is just another man seeking to ruin other men or if he is in fact the angel of god its a question that as a journalist i try to always remember we are none of us the angel of god all we can do is try to live the best life we can and not decide who deserves to be punished or even ruined why did no one tell me about this book i mean seriously i was about a hundred pages in and i wanted to go find my freshman high school english teacher and inflict terrible intricate revenge on her for depriving me of a great book i figured first i could assume a new identity perhaps insinuating myself into her life id make her trust me and put all her faith in me and then i would utterly crush her mwahhahaha  seriously this was an awesome book i am not a big fan of the classics really  i usually get very bored very quickly with them especially the russians i dont know if its the characters i cant relate to or the writing that puts me off but i try to get through them and my interest drops off abruptly especially the russians god save me from the russians  but this this was  pages of concentrated awesome a grand intricate story of vengeance  and i do love my revenge stories  that i will definitely read again and watching v for vendetta is a lot more fun you know the classic question if you were stranded on a deserted island which books would you want to have well tcomc is my answer without a doubt  not only would the  pages which are full of the most masterfully crafted and deceptively clever plotlines known to humanity provide hours upon hours of entertainment but it would also be a massive inspiration to search for hidden treasure  i am living for a reality where i sit on my hoard of wealth plan the ultimate revenge against my enemies and wait to be rescued as if my strandedness was my decision all along because thats the kind of selfconfidence edmond would want for me followed by the inevitable selfactualisation that forgiveness patience and hope are the best qualities a person can have  this story is definitely in my top five favourite books of all time but edmond dants is the best character i have ever read i can think of no other character who i have connect to bonded with or empathised for more he will always have special place in my heart and on my bookshelf  if you are planning to pick up a classic with a great plot this book should be on the top of your list alexandre dumas will take you for an extraordinary ride through the life of edmond dantes  this novel starts with the theme of jealousy and betrayal which forces some people to frame innocent dantes as a bonapartist he later gets thrown into a grim fortress prison on an island dantes spends fourteen long years in this oubliette from there he learns about the treasure hidden on the isle of monte cristo he starts his second journey to take revenge for all the sufferings he had to endure  i am a person who always believes in gandhis words that forgiveness is the attribute of the strong i am not too fond of reading revenge stories due to this reason the central theme of this novel is retribution still i loved it and gave it five stars because i think the author has done an extraordinary job in this novel this book is more than  pages long and it took me an eternity to finish reading it i think that this is an absolute mustread book for everyone life is a storm my young friend you will bask in the sunlight one moment be shattered on the rocks the next what makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes you must look into that storm and shout as you did in rome do your worst for i will do mine then the fates will know you as we know you  they dont write novels like this anymore thats because they make television drama series and soap operas instead to my mind this novel is the th century equivalent of a longrunning and compelling television series i can readily imagine being a reader of the journal des dbats between august  and january  impatiently waiting for the next installment of le comte de monte cristo to be published eagerly discussing each installment with my friends around the th century equivalent of the watercooler exclaiming at each plot development gasping at every cliffhanger  what fun it has been over the past few weeks to consume the count of monte cristo in much the same way as i watched all seven seasons of the west wing one after another a few years ago wanting to spend as much time as i could with the story yet simultaneously wanting to slow down in order to prolong the enjoyment loving almost every moment of it the count of monte cristo is probably more dallas than it is the west wing but you get the general idea  the plots the thing here dumas and his collaborator august maquet created a dense and complex story the many threads of which are woven together into a most satisfying whole with no threads left loose at the end of more than  pages this is the story edmond dants revenge against the three men who caused him to be unjustly accused of treason and imprisoned for fourteen years dants who becomes the count of monte cristo carries out his revenge after developing a careful plan over many years for him revenge is most definitely a dish to be eaten cold its also a dish which causes a degree of moral indigestion as he comes to realise that what he sees as a divine obligation can have unintended and horrific consequences  its far from a plausible story and its fair to say that the theme of revenge is more successfully realised than is the theme of redemption the plot is indeed totally over the top with elements of fable and fairy tale replete with orientalist imagery which for me brought to mind the arabian nights luckily for such an intricately plotted novel the story moves along at a cracking pace much of it in dialogue which makes for an easy read notwithstanding the novels length  characterisation is somewhat sacrificed in the process of weaving the many strands of the plot together while the count himself is a compelling character other characters are less so and female characters in particular are rather flat one exception is eugnie danglars who has the potential to be very interesting in her own right although not enough time is spent with her for her potential to be fully realised however deficiencies in characterisation are more than made up for by the sheer thrill of the tale  my enjoyment of the count of monte cristo has been increased by it being a buddy read with several members of the comfort reads group it has also been increased by listening to it as a french language audiobook downloaded from  apart from hearing dumas words as they were written there was the immense joy of hearing beautiful literary french including the wonderful simple past tense never heard in regular speech  i cant say that this is a flawless novel and deserves five stars for that reason but i was on the edge of my seat as i listened to it for some  hours as i neared the end i started wondering just how soon i could justify a reread it doesnt get much better than that every soap opera ever produced owes an enormous amount of debt to the count of monte cristo a sprawling messy overthetop gleefully melodramatic bitchslap fest  in fact i propose that the grandest of bitchslaps be henceforth referred to as a monte cristo bitchslap because of the masterful manner in which edmond dants delivers one colossal bitchslap after another to all who wronged him and to those who wronged him by association thou shalt also receive a furious bitchslap clemency shall only be bestowed upon the righteous and goodly  over the centuries many literary characters have aspired to be badasses  with middling to average results it is dants however who can teach a masters class on the topic  upon being accused of a crime he most certainly didnt commit forcefully separated from the woman he loves and imprisoned for an absurd amount of time in a remote alcatrazlike jail our hero begins to craft his utterly convoluted revenge plot on the assholes who backstabbed him it is a cleverly scaffolded plan indeed but it would make even the most farfetched plotline of days of our lives seem plausible that is it is insufferably ridiculous but unbelievably enjoyable to watch unfold  after what can only be described as the most insane jailbreak ever dants spends hundreds of pages brooding and carefully constructing the ruses under which his punishments can be delivered in gaspworthy bitchslaps multiple backstories also unfold further detailing the astonishing depth of his plot while also providing the reader with the nagging suspicion that author alexandre dumas was not playing with a full deck of cards babies are buried and brought back to life girls dress as men and abscond to faraway hotels men murder their wives in cold blood over diamonds paraplegic mutes communicate with only their eyeballs its as if every idea that ever popped into dumas delirious brain makes an appearance in the book maybe thats why its  pages oh is the payoff worth it though  if revenge is a dish best served cold then the final three hundred pages of the book achieve antarctic levels of chilliness the consequences of betraying edmond dants are seismic god help you if youre in this camp for you will be the sorriest sonofabitch who ever graced planet earth when dants points to your rotten conniving soul and bellows jaccuse there is much gnashing of teeth clawing at clothes and raising of eyes heavenward there is much begging and pleading  but mercy will not be granted  because you were an idiot and had no idea who you were fucking with the greatest badass of western literature bow down its been a long time coming but i finally found the time to gather my thoughts on this tome my initial verdict still stands this was fucking great its been a long time since ive read an adventurous novel and even longer that a book with over  pages managed to entertain me from start to finish so turn off your tv log off of twitter cancel your netflix subscription and get your hands on this book the count of monte cristo is the gift that keeps on giving life is a storm my young friend you will bask in the sunlight one moment be shattered on the rocks the next what makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes you must look into that storm and shout as you did in rome do your worst for i will do mine then the fates will know you as we know you the count comes with secret islands a big fat treasure fistfuls of poison serious disguises italian bandits intricate prison escape strategies romeoandjulietlike love scenes and more in  edmond dants a young and successful merchant sailor who has just recently been granted the succession of his erstwhile captain leclre returns to marseille to marry his catalan fiance mercds thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed edmond dants is confined to the grim chteau dif there he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the isle of monte cristo and he becomes determined not only to escape but also to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration  personally i didnt know anything about this novel i know its hugely popular and referenced in other media very often but somehow i wasnt aware of any of the plot points not even the prison break d so you can imagine my surprise by how fast paced and multifaceted this tale was every chapter came with new surprises intricate plot points and overall this was just such a fun ride early on i started rooting for dants and i was totally on board for him to get his fucking revenge but dants cannot stay in prison for ever one day he will come out and on that day woe and betide the one who put him there written around  the count of monte cristo is one of alexandre dumass most famous and beloved novels and was a huge bestseller back in its day the count was originally serialized which attributed to the fact as to why there are so many plot twists turns and cliffhangers in this story dumas had to hold his readers interest so that the newspaper would keep on publishing his book so if the count starts to feel like a soap opera as you are reading it you know why  on the day of his wedding to mercds edmond dants first mate of the pharaon is falsely accused of treason arrested and imprisoned without trial in the chteau dif a grim island fortress off marseilles a fellow prisoner abb faria correctly deduces that his jealous rival fernand mondego envious crewmate danglars and doubledealing magistrate de villefort framed him faria inspires his escape and guides him to a fortune in treasure as the powerful and mysterious count of monte cristo he arrives from the orient to enter the fashionable parisian world of the s and avenge himself on the men who conspired to destroy him  i was not only positively surprised by the ridiculousness of the plot but also by the accessibility of the writing robin buss did an amazing job at translating this literary masterpiece and he can honestly have all of my money i underlined so many passages because they were either beautiful as fuck or downright savage overall dumas writing style gave me serious oscar wilde vibes i know that oscar wasnt even born yet at the time the count was written but pshhh let me have my oscar moment please yes devotion that is the honest way to describe ambition when it has expectations  and whatever philosophers say its marvellous to be rich  and above all to have ideas  i know that the world is a drawingroom from which one must retire politely and honourably that is to say after paying ones gaming debts these are just a few examples of the wittiness that all our characters displayed the dialogue was sharp and engaging and kept me interested in all of the characters whether villain or hero because dumas keeps it quite black and white if were going to be real here i was invested into all of the characters fates  another reason why i was immediately sucked into the count was dumas ability to make his setting and scenery come to life i was amazed by how authentically dumas interwove the historical and political context as well as the atmosphere of his chosen locations into the narrative strap on your traveling shoes because the counts going to take you all over the world the story takes place in france italy and islands in the mediterranean during the historical events of  the era of the bourbon restoration through the reign of louisphilippe of france it begins just before the hundred days period when napoleon returned to power after his exile  and even though i knew only very few about frances political landscape of the time dumas makes it incredibly easy to navigate through and engage with his narrative i am by no means a history geek but i was so fucking invested in the historical setting of the book as it was such a fundamental element of it dants adventure is based primarily on the values of hope justice vengeance mercy and forgiveness it is important to understand why dants was imprisoned what was the nature of his alleged treason why was villefort so afraid of his father being a bonapartist  separating the historical and political scene from the count of monte cristo is like trying to separate salt from the ocean in order to really understand what the counts all about we need to take a look at what was going on in france at the time we know that edmond dantss story spans from around the  until around  we know from danglarss report at the very beginning of the novel that edmond has stopped at the island of elba to retrieve a letter on his way back to marseilles which is addressed to noirtier guess who was exiled to the island of elba right napoleon bonaparte  following the french revolution napoleon was elected first consul of france the french citizens loved him but there were many members of the french nobility with ties to the former kings of france who hated napoleons guts and who wanted him out many of these royalists plotted to kill napoleon in various ways to reestablish the monarchy thats were the clinch between the royalists and bonapartists comes in in april of  napoleon was officially exiled to the island of elba off the coast of italy however a year later he escaped elba and fled to france he returned to paris and ruled the french for one hundred days he was still very popular among the french but napoleons smallish army was defeated again by european powers and napoleon was exiled to the island of saint helena far far away in the atlantic ocean the difference between treason and patriotism is only a matter of dates the count of monte cristo begins right before napoleons first exile to elba and throughout the novel we hear about napoleons armies his escape to paris and about the royalist parties villefort for example is a royalist but his father noirtier fights for napoleon the country is in political turmoil and corruption is everywhere recall how dants ends up in jail in the first place following napoleons second downfall france was ruled by a series of monarchs the novel ends around the time when louisphilippe i ascends the throne and when things are starting to calm down in france  i found it incredibly interesting to learn about french history in such a fun way on top of that having been fortunate enough to have roamed the streets of paris and rome myself i really have to say that dumas did an amazing job at encapsulating the atmosphere of those places im aware that  years ago both cities were very different from what they are now but i cannot help but feel that dumas really managed to depict their spirit i felt like being there myself breathing the same air as our characters additionally dumas never failed to include actual places like hotels or streets and even real people like countess g who was byrons mistress in his narrative to make it seem more authentic fool that i am said hethat i did not tear out my heart the day i resolved to revenge myself funnily enough the count couldve done with a little more romance yeah shocker i know i thought that the counts failed relationship to mercds would play a bigger role although in the end i really appreciated that they didnt end up together because it was much more realistic nonetheless the romantic subplot that we did indeed get concerning valentine and morrel really did deliver dumas went full romeo and juliet on us he basically rewrites that play d  according to valentines dad morrel is not rich enough to be considered a worthy suitor for her the two must meet secretly in the garden ok no balcony scene but still  a secret garden for valentine has been promised to another more eligible bachelor the two promise to marry anyway and with valentines grandfathers help and the counts help they do the counts plan involves secret and super hardcore sleeping pills that valentine takes morrel and the rest of the world thinks that valentine has died as a result of being poisoned but really shes just asleep the count convinces morrel to wait for one month before committing suicide which morrel really wants to do because life isnt worth living without his valentine duh when that month is over the count gives morrel a pill he promises will kill him but the pill merely puts morrel to sleep and when he wakes up valentine is there to kiss him on the lips  so yeah they do get their happy ending which makes this the somewhat happy version of shakespeares play but i honestly couldnt make that shit up as much as i enjoyed the silliness of their relationship i have to say that the cheesy and overall too happy ending of the count kind of killed the mood for me this is also the main reason why i rated this book  stars instead of  i wanted more blood and more revenge at the end instead the count kind of grew soft and spared his biggest enemy to focus on the reunion of these two love birds above cant relate i want to be providence because the things that i know which is finest greatest and most sublime in the world is to reward and to punish although i appreciate that dants finally realised that he cannot play god without severe consequences since by the end of his hardships edmond has grown a serious god complex hes built himself up so high that he cant help but picture himself in the most grandiose terms our naive poor boy for whom we have rooted for from the start has become quite unlikeable in his quest to seek revenge on his tormentors not least of all because he has so few visible flaws that would make him appear more human i always appreciated the moments in which dants came through again and the count displayed some serious emotions  however where the count sometimes may have seen a little devoid of emotion the other characters of this tale really made up for it i think my favorite ones were definitely the whole danglars family they were all such a mess first and foremost mlle eugnie is a gay icon and you cannot convince me otherwise dumas made so many allusion to her being lesbian she is basically the sappho of this tale amongst my favorite moments of her were definitely her elopement with mlle darmilly her crossdressing and her complete and utter disinterest in marrying the men her father propositioned to her eugnie was so headstrong and independent she basically said that she just wants to be free in heart body and soul like yas bitch which was such a breath of fresh air compared to the other female characters who were either quite pure and angellike eg valentine or very hysterical  and even though they were little shitheads i absolutely adored the relationship of eugnies parents  the baron danglars and his wife hermione the two of them basically hated each others guts and the only reason why they stayed together is for prestige and to not offend the publics opinion they are both super rich and pretty much into gambling d danglars knows that his wife is cheating on him and he truly doesnt care but as soon as he realised that hermione was trying to get to his money for her lover he fucking snapped and served me the most scalding hot tea i ever saw i let you you see it doesnt matter to me as long as you are paying for your lessons out of your own pocket but i now see that you are dipping into mine and that your further education might cost me as mich as seven hundred thousand franc a month woah madame it cant go on like this either the diplomat will have to start giving his  lessons for nothing and i shall put up with him or he will not be allowed to set foot again in my house do you understand like omg if words could kill hermione would be six feet under by now  on top of that i liked how cleverly dumas spun this web of characters everyone was somehow connected to one another which made the stakes even more higher and made his various reveals and plot twists even more exciting when you compare the sorrows of real life to the pleasures of the imaginary one you will never want to live again only to dream forever as for our author dumas dad was a soldier in napoleons army but he fell out of favor there when new racist laws were established barring men of color from serving and the family became very poor dumas paternal grandparents were a french soldier who was stationed in haiti and a former slave dumas dad died when he was three and his mother struggled to make ends meet she didnt have enough money to give dumas a really good education but dumas learned to read and then read as much as he possibly could despite their poverty dumas family still had connections to french nobility and so when dumas was twenty years old he moved to the big city of paris and started working for the duc dorleans at the palais royal the duc dorleans was kind of a big darn deal since he in  tok the throne becoming king louisphilippe i   just like his victorian pendant charles dickens dumas became one of the first french writers who could actually be considered a celebrity of his time he made a shitton of cash which he spend so lavishly by even ordering the construction of his own chteau de monte cristo that he was actually in debt very often which he tried to avoid paying by going abroad mood his life was as tumultuous as the plot of his novels i can definitely see myself reading more from him  is the year i get to my backlist and reread some of the classics i havent visited in years its been over a decade since i last read the count of monte cristo which is easily my favorite classic novel to date looking forward to taking my time through this one alongside my other reads i generally dont read classics its only in last  years that i have started collecting these lovely penguin classics editions and i emphasis here on collecting as it is easier than reading but now i have been slowly going through my physical bookshelf last year i read david copperfield and this year its idiot and now this okay i started idiot and cristo last year and finally finished reading them this year  finishing this tome was a real challenge as you get to know within few chapters that it will be a revenge story there are plot twists that one would guess about miles ahead the character at times felt shallow and sometimes it seems like things were exaggerated for no reason but would i change this for anything else no because it would feel like you have cut an essential limb from the body  it is scary to see how close dumas has come to predict the future through this story he talks about betrayal corruption jealousy politics and love in this book and even after  years society has not changed if possible things has gotten worse  with a length of  pages and utterly predictable this book is still an amazing adventure to go on i rolled my eyes at times giggled like a child felt angry for injustice and fist bumped in the air yelling yes this story made me feel so many emotions and its a story that will stay with me forever whew i do believe this is the longest book that ive read  clocking at around  pages on my ole kindle its a beast of a book honestly this is not something to be taken lightly if you take on this masterpiece  not only is it huge but its a classic so its going to be wordy my friends they paid authors back in the day for every word that was written so my dear alexandre dumas he got bank with this tome  the count of monte cristo has always been on my bucket list for completing so late one night after drinking multiple glasses of wine  i said fuck it lets do this yeah it was a lot of liquid courage  and it was a journey folks  the count of monte cristo is not a book to finish in a day or even a week its a journey of revenge redemption and hope its a journey to take down your enemies in a frightening and calculating way does my beloved edmond dants find love again does he get revenge for being betrayed and framed   well if youve seen multiple movies of this plot over the years then you already know some of these answers  what i did not realize is that the movies are not remotely like this beast of a book there is so much more calculating more characters good grief the amount of characterswhew and plot points that are completely different yes to books now that ive read this i prefer this tale instead of the hollywood version its much more believable and the too convient plot is taken out  some word of advice  you might struggle with this book if youre not into classics you might also struggle in the middle with all the characters and plotting you know why because you cant see the ending and all the precise
The Color Purple,i believe god is everything say shug everything that is or ever will be and when you can feel that and be happy to feel that youve found him  the color purple is a powerful book with an amazing cast of strong female characters but in my opinion it was  pages too short i can certainly see how this book made such an impact by its discussion of painful topics and its feminist messages but it was mainly the second half that brought this book down to its  starrating  the first half of this book was wonderful i loved reading about celie shug avery sofia and mary agnes squeak and how each of them found the strength to stand up for themselves their attempts as black women to fight the sexism and male oppression present in their society are met with anger and a lot of protest but the women all help each other to improve their lives alice walker does an amazing job at weaving timeless feminist ideas together with themes like lgbtqculture the struggle with domestic abuse and female sexuality a running topic through the book is celies relationship with god who for a long time is her only confidant thanks to an important talk with shug  one of the most important talks in this book  the author shows not only how racism and sexism has affected celies image of god as an old white man but also how wrong it is to search for god in a church  heres the thing say shug the thing i believe god is inside you and inside everybody else you come into the world with god but only them that search for it inside find it   the second half of this book however when netties letters from africa take over and the narrative gets divided between celie and nettie was when things started going downhill for me the book changes from a comingofpower story into an epistolary novel which killed the storys energy and realness because there is no sense of time in these letters no conformation that the sisters receive each others messages for all we know celie and nettie are writing these letters to themselves with each other in mind so when the end of this book came and we suddenly find out that   years had passed i was shocked when did time went by so quickly  and apart from the adventure described in those letters  an interesting tale about former african slaves returning to africa and the culture clash that shows itself there  the story is told in an incredibly slow pace and without any vigor walker wants to make so many statements that celies storyline gets drowned under the authors messages about oppression sexism and racism this way the second half of this book lacks the power that was so present earlier making reading about netties missionary work in africa and celies sowing business in georgia a drag for me  so although im a great fan of all the female characters in this novel and how they all found love and happiness the second half was a letdown the story had no impact anymore and celies ending was a little too good to be true i especially disliked how she ended things with mister i do however certainly recommend this story walkers story is filled with excellent messages about feminism faith the power of sisterhood fighting abuse and learning how to stand up for yourself i give this book  stars because i think the author overdid herself in the second half of the novel but overall i found this a very powerful book  man corrupts everything say shug he on your box of grits in your head and all over the radio he try to make you think he everywhere soon as you think he everywhere you think he god but he aint whenever you trying to pray and man plop himself on the other end of it tell him to go lost say shug conjure up flowers wind water a big rock but this hard work let me tell you man been there so long he dont want to budge he threaten lighting floods and earthquakes us fight i hardly pray at all every time i conjure up a rock i throw it  amen the color purple wasnt bad and i understand its significance especially at the time it was published however i did not feel much and i felt indifferent towards the characters except maybe nettie the writing style certainly affected my experience at first at least im not an english native speaker and reading the heavily accented words was a bit challenging at first it got better once i was used to it it doesnt mean this is not a good book by any means i get why its beloved by many and women empowering it has a powerful message and tackles many issues in society but i kinda expected better  i dont regret reading it but sadly it didnt mean anything to me after finishing it i realized that it didnt leave anything with me and ill be forgetting it eventually given the mostly positive reviews i think everyone should read it and decide for themselves but i wouldnt be personally recommending it for someone looking for a feminist and enjoyable book i understand why objectively it is beloved but subjectively speaking it was okay and thats about it this is one of those books i struggle to assign a rating to  on one hand i realize its importance on the other hand i didnt fall in love with it the way i hoped i would  upon finishing i found that my mind wasnt analyzing the book as per usual i just couldnt think of much to say one way or the other  i enjoyed the story as it was written with a distinct air of authenticity lots of wonderful themes  philosophies throughout but it just didnt resonate im afraid  ill leave you with this try the book out  see for yourself if you like it it wasnt a home run for me but many other people continue to be profoundly affected by this tale  so i definitely think its worth checking out walkers characterization is one of the best ive encountered so far in my reading there are many memorable characters in this book the color purple that i will probably remember for a long time walkers characters are not caricatures as they are welldeveloped and multidimensional ie not only with both their good and bad sides revealed to the readers but also the reasons why they behave or think that way even the secondary characters like squeak or mary agnes contributes in bringing out the nature of the many main characters such as celie albert sophia shug avery and harpo  there are many themes that walker tackled in this book slavery education and literacy violence religious belief and colonialism for this reason this is a very good book of group discussion although in my opinion they are too many and too complex for a page book composed of  short letters this attempt left most of the complexities untouched and the insights inexact or halfbaked for example shug telling celie that god is in the trees and it is okay to enjoy the things that god created including sex even without the mentioning anything about marriage or love can be misleading to readers especially the young and the uninformed however the effort was there and i still enjoyed having all those theme presented to me while reading when i finally closed the book i did not feel unsatisfied really but you know that feeling when you are standing in front of the buffet table and you still have that small space in your tummy and you dont want to go for dessert because it is fattening you have tasted all the courses but you want to go for a second small serving and you dont know which one to take i had that feeling this morning while constructing this review in my mind  the other small complaint that i felt this morning when i finished the book was that the beginning was dramatic and totally engaging the middle part was full of twists revelations and endeavors but the ending was something that felt contrived and unrealistic in my taste how could it be that happy after all what the characters have gone through it all became a bit of an escapist book for me instead of what i thought it to be as deep and literary not that i wanted to dampen the mood of the readers or not to picture hope in the gloom of georgia during that sad phase in american history but hey if life is fair then we should have been beaming smiling and even giggling everyday right however this is not walkers fault and i know that this won the pulitzer and national book award on the same year and being the first black woman recipient of those walker made history but still i prefer my favorite novels to be realistic and sincere i dont care if i end up sad and neurotic for few days after reading a book as long as it is breathtakingly beautifully written  sad na kung sad  thanks to christine blue and po for being my reading buddies for this book  thanks also goes to angus and jzhunagev for the encouragement to pick and read this  thank you god for not sending me to earth as a black man during the early th century in georgia i would not surely know how to behave as a black man if i got married to somebody like sophia  there were so many important issues highlighted in this book and i can see why it is so wellloved but it just didnt grip me emotionally in the way i hoped it would i also didnt fall in love with the characters in the way i hoped i would  i understand why the writing style is used and i applaud alice walker for writing through the perspective of an uneducated woman which i think makes this book powerful however this just didnt work for me as i found it frustrating to read and difficult to visualise although you do get used to the language used i think that perhaps an audiobook would be easier if you didnt want such a heavy read a book which opens with a fourteen year old girl being raped by her stepfather seems to be setting itself up in a certain way hardhitting powerful emotive so how did this ever morph into something that can end with everyone in a lovingandforgiving grouphug and celebrating the miracle of an extended and mutuallyloving family the tragic beginning turns improbably into a disney ending its cinderella to the power of ten and actually this is more of a wishfulthinking fairy tale than the gritty realist story i was expecting  what i like is walkers use of dialect  it gives a linguistic strength and character to the voice of celie though i wonder if its something more appropriate to oral rather than written speech but so much else about this book left me bemused its unclear from the text itself when and where the story is set segregationera georgia apparently and after about  years have passed the book ends during ww i liked the characters of sofia and shug but they didnt always make psychological sense to me they dont really cohere as characters  its especially hard to understand shugs relationship with misteralbert she loves him he loves her but he beats celie to whom hes married and treats her cruelly until he doesnt anymore and finds repentance and redemption and then they can all love each other  and then theres that utterly improbable centre section where nettie celies sister who has been thrown out of the house by misteralbert because he couldnt marry her goes off to africa as a missionary to bring christianity to the africans while also learning about black history which she then imparts to us and celie through the form of letters that never receive replies because misteralbert is hiding them but that doesnt stop her writing them anyway and then she finally comes home with her husband and various children and joins the happy reunion at the end forgiving misteralbert for his past thirty or so years of illtreatment and joining in the family grouphug from the realistic sense point of view it just doesnt stand up to even the most superficial scrutiny  so this seems to me to be a book driven by a positive agenda which requires the utmost suspension of disbelief there are important things that the book is doing peopling itself with workingclass black characters who are flawed and troubling reinforcing social messages about selfworth especially for women giving public voices to a community and generation more usually marginalised not least when the book was published in the s  i realise and respect that this is a book which is revered as well as criticised and which has been meaningful to so many people  personally i just found the resolutions to trauma violence abuse and cruelty far too glib for my taste and large sections of the story unconvincing improbable and clearly driven by a christian agenda im glad ive read this but im not a great match for this book best treat it as a fable rather than as something more realistic time moves slowly but passes quickly  finally read it i enjoyed the story but overall not more than a three star level  what i liked most was the growth of the main character and the ending what a crappy life she endured only to find herself in the end and gets a sense of peace with her family and companions nice when that happens because life can be a real bitch sometimes as the character shows through her awful childhood and early marriage years poor woman  besides just focusing on celie and her struggles the bond with her sister is a strong one she starts the first half of the book narrating the story by writing letters to god but later changes to writing to her sister when she loses most of her faith besides the sister who almost seemed too good to be true there was the intriguing millie who i ended up feeling more sorry for than anyone when her life took a horrible turn after she stood up for herself couldnt help admiring her spirit and spunk though  shug was a major character showing the obsession of her husband but also celie herself the book was somewhat daring with its exploration of sexuality for the time period truthfully i couldnt bond with shug much but at least the author was realistic with flawed characterization  i realize the point of netties africa adventures was to contrast the difference of treatment with african culture versus american but it took up way too much of the story eventually i was bored with most of that stuff and would have enjoyed the story more if it remained in celies viewpoint it could have been shortened at least to stay interesting and still get the same point across  its a personal growth novel but not a whole lot happens plotwise i havent seen the movie so i cant do a comparison with it  the first half was the better part since the second became weighed down with netties viewpoint and getting a little chaotic at first the writing style was struggle but i grew used to it quicker than i figured i would time moves slowly but passes quickly  finally read it i enjoyed the story but overall not more than a three star level  what i liked most was the growth of the main character and the ending what a crappy life she endured only to find herself in the end and

netties viewpoint and getting a little chaotic at first the writing style was struggle but i grew used to it quicker than i figured i would i remember as a young child my sister watching the movie and crying bucket loads i vowed from her reaction no way in hell i would watch the movie seeing her almost guttural cries fast forward many years and finding this book land on my lap how could i not read it now maybe the book wont be so brutal wrong you really feel the injustice and outrage and you really cant help but feel for the characters poor celie doesnt get much of a chance a plain black woman who marries someone who cares nothing for her and treats her badly celie clings onto anyone who enters her life that treats her half way decently and her everlasting bond with her sister who she gets separated from for many years is heartwarming we see lots of female friendships and bonds come through from their shared hardships the style this is written in takes a little while to get used to but then you really get into the mood of this book which lends an authentic feel that is hard to ignore you feel deep compassion for the way these women are denigrated but the most uplifting part was the bond the sisters held onto which made life for celie worth living for also the ending felt just right and made it all worthwhile in the end although this book deals with a very harsh time in american history i think the fact this book is written in journal form loses some of its impact on me although i enjoyed the authenticity in so far as an emotional pull i felt bad sad and all that but i didnt cry as i thought i might and for that reason i cant give this more than  stars i enjoyed it but i think i may have to watch the movie as i believe it is a wonderful and powerful adaptation of this book nd book of  you ast yourself one question it lead to fifteen i start wonder why us need love why us suffer why us black why us men and women where do children really come from it didnt take long to realise i didnt hardly know nothing and that if you ast yourself why you black or a man or a woman or a bush it dont mean nothing if you dont ast why you here period  there is no doubting this book significance as a book on race especially when originally published in  it is brilliant i suppose my star rating is mostly hinged on my own personal tastes rather than any merit of the books this won the pulitzer prize which usually as a prize i get on better with than any other over the booker whitbread etc  firstly i dislike letters in a book if i turn a page and see a giant letter especially if its written in italics that horrible offputting block of italics i just groan letters appear to me like binoculars the reader looks through the binoculars at the story happening somewhere else but they are not a part of it in fact they are some distance from it in this sense letters completely detach me from the story naturally i went into this with a bit of a groan seeing the entire novel is formatted by way of letters however the letters werent coming in from afar telling some other story they were the protagonists voice immediately telling her own story the letters are written to god and i didnt mind it in fact the start of the book was quite promising things went downhill  what i was glad about then came back to bite me the novel took a turn a character i wont say who is writing letters also and her letters begin to take up fifty percent of the novel as she describes where she is what shes doing and a whole new roster of characters that i frankly dont care about into play the story is not happening where she is and her reporting this distant story suddenly from the halfway point of the book bothered me had it grown from the beginning with celies letters then maybe i would have felt differently but her letters were like looking through binoculars at her story and family happening far away from where i was with celie and therefore i lacked interest  in a way this novel felt as if its entire purpose was hanging off of a certain reveal or plot twist which is something i despise in a book ive felt so cheated before enduring an otherwise boring and meandering book just to get to the big plottwist or shock news it leaves me feeling cheated  as if the whole book is a setup for this great gutpunch moment it also makes me feel as if the writer had conceived this great moment and then desperately tried to fill a novel around it maybe thats a little harsh and this wasnt the worst case ive read other books i can think of off the top of my head that gave me this feeling the blind assassin the sea massively so the sense of an ending maybe partly amsterdam theres a theme  man booker winners  the ending of this novel surprised me though its the kind of ending my mother would like a woman who hates all endings so that is the highest of compliments in my eyes there were merits as well as the ending i liked the voice of celie with the dialect and the spelling mistakes very interesting ones like maybe two berkulosis or some kind of nasty woman disease the writing shone at times but on the whole wasnt mindblowing due to the voice of celie being overpowering it was brutal at times but not as brutal as i was expecting or rather as graphic as i was expecting so that was nice though it does shock you from the getgo im glad i read it but the experience wasnt as chilling or heartbreaking as it has been for others though it did certainly drop more than once i think it pisses god off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and dont notice it  i hadnt seen the movie so i could read this book without prejudice for starters its an epistolary novel and that pleased me a lot because this genre very popular in the second half of the th century is a handy method to tell a story in bits and pieces and thus create suspense and to offer lots of perspectives and introspections and walker did this in a succesful way on top of that the basic themes of this novel are multiple and very interesting the female condition slavery racism and from an individual point of view inferiority complex  its not a pretty picture of the world the protagonist celie offers in her letters discrimination abuse and brutality rule but through celie walker shows how you can deal with these problems by getting to know your own strengths growing through trust and love from others by acceptance of the vicissitudes of life and by an openess to all things beautiful and good and that is what we see celie does step by step in a remarkable process of personal growth with strong spiritual accents becoming a very strong woman apart from that there is also a remarkable message about the complexity of black and white relationships both races are capable of racism and repression and of course theres the striking focus on the sexual aspect of the female condition  on the downside once in a while walker is a bit too pedantic too moralising too educative to my taste but nevertheless this is a really beautiful story about perseverance courage love trust and forgiveness the happy end was not necessary to enforce this message a well deserved classic  a fast yet engrossing read its the story of celie a women who suffers from abuse early on first from her father next from her husband the way she slowly starts to find herself is told via diary entries and letters  the colour purple is a story about many forms of injustice of the racial and social kind as well as the misogynistic kind celie is a black poor rather uneducated woman with little to no self esteem meaning she has to deal with several forms of discrimination these parts of the book are a tough read but during the course of the novel she learns and grows  thanks to various female characters whom she befriends and who inspire her thus celies eventual emanzipation makes it all the sweeter and helps the healing all around  also its an interesting look at all kinds of different family structures  the ones you are related to by blood and the other ones the ones you choose for personal reasons the story of celies sister nettie serves as secondary arc and adds yet another bouqet of interesting characters  i really liked reading this  like i said a well deserved classical tale i listened to this on audiobook narrated by alice walker and i think she done a great job some authors are not good to listen to others know their own work and add something to the story the latter case was true here  first off i had a lot of problems i wasnt expecting i vaguely remembered the story from the film and although i watched it over twenty years ago i remember liking it a lot i was expecting to love the book and be completely blown away after all its everything i like in a story sad depressing dealing with issues of race mistreatment of women all within a family saga  yet from the very first few lines i didnt like it im trying to think now exactly what irritated me so much and im not sure i can quite put my finger on it i liked the story i liked the emotion i liked how bleak everyones lives were yet something wasnt working for me everything together was overkill at the halfway point i even considered giving up the story was really annoying me by this stage as it felt very contrived im sure alice walker had a checklist of misery that she was ticking off as she wrote the sections on africa seemed completely unnecessary and i thought they were included to get a point across about colonialism rather than add something to the main narrative  i kept listening by the end of the book i still had the same issues i thought too much about why topics were included and what alice walkers agenda was which stopped me from really getting swept away by the story yet i still felt emotional when it finished i still felt invested in celies life and rooted for a happy ending for her  so what do i think now i think that alice walker wrote a very clever book i think it captured a lot of attention mostly good some bad and it raised a lot of discussions i think she accomplished what she set out to do thirty years on it feels like a story heard a hundred times perhaps thats the problem i felt hit over the head with descriptions of racism sexism abuse poverty all things im well aware of happening but i dont want to feel im being manipulated to care i care about these things anyway now i just want to hear more of the story to hear more of celie and shug avery more of harpo and sofia more of squeak even more of mister but without the agenda at first it was a little hard for me to understand the book due to the way of writing i couldnt care for the characters either for the same reason  but when i finally got accustomed to the writing style i came to appreciate the beauty of this book celies character is one of the strongest ive ever seen portrayed not anyone can undergo so much abuse physically verbally and still continue on like she did  the color purple will definitely be one of those books ill reread in the future one can never get tired of it i remember loving this book when it came out and read it twice but a few years ago my oldest read it for class and i found so many faults with it that i have to give it a lower rating it was a very difficult book to deconstruct  its not a light read here at all i cried even the rd time i read it this book is not for the faint of heart but its a classic so read at your own risk  okay so like this wasnt exactly bad it was pretty deep and interesting it just like didnt have my attention at all and it didnt help that i was reading this for school i expected to love this book  based on a vague memory of the wonderful movie which i saw in the theaters when it was newly released i didnt recall a lot of the plot but did remember that the characters were full and rich and that i loved the movie because of those characters and here is the thing about me i am a reader who likes stories that are character driven i like characters who are flawed and realistic and characters who make me feel so i expected that this book would be a five star read and unfortunately i was disappointed and i cannot pinpoint why i struggled from the first words i almost quit listening several times this gutwrenching classic is on sale right now over at kindle for only  if you havent read it you should get it here this was my first epistolory book and maaaan it was a heavy read  it didnt help that i was going through a tough time on a personal note so this just didnt help me spring out of it  the story revolves around a few africanamerican women dating back to the s and socially it was a really down point for them celie nettie shug avery sofia and squeak mary agnes are very different individuals with their own story to tell  however the story is represented first from celies pov and then followed with a corresponding supposedly letter exchange between nettie and celie you will understand why i said supposedly if you decide to read the book dont wanna spoil it for you   celie from age  faces trauma her experiences as a child up until she grows up to be a woman is written in a form of a letter to god  her dialect was true to her own self however i truly had major difficulties in reading through her voice mainly because the words and phrases were challenging for me to comprehend i think it was just my experience that being said the authenticity of her experiences were more validated through her story telling  the story is about africanamercian women standing up for themselves in a purely brutal and discriminating social environment it also gives the message that whether you are male or female you really shouldnt be ashamed of defining your role in society  the reason for my low rating was mostly because of the challenge i faced when reading it but the storyline was bomb must watch the movie  the first half of the novel was for me the most compelling there was abuse heartbreak struggle and perserverance i felt invested in celies and netties separation and where they would end up however around the midpoint i felt things begin to drag and the plot didnt move forward as much as i would have liked ultimately this is a story about survival and feminism which of course i appreciate but i would have enjoyed more propelling action in the second act this is a book everyone should read it touches on such important topics like gender roles beauty selfimage selflove race and so much more although i do understand its significance in the literary world i just couldnt get into the story or the characters themselves  you cannot help but feel compassion for celie who is another victim of our world full of injustice and oppression i can only give three stars for this book because the second part felt less authentic to me i expected a bit more profundity of the story i feel like im missing something to be honest all reviews led me to believe this would be some amazing book but at the end of the day i dont feel anything like i wasnt bored reading but i also wasnt entertained  i didnt enjoy the book but i also didnt hate it  i just felt meh about it all the way through  maybe im just further missing the point because more than anything this book just made me a little sad that apparently this is considered a celebration of what its like to be a black woman because its a pretty sad story and im not sure i would feel celebrated if i read this about me granted im white and am very far removed from this story i have only been in the us once  so like maybe im just very much not the target audience for this book to me it just seems like  pages of celie having a horrible life im just sad and dissapointed i didnt get what everyone else seems to have gotten from this book maybe its just my fault for having expectations i also made the mistake of looking up a movie trailer and the movie just seems like an awful adaptation  like the trailers make it look like a happy story  i will say it is very interestingly written i liked the letter format and i liked the use of language i believe its written in africanamerican vernacular english which i have read other texts in but i think out of those i liked this the most the story is also very fast paced and reads very quickly i can also can see why this is an important work of fiction since it does discuss some big topics and i think it discusses them well i have contradictory feelings about this book  there were some parts that i really loved and some others that made no sense to me at all  listen god love ev
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,i remember i had to read this aloud to my mom as part of a school project i finished it and then had to read huck finn to her she begged me not to saying that tom sawyer has bored her to tears and she was willing to lie and sign the form saying id read it i was extremely relieved and mark twain had the cheek to say jane austens books were terrible jane austen didnt make my very sweet mother lie on a school form  this review contains strong language some of it in context of quoting the type of language within the book reader discretion advised  ya know im thinking that classics might not work for me as much as i had hoped  whats it about basically theres this kid whos constantly a dickhead trying to get away from his responsibilities  why it gets star the story is not interesting why do i give a shit about some kid being a dickhead the majority of kids are tbh nothing interesting is happening here either the characters are either annoying or bland this book is very boring nothing particularly exciting happens until one situation towards the end and even then its approached in a way that doesnt make it as intense as the situation should be so ive heard people say this book is humorous some even go as far as to call it a comedy i laughed once throughout this entire fucking novel i really dont get the people that try selling this as a comedy i didnt even catch many jokes good or bad the situations are pretty much what id expect for a middle grade slice of life novel nothing real humorous there this book is very predictable the dialogue is pretty dated admittedly this is a kinda stupid complaint for a book thats over a century old hell that probably happens to the majority of books after a while but it definitely makes the reading experience in  less enjoyable also it is odd because i thought part of the thing with classics is they still work after the so many years ago it came out so i think im still slightly justified by noting the dated things in here the storytelling is not very good the narrator of the audio edition i listened to made it even worse he sounds bored and does character voices pretty poorly though i did find it amusing in a stupid way that huck for some reason sounded like cleveland from family guy and the aunt sounded like mickey mouse so when i visualized a conversation between the two characters in the book as cleveland and mickey instead it was actually more humorous than anything in the actual book this book is kinda racist with things like constantly referring to characters such as nigger jim or injun joe never heard any mention of cracker tom or whitey huck acting like minstrel shows are a fun occasion at least once in the storytelling not just according to characters pov racist dialogue as characters at times go as far as to spit white supremacy bullshit yeah its pretty bad like i would understand if its just some fucked up jokes or in the context of showing how bad it is but nobody stands up against it its done without a satiric or dark humor intent its not even shown as bad its just there  overall im beginning to think of classics the same way i think of ya theyre not genres but they are bunched into a category that sometimes has something good but i have a less than great experience with them in general while i still mostly feel more optimistic about classics i dont usually enjoy them as much as i hope to and this is one i straight up hated earlier this year i read and reviewed another book i have a pretty unpopular opinion on little women i remember being surprised as i found it to be nothing more than awful overrated ya tom sawyer similarly is awful overrated middle grade its poor storytelling lame story in general no humor constant boringness racism and uninteresting characters make this a completely unenjoyable read not for me one bit    ps a little note i had while reading this book i dont support censoring this or any other book but the fact that high school librarians are scared to recommend a horror novel with some fictional deaths if theyre a certain level of detailed or a manga that has a titty in it while middleschoolers are handed this book that depicts racism as normal and acceptable shows that societys standards are fucked this book killed my summer let me elaborate the summer after sixth grade i was young and fresh and looking forward to middle school and then i read this my feelings when i laid eyes on this book for my summer reading assignment are akin to those of old yeller when that little kid shoots him betrayal anger and a bit of confusion this book ruined the best  of the year for me and i will never forgive it to demonstrate the depth of my hatred for tom sawyer i cut out the pages with a razor blade and used them as kindling for when i roasted marshmallows those marshmallows were the worst marshmallows ive ever had all because they were roasted in the flames of hate  oh yeah why i hate it its boring and by boring i mean mark twain must have sat around for hours each day being nagged by his publisher to write a book no matter how bad the quality and the quality is bad this book is so boring that marky mark spends a whole chapter describing how tom got the other kids to paint a fence for him that is how dull this book is they paint fences if tom was looking for excitement why didnt he just play with pokemon cards or read a good book except he couldnt read a good book because the only books they had back then were like tom sawyer instead of doing anything constructive he goes to play in a cave where he loses his girlfriend really really tom have you ever heard of common sense use it i hate tom sawyer both the character and the book okay i think im done i read this as a child and just recently again as an adult and educator i will not bend over backwards to defend mark twains work to keep in a set school curriculum i understand it is wildly famous and a classic however i can not imagine what it would be like to read this to my students of color it villianizes native americans and spanish people and it demeans african americans there are several cringeworthy examples throughout the novel main characters calling them liars saying they are nameless and therefore not as significant calling them sure criminals deaf and dumb sure there are a lot of praiseworthy aspects of this book but because of how hurtful the language can be to children i would suggest using this book not for entertainment nor in elementary schools to people who say use it as a teaching opportunity i would ask what other supplements would you use are there authors of color in your list of resources are there book characters of color that are the main protagonist is it worth the potential harm it would do in a childs forming and understanding of racial hierarchies book are mentors to children its worth picking a different one the adventures of tom sawyer has brought great joy to many people of the world unfortunately that didnt happen in my case tom sawyer is a troubled boy who gets himself in trouble quite often and tries to be a bad boy the author tries to make tom look intelligent by making him able to trick his friends into doing his chores however the author makes toms friend look extremely foolish and incapable of thinking properly which is pretty boring and depressing not only are the minor characters are foolish but so are the main characters which disappoints mean even more since the story follows them somewhere in the book tom is caught in a deadly situation that made me want to cheer for his death and hope the rest of the book is a very long authors note my reason for this is because tom and the other main characters are extremely arrogant which annoys me quite often that i had to stop reading the book on many occasions after finishing the book i asked my older brother why this book is so famous despite its many flaws he said that the only reason why it is famous is because it accurately described how a boy at in that type of setting would act live to summarize everything i said this book is meant for people who like arrogant people to manipulate dumb people and arrogant people who get into dumb situations because thats what the book is made of i dont get it why is this considered an enduring american classic also this doesnt read as a childrens book though apparently it is i can easily think of a dozen th centuryearly th century childrens books and none of them are negative and disturbing like tom sawyer was this written for adults and then repurposed as a book for children its no anne of green gables or little women  i read this because its known as an amazing american classic everyone should read and i figured i should join the bandwagon and read it even though i was familiar with the plot from seeing the s disney movie version of it so many times for once the movie is better than the book  i knew going into it that this book uses the n word but i thought it would be used solely as a descriptor i didnt realize it said stuff like all nggers are liars wow i am not big on censoring or editing an artist but how does that sentence further the story what is lost by removing that sentenceand if it is left in how is it fostering a discussion about race does the teacher then talk about how there are a lot of white americans who think black people are less than they are and still think that way good luck with not getting parents angry with that conversation others say leave that sentence in because it is part of twains story and he wanted it in there hopefully that sentence is not indicative of twains work in general or an example of his brilliant writing reading it was like a bucket of cold water was dumped on my head  then there is huck describing a black man who would share his food with huck he panics that he has told tom this saying sometimes ive set right down and eat with him but you neednt tell that a bodys got to do things when hes awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing ugh i mean god forbid you sit down and eat with a black person gross  i kept thinking about how these comments are just the th century version of todays racism calling all blm protesters thugs looters criminals rioters while excusing cops who murder as just doing their jobs  all nggers are liars not wanting to sit down  eat a meal with a black person  not wanting to go to school with onethey only got accepted to this school cause they are black etc go google college humors great parody commercial for diet racism to see the modern version of white people in tom sawyer  and then there is the animal abuse i understand that in the th century people treated animals differently they were thought to not be able to feel pain because they didnt have souls still reading about the cat tom  his friends tie up tightly winding a cloth around the animals mouth so it cant cry out was not a funny hardyhar moment that mark twain wrote it to be all i could think about was the  indicators of a serial killer  bedwetting fire starting and animal abuse oh that rascally tom  i could not wait for this book to be over i bought huck finn at the same time thinking id read both but now i am rethinking that decision there are many many many brilliant amazing th century classics that dont hit you over the head with negative portrayals of black people or the abuse of house pets i suggest you go read one of those instead this book was not really a fun book to read i honestly dreaded the study guides and hated reading this book because it was very hard to understand and tom wasnt really the main character i wanted to see in this novel i think him and huck finn shouldve never come back and lived the pirate life that the dreamed of and then i wouldnt have to keep reading this book is very hard to understand because of the way that it was written and i can understand that the author was from back then but i really did not enjoy the style and the context this book also uses the n word quite often and i dont enjoy that word because it shows racism and im not all that friendly with racism this book turned out to be a huge disappointment to me and i was so excited to read it all little kids know is be racist whitewash the fence i could only get half way through this book because i found out that tom and huck finn werent jewish and they didnt play baseball what a disappointment mark twain if that even is your real name the most racist book ive ever read my god i was so bored reading this there isnt really a clear story and whatever does happen just does not interest me the book mostly consists of describing the regular activities of children in primary school which i experienced about ten years ago myself except i experienced more exciting things a major slew to get through and eventually i read like one chapter every few days because it bored me so much but i wanted to finish it as its a pretty short book tom sawyer is a book about how tom and his friend huck finn need to overcome certain tings and how they live the life of a pirate the two boys are roughly  years old and are all for adventure and having fun this story is about their adventures and doing whats right  so in the beginning of the book tom and huck want to go to the cemetery to see if they can get rid of hucks warts when they are there they see three men approach a grave and one of them gets stabbed then later on the man who stabbed the other man injun joe claims that it wasnt him so the other man gets put in prison then tom and huck run away and enjoy the pirates life they soon return to end up telling that it wasnt muff potter and it was injun joe  my favorite part is probably the graveyard scene because its the only part of the book that is somewhat interesting the rest of the book was very very boring and didnt interest me the least bit  i would not recommend this book to anybody unless they are a teacher who likes to read boring stuff and views this as a work of art i give it  stars because it is very slow moving and has little to no action i finally finished it finally  in case you didnt get this from those first few words i didnt enjoy this book well i kind of did when i was in a good mood it made me laugh because it was just so silly and stupid i mean at the end of the book tom says it would be a good place to have orgies then huck was like whats that and tom replied i dont know but all robbers do them and if were going to be robbers we need to have orgies too i burst out laughing in the middle of the library at reading that and got in kicked out because it was so loud  however when i was in a bad mood and reading this i wanted to destroy it with a butchers knife it was so confusing and random and annoying and stupid at times i almost regretted getting into the advanced class because we had to read it  i know its a classic and all but i didnt like it and thats simply my opinion  i kind of hate having to rate down a classic because i feel guilty that ive missed out on the magic unfortunately i cant really change my mind i just didnt enjoy this book it was kind of slow and i found all the characters pretty boring the story line was basic and didnt really seem to be going anywhere ill give huckleberry finn a go eventually because ive heard its better on a positive note i did think that mark twains depiction on a young boy and the ridiculous child logic of their minds was brilliant im finding it hard to review this book with any sort of enthusiasm after having to drag myself through  pages of it im definitely ready to put it down for good i just couldnt get into it and i feel so bad about giving it a bad review and such a bad rating but honestly i thought it was ridiculous i hated all the characters i thought becky was the worst she was absolutely pathetic i couldnt stand twains writing and all that oldfashioned american slang etc the ending was rubbish and led up to basically nothing yes i dont go for these kinda books at all and i dont like books about young kids with no serious romance or action so this book was just not my type and was mostly awfully boring you know what i give up samuel clemens is a mysogynist racist braying jackass im not saying he isnt brilliant i mean no wonder you wrote under a pseudonym i wouldnt want to put my name to that work either why this is considered a classic ill never know but i know one thing this is one author where abridged version does right by him yeah i dont think ancient literature is my lingo hey this was an awful book i hate to break it to you but it was dont read this book for fun its not worth it i am just joking its a funny joke  spoilers i read this book last year and i am still in shock i am in shock only because of how bad it was i am so sorry mark twain but i dont like his style of writing or anything hes written i had to read this book for school and i hated every moment of it i thought it would be alright after being forced to watch the movie before reading but it wasnt alright the plot was seriously out of whack twain would be writing about injun joe oh how i hated that man to writing about toms love life oh how i hated becky thatcher then he would just be writing about a stupid dream tom had about becoming a pirate with huck what the only part which i enjoyed was when the book ended so the reasoning to my disliking of becky is because she doesnt deserve tom because tom and huck were made for eachother no but really becky is just a self centered nobody who shouldnt have been in the book now back to what i was saying about the awful plot line the major thing that was happening during the book was that injun joe was on the hunt for tom right first of all that is probably the cheesiest thing ive ever read and second of all that is so cliche but in the book injun joe is shown in the beginning and then at the end it was like the whole injun joe fiasco didnt even matter because toms love life is more important  the more time that has passed post reading this book the more i actually hate this book thanks mr english teacher for assigning this book last year i wouldnt know what an awful book was until i read tom sawyer oh jeez im really sorry if you liked this book please dont kill me i think mark twain is already planning on it its really boring mostly about a boy getting into trouble and not caring ab how he impacts others his aunt deserves so much better than how he treats her he put that woman through so much after everything she does for him i get its an old book but so much racism and sexism also mentions of rape near the end im definitely in the minority here but i genuinely didnt enjoy this classic the lack of plot and the selfishness tom sawyer routinely exuded had me putting down the book for extended periods of time im glad i gave this book a read but its not one im planning to pick up again we had to read this book for school it was a nice book but i dont think id reread it very soon the racism and villainization against native americans injun joe really ruined it for me there were some funny parts and the writing style is good but it disinterested me towards the end i think the adventure of tom sawyer is a really great book because it has a lot of interesting stories in it and you can lean some thing about you life and to do some thing that what you what to dolike tom sawter the adventures of tom sawyer the adventures of tom sawyer a historical fiction book is about a young boy who is becoming more mature it is written by mark twain and it is more than  years old  people are still reading it today because it has an important lesson about growing up and because it is fun to read a lot of interesting things happen in this book the book starts off with tom being a childish boy he gets into lots of trouble including some fistfights getting lost on an island and in a cave causing lots of worry for his aunt and general bad behavior in school aunt polly tries to teach him by telling him to white wash a fence but in this famous chapter tom gets away with convincing his friend to do it toms biggest adventure is when he and huck the son of the town drunk go out in the night to a graveyard and they see injun joe kill someone as tom and huck figure out how to deal with knowing what injun joe did they grow up a lot they learn a lot of important lessons one of the biggest challenges of the book was that mark twain used a lot of difficult language quotes like but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done thatats p were really hard to understand sometimes the chapters became long and tedious i liked the shorter chapters the most interesting part of the book was the romance between tom and becky they were like drama queens in a titanic scene mark twain did a great job showing the reader what it was like for tom to grow up in mississippi he made it interesting with lots of stories about toms adventures mark twain used suspense in almost every page of the book it made the reader keep on reading when chapter  ended with tom and becky lost in the cave with injun joe and sick with the bodings of coming doomats p i could not put the book down samuel langhorne clemens more commonly known as mark twain was born on november   he died on april   some teens most kids and few adults may misinterpret his style of writing because he wrote in an olden style of sang literature he also likes to write in the third person which allows you to have your own interpretation of the characters  the story the adventures of tom sawyer is about a mischiefmaker by the name of thomas sawyer he has many fun adventures like the one on page  tom convinces many of his friends to whitewash paint his fence instead of him by using the great law of human action which means from the book namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to obtain  i would recommend this book to anyone who can handle his style of writing somebody could learn from this book based on his writing style that people used to write in a more difficult style of writing because we are not used to it twain argued that his book was for adult readers but his friends and the publisher won this trash of a book was published as a boys book no way no how get this the final paragraph of the first chapter he tom got home pretty late and when he climbed cautiously at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt and when she saw the state of his clothes were in her resolution to turn his saturday holidays into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in his firmness what the f does this mean to a young reader i can find no reason for this books continual publication and admiration and i wont even get started on the ugly racism and misogyny displayed here this is an example of a book which turns young readers into nonreaders and is one of the worst books ive ever read  honestly while i would say the book is well written i wasnt a huge fan of the story i know its a classic and everything but if you want to read a book that is well written about a young child who gets into trouble i think that anne of green gables is a much better choice  there comes a time when we need to be honest about a book is outdated there are many ideas and social customs in this book that are no longer relevant to our modern values now of course this is to be expected as the book was written in a different time but it is my personal opinion that there are lots of other books around now that tell fun stories about mischievous children and do so without the sexist and racist undertones one must wade through while reading this book i think its time to stop telling others that this is a mustread part of the cannon i would give this book  stars but i cant if i ever have to read this book again shoot me and make sure i am dead i cant stand this book poop on pages no no no nooooooooooo what was this man thinking some people might be like this is a classic novel if it is you cant just say that about tom sawyer but i just did  i am pretty sure anyone who is under  and likes this book needs a doctor so so soooooo hard to read i am not talking words i am talking sloooooowwwwww and poopy poo this book justdont read it unless you have to for school like me i warned you
A Tale of Two Cities,charles dickens is a demanding writer the narratives of great expectations and oliver twist are relaxed and simple when compared to this reading dickens requires concentration and a will to carry on when sometimes the writing gives you a headache  this is a historical novel dickens tells the story of the storming of the bastille some fifty years after it happened unlike most of his work all traces of humour are removed there are no caricatures and quirkiness within his writing this is all very serious material which of course it needs to be but for me this is what dickens does best his ability to juxtapose themes of human suffering poverty and deprivation with ideas of the grotesque ridiculous and at times the plain mad are where his real master strokes of penmanship come through  thats what i like the most about dickens so i knew my enjoyment of this very serious novel would be hindered immediately what we do have though is a strong revenge plot running through the book and the revolt which occurred two thirds of the way in and like the name of the book suggests this is a tale about two cities london and paris dickens loved to criticise society and all its stupid aristocratic nuances here he takes great pains to show that london is no symbol of societal perfection the aftermath of the french revolution placed the british on a pedestal at least to their own minds they could not believe that their own current systems of ruling could cause such a travesty within their own capital dickens shows that the men in power were just as corrupt and corruptible wherever they sit revolution can happen again  i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful prosperous and happy i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants generations hence it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known  description  the streets of paris are seen before and after the bloodshed and all the strands of seemingly unrelated plots are artfully perhaps slightly forcefully woven together dickens brings the lives of a huge cast of characters spanning over two cities and two nations all of which have a varied station in life and political beliefs into one final conclusion and its a strong conclusion though heavily reliant of coincident this is nothing unusual for fiction of the victorian era though it did feel very much like a construct the modernists would address such issues in the next century mainly to criticise them heavily due to their incapability at capturing the essence of life within fiction perhaps they have a point here  so this is a very strong story one that is highly perceptive and intuitive at times as a reader i need a certain degree of entertainment when reading i find that the wonderfully comic elements that are in some of dickens other books help to break up the more intense moments of the plot even jane austen would interpose her narrative with moments of scathing sarcasm and wit for me this is far from the finest work of dickens despite the fact that it seems to be his most popular a tale of two cities is one of the most famous books where dickens shows humans at their best and their worst but dickens descriptive writing was difficult for me and for this reason i could not connect myself to the characters much surely i shall give some more time to this book later it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair  good dickens classic classic purposefully repeated tale centred around an english domiciled french family during the french revolution in which he draws the love of his main female protagonist as the catalyst that beckons her suitors page by page to the blood splattered streets of paris the better of his his historical dramas with one of the most famous opening lines ever written  out of  some how my review of this got deleted which is good because i think after sitting a while i can appreciate the book more when i read it it was confusing and slow and then towards the end really picked up and i was kind of disoriented but it gives a really good view into things in the period before the french revolution learning about it was one thing but reading this made me very sympathetic of the peasants and angry on thier behalf honestly surprised they didnt start rioting sooner the year is  and dr manette imprisoned unjustly  years ago has been released from the bastille prison in paris his daughter lucie who had thought he was dead and jarvis lorry an agent for tellsons bank which has offices in london and paris bring him to england skip ahead five years to  frenchman charles darnay is on trial for treason accused of passing english secrets to the french and americans during the american revolution he is acquitted when eyewitnesses prove unreliable partly because of darnays resemblance to barrister sydney carton in the years leading to the fall of the bastille in  darnay carton and stryver all fell in love with lucie manette carton an irresponsible and unambitious character who drinks too much tells lucie that she has inspired him to think about how his life could have been better and that he would make any sacrifice for her however stryver cartons barrister friend is persuaded against asking for lucies hand by mr lorry now a close friend to the manettes nevertheless lucie marries darnay and they have a daughter meanwhile in france darnays uncle the marquis st evremonde is murdered in his bed for crimes committed against the people charles has told dr manette of his relationship with the french aristocracy but no one else by  the revolution has escalated in france no one knows why mr lorry receives a letter at tellsons bank addressed to the marquis st evremonde darnay sees the letter and tells lorry that he knows the marquis and will deliver it the letter is from a friend gabelle who was wrongfully imprisoned in paris and asked the marquis darnay for help knowing that the trip will be dangerous charles feels compelled to go and help his friend he leaves for france without telling anyone the real reason the mob recognized darnay st evremonde and was imprisoned in paris on the road to paris mr lorry in paris on business is joined by dr manette lucie miss pross and later sydney carton dr manette influences the citizens due to his imprisonment in the bastille and can have darnay released but he is retaken the next day on a charge by the defarges and sentenced to death within  hours sydney carton influences one of the jailers and can enter the cell drug darnay exchange clothes and have the jailer remove darnay leaving carton to die in his stead on the guillotine carton peacefully declares it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known sentimental and predictable in how everyone knows each other and how constructed the story works to a neat conclusion and contrast at the end but the author his sarcastic wit makes up quite a bit  charles dickens has a sarcastic wit in this novel and doesnt hold back in anyway in scathing the french bourgeois and nobility you can viscerally imagine the poverty and wretchedness based on the vivid descriptions provided however the bourgeois english fear for a rising of the mobs is very clear as well at its heart a tale of two cities in my view is less about the french revolution if that interest you primarily id recommend a place of greater safety by hilary mantel perse and more about morality and how people carry themselves under extreme circumstances  some characters revert to an its all business sentiment and quite breezingly make it through other characters turn saint like and faint multiple times looking at you lucy we have someone turning full on ninja assassin at a chateau and a madam who is constantly knitting while the guillotine almost a character in itself shaves off a new pattern in the tapestry of society  the courtroom scene the discovery of the father in paris overdone love declarations and schemes reminded me a lot to a more quick and in my opinion better executed versions of what victor hugo did in the hunchback of notredame there is a death speech and a letter of a chapter long at the end of the book which is probably the most over the top melodramatic writing ive read everyone is acquainted or full on related to each other in the two metropoles london and paris and the overarching plot and desired symmetries completely supersede any sense of reality in the story  still the biting humor and the idiosyncratic characters made this quite an enjoyable read for a book of its age a solid three stars overall  about  pages into this book i was struck with a moment of panic  whats going on here where the hell is garfield  had the lasagnaloving feline been uncerimoniously behead on the guillotine before the happenings of page  without my favorite cartoon cats wry laidback sense of wit these are surely the worst of times  that is when i realized i was reading the classic text a tale of two cities by charles dickens and not watching the  cinematic masterpiece garfield a tail of two kitties  holy crap how embarrassing  against my better judgement i decided to keep reading hoping that at some point garfield would pop up and say something hilarious about hating mondays well fellow readers he doesnt i repeat garfield is not in this book at all  instead dickens is that his real name lol crafts a tale of sacrifice and redemption set against the bleak background of the french revolution  overall i guess its an okay book if youre into the classics sortof thing but i believe in my heart of hearts that this novel really couldve benefitted by at least a cameo from jon arbuckle or something th book of    a good story but a little contrived and without dickens swinging sadness to wit and back again here only sadness and drama i thought id written the full review for this already last year but i never did turns out its quite a forgettable novel too when i compare it to other novels of dickens like great expectations or david copperfield im surprised by all the names i can recall of those the scenes that are crystalline in my memory and how this one has mostly faded away save charles darnay and the ending i have unrealistic expectations for my personal betterment following the conclusion of a classic novel i imagine that ill become more suave at parties a better conversationalist people will refer to me as the renaissance man who reads dickens i will begin to wear tweed almost exclusively and ill slide comfortably into a lifestyle that sees me reading from an infinite library in perfectly temperate climes maybe just maybe ill have a monocle and a pocket watch of course this societal levelingup into some sort of th century professor never quite takes shape and i remain the same if slightly altered regular dude reading books  which brings us to the present review you may ask yourself why would i read a review of a triedandtrue classic when this young upstart has deigned to give it a mere three to that i can offer no reason for your continued attention other than a mild frustration with the classics and my great mistake in tackling this book id also suggest a complete reading of my review before suggesting that i suffer some great indignity for besmirching your favorite dickens novel   first a note on all classic novels in reading classics it is my intention to better understand what makes a book stand the test of time what tricks an author introduced into the trade and selfishly have some literary street cred to that end i spent a great deal of my time three months consulting various sources during my consumption of the novel i found it helpful to touch base with essays written about the books themes refresh my knowledge on whos who of the zoo and try and deepen my understanding of the book see my formal education in literature has largely been selfled aside from the occasional foray into a university course as an undergrad and i try and treat these books like miniassignments  one of the other reasons i had to read outside of the novel to keep up with the goingson of dr manette lucie sydney carton and the rest of the crew is that i didnt read this novel at all instead i listened to the audiobook in what is easily my greatest mistake in tackling a renowned novel to date the language used by dickens is of the time in which it was written and as such did not make for an easy listening experience while moving about my daily life i would listen for fifteen minutes only having to rewind twenty to remind myself of for example the intentions and identity of jarvis lorry this tapered off about halfway through the book but make note this is not best enjoyed as an audiobook  indeed though my starrating and overall experience is more reflective of the audio experience i found that some of dickens quirks were not to my taste for example the depth of understanding and roundness of the characters was severely lacking its my understanding that this is a common criticism of dickens work im not able to say much of lucie manette other than she is a nice woman and dr manette flipflops between tender father and traumatized prisoner with little warning for me the actions and internal thoughts of sydney carton are most developed and it was his takeover of the backend of the novel that kept me hooked  i can also tell that dickens is packing some serious literary heat in these sentences which made me all the more disappointed that id decided to listen to the book rather than read it im better able to luxuriate in extravagant prose when it is in front of my face im better able to appreciate the depth of thought and the crispness of a world brought to life when im able to read a passage a few times over whats more the depiction of the french revolution rolls on from a righteous uprising to a terrifying climate of fear in convincing and realistic fashion  ultimately it was the audio experience that led me to this rating there are many things i really enjoyed about this novel but would have liked all the more in print for me the back end of the novel moved more swiftly and held greater revelations than the front bit indeed though it could be my millennial attention span i did find the book quite slow at the start and contemplated giving up on multiple occasions it is my plan to tackle future novels of dickens with a paper or kindle copy to better appreciate them i think therell also be a reread of a tale of two cities sometime in my future  though ive grown from my listening experience it wasnt the transformative event that i expected all the same im glad to have done it and look forward to diving into more of dickens work given that this book is set during one of my favorite eras in history i was surprised how little i cared about the politics and history there existed a strain between myself the reader and all that was happening in the novelespecially the characters it was rather disappointing but the writing is refined enough for me to rate this as a threestar novel  i also knew the first half of the book was going to be slow and so i shouldnt complain but still it does start off a bit tedious second half was actually quite surprising and enjoyable with some fantastic moments scattered throughout the ending was heartbreaking and equally brilliant  not the best of dickens but im looking forward to more  stars rounded down  my overall experience and satisfaction not literary merits  i read it slowly  three chapters each day not a page turner as i had expected it took quite a while for scenesetting a bit difficult to read in the beginning and i didnt always know whats happening when i reached about th chapter of the book  i felt at ease with the writing thanks to sparknotes for the help  favorite lines  tell the wind and the fire where to stop not me then hold your meddlesome tongue  and of course how can you not love those opening and ending lines of the book liberty equality fraternity or death  the last much the easiest to bestow o guillotine  a tale of two cities  a novel by charles dickens london and paris  the french revolution  eighteen years  a political prisoner in the bastille the ageing doctor manette  released and reunited with his daughter in england  lives of two very different men  charles  an exiled french aristocrat  and sydney carton a disreputable but brilliant english lawyer  both enmeshed through their love for lucie manette  from the tranquil roads of london drawn against to the vengeful bloodstained streets of paris  the height of the reign of terror  their fall under the lethal shadow of la guillotine  brilliantly plotted  novel rich in drama romance and heroics it took me  attempts to complete this book i read the first   times then i reached  and decided to start one more time because i couldnt figure out where the story was going after  when i was about to quit i told myself you can do this as i said during my book updateactivities this is the first time ever that i totally refused to quit a book yes it was a slow burn i could have read  other novels within  weeks but its dickens and he requires patience and understanding and focus and complete silence and a dictionary especially if english is not your first language  but i did not have to use a dictionary for this work  this is when ebooks are so handy  and if possible reading the book while listening to the audiobook version is a great help believe me im not into audiobooks but this was the best part it really helps to enjoy a classic  its my first time doing it and i do recommend  what i liked the most about this book is the humor hidden in the dialogues and some situations but irony and sarcasm seems to be the main ingredients  anyways my problem with this book is that it took too long to get to the point and in my opinion a very disappointing one  its a mad house those characters are rude and crazy the dialogues are sometimes repetitive most of the characters are unlikeable most of the situations and coincidences are unlikely to happen i know its a fiction  no lecture needed here the accuracy of history does not concern me  all i really wanted was to feel connected  this is definitely not my favourite work  give me bleak house or hard times anytime  below is an excerpt from a tale of two cities  is i assure you said the spy though its not important though its not important repeated carton in the same mechanical waythough its not importantno its not important no yet i know the face i think not i am sure not it cant be said the spy itcantbe muttered sydney carton retrospectively and idling his glass which fortunately was a small one again cantbe spoke good french yet like a foreign wellwelcome to the french revolution vive la france vive la resistance  this was a wordy novel ermegerd mr getpaidbytheword definitely sucked every shilling out of this one thank the maker it wasnt my first dickens novel to make matters worse the characters seemed twodimensional i didnt connect with them like i wanted to  i had to trudge through the first two parts until i got to part three now part three was sooooo much better than the first two parts too bad it took so long to get to the good stuffyou know heads lobbed off people screaming in the streets and selfsacrifice for a friend  if i could rate the three parts of the book the first two parts i would give  or  stars part three was a solid  stars so ill give the book a  pfew this took me a while book the first and book the third are easy to get through but book the second was quite slow and made me sleepy most of the time in fact it made me grab the dutch translation next to it so i could get through it a bit faster not that it went faster by using the translation anyway lol  but i have to say as this was my first dickens im impressed his writing is beautiful with amazing metaphors and i definitelly want to read more of his books  this completes my completist completion of dickens novels except for the incomplete drood and i wish it had ended on a better novel dont misunderstand even at his worst dickens is still a fine stylist his prose and gentle humor and tenderness are artistic merits pathetically wanting these days and they almost always save him from abysmal depths with a few notable exceptions fuck you little dorritt thats what almost happens here but cities manages to redeem itself with a few choice characters and a harrowing bleak denouement that stands out from his other novels my criticisms arent cheap the novel is much too rushed leaping across spans of years at a time in a page or two and this really puts a damper on any real character development which dickens excels at the only real characters of any depth doctor manette and sydney carton are secondary characters i guess and feature far less than the others or maybe they do thats the problem what youd consider the main peeps are paper thin and consist of little more than convenient emotional nodes and centers of actions they cant control manette and carton have a lot to think if not a little to do until the end and the novel suffers by not paying as much attention to everyone else again not bad but not on par with his multiple other works also highly quotable geez finally i have managed some time and courage to finish one of the greatest classics of all time i want to literally clap for myself phew that was some lengthy read i must say  i have always love classics i feel classics have some kind of charm that the contemporaries lack so yes i started a tale of two cities out of that fondness well it was an okay book for me i have not found anything mesmerizing here that could make me go like wow  this would be one of those few classics that could not attract me with any of its characters yes i could not make any emotional connection with any of them personally i have hated both alexandre manette and charles darnay because they both tried to hide things they shouldnt have and their wrongdoing actually brought unfortunate events in other peoples lives like sydney carton poor guy  interesting thing is i was actually able to predict the ending as sydney carton visits charles darnay in the prison this reminded me of the movie called the prestige p  anyway it was a too much going on kind of read to me which i neither loved nor hated of course i have read better classics than this so  from me in my opinion it is one of the greatest classics of english literature of course i love this story since i read it for the first time and i think its one of the few truly influential books i purchased a free edition of this book on kindle  tw violence  its been a long time since i last read a book written by charles dickens but this one which gripped me in just one sitting proved that his longer novels could be my next major reading adventure that i go on a tale of two cities is a historical fiction novel set during the events of the french revolution the novel itself is split into three parts each one breaking up the various stages and conflicts surrounding the main characters after serving a prison sentence dr manette is finally free and arrives back home in england manettes daughter lucie gets involved with two men an aristocrat from france who has been exiled and an english born lawyer the last few chapters were thrilling and my favourite section of the novel at times it was difficult to follow but the dialogue was strong and really appealed to me as the reader helping with some character connection this is a time period in history that i would love to read more from this was my first foray into charles dickens works and i went in with much excitement and perhaps too much by way of expectations the book took me much longer than expected to finish throughout the novel at least in the first threequarters i failed to feel empathy with any of the characters it was only when i neared the end that i became more absorbed with the plot twists i would be lying if i said i wasnt deeply moved by the storys ending  was it the wordiness of the novel that put me off maybe not because ive read and liked other wordy authors i think i would blame it on the authors slightly going overboard with sarcasm and sentimentalism in case of this particular novel as well his characterization could have gone a little deeper with sydney carton having said that i still like his ingenuity in patiently building up suspense to climactic heights near the very end on balance i am inclined to give this novel three out of five stars extremely slow going but damn what an ending a classic about life in london and paris during the times of the french revolution in the late s a tale of two cities starts rather weak but picks up around halfway overall i still find it rather unoriginal dull and it is quite a long read at  hours perhaps this work didnt age well it is hard to understand why it has become a classic this took a while to get through but it was definitely worth the challenge i find it interesting to see how novels written in the th century compare to novels written today amid the vocabulary detailed settings and dialogue many of the issues dickens wrote about in his works are ones that are still commonplace today i would recommend taking your time with reading dickens in order to really understand what message hes trying to convey a tale of two cities  i was a bit surprised at how challenging i found this book i havent read any dickens in a very long time but i remember adoring my parents copies of a few of his books i read when i was a small child in fact they may have actually been the very first books i read of my own choosing you know in my free time so i expected a somewhat easy read  while reading it i needed utter silence to concentrate and i had to consult a dictionary fairly often it has only now occurred to me that the dickens books i loved as a kid must have been abridged dumbeddown editions i certainly dont remember david copperfield being  pages  as for a tale of two cities im inclined to say it hasnt aged all that wonderfully its certainly not bad but it feels a little underwhelming in this day and age  i didnt find the premise or plot itself particularly intriguing or gripping and most of the characters werent all that interesting or relatable either the female lead is particularly unremarkable in fact shes my least favorite kind of heroine there just wasnt anything or anyone in this that made me feel like i absolutely needed to keep reading i would have been okay had i never found out what happens to say charles darnay and i shouldnt feel like that  i suspect that what made this novel so wildly successful and influential is the storytelling structure more than anything the sprawling nature of the plot and cast and seeing the way everything interweaves and interacts throughout the different bottle chapters is great fun once youve gotten to know all the characters and it feels very modern i certainly see a huge amount of modern pieces of fiction taking note from it the ending was welldone as well and every subplot tied up quite nicely  dickens prose is usually beautiful but it can also be very tedious as i mentioned it demands intense concentration which can be a little difficult if you dont care all that much about anything thats going on as i didnt i tend to prefer stories to be characterdriven rather than plotdriven i love a a story with an ambitious structure but i need a little more to latch onto as far as characters go to really get me reading  dont get me wrong the characters in here arent terrible but it certainly seems as if theres something missing in them they feel more like little cogs in the machine of a larger story than actual human beings perhaps they simply needed more development but that may have made this book absurdly long this is the danger of a large ensemble cast and few writers seem to be able to nail it  as its dickens and him and i have important history i was going to be nice and give this a fourstar rating but ive decided to just be honest its a three from me i wanted to love this story parts one and three were pretty interesting but part two was horrendous the story was generally great but from sentence to sentence it wasnt spectacular better in its concept and plot than the actual writing this has made me reluctant to take up any other dickens i think his writing style is just not for me there are ways to be flowery and still keep the readers attention and progress the plot while also being highly descriptive this is one of those classics that doesnt speak to me lots of people like dickens i am not one of those people so i wasnt expecting to like this book at all still it was okay really boring oftentimes confusing i got all the characters and different plot lines mixed up and of course wordy the last couple chapters were the only parts i really enjoyed though there were a few exciting parts here and there  still its a classic i believe everyone should read especially if youre studying the french revolution  id have loved it if i read it  years ago but now im spoiled ruined by sarcasm and i have no heart so even though the book was good and i liked it it wasnt special i was constantly raising my eyebrow and rolling eyes cuz people arent like that these days and i found those goodhearted gentlemen and lovely petit ladies a bit annoying so its an ordinary case of its not you its me it is easy to imagine the suspense and excitement of reading this in newspaper installments when it was written in  the character stereotypes are there dastardly villains good knights fair maidens the oppressed and the powerful those chapters would likely be read over and over during the week in anticipation of the next installment unfortunately i found it necessary to do that more often than i would wish sometimes i savored and reread a paragraph or so for fun but more often my mind had muddled and id be lost in these long passages i needed to reread chapters to understand what just taken place i was torn between savoring the language and reading only dialogue for comprehension sake  i must admit though that dickens did a marvelous job with the french revolution and the storming of the bastille a historical event that usually sends me grappling for clarity this was one of the clearest accounts i have read  and the story itself twisted and turned itself to its brilliant though not quite plausible ending of course it wasnt meant to be plausible but rather to entertain and at the time i am sure it did a stunning job of that but in todays world of minimal language and instant gratification this book is out of place can you imagine readers waiting an entire week for the next chapter can you imagine any newspaper giving space to literary wordiness
Life of Pi,it is not so much that the life of pi is particularly moving although it is it isnt even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once which it is as well and its certainly not that yann martels vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin even though they are it is that like bohjalian and byatt and all of the great houdinis of the literary world in the last few moments of your journey  after youve felt the emotions endured the moments of heartache yearned for the resolution of the characters struggle  that you realize the book is not what you thought it was the story transforms instantly and forever  and in those last few chapters you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as well  you feel martels words lingering suggesting and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith  hoping for white light and love or the agnostic who  in trying to stay true to his reasonable self explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms lacking imagination to the end and essentially missing the better story  there is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from india left adrift in the pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his fathers zoo in pondicherry there is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not indeed what the book was about at all there is no use because depending on your philosophical bent the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you there is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grand  read this book not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent it is of course but there are many good authors and many good books while uncommon they are not endangered read this book because in recent memory  aside from jose saramagos arresting blindness  there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements as pi says in his story life on a lifeboat isnt much of a life it is like an end game in chess a game with few pieces the elements couldnt be more simple nor the stakes higher it is the same with martels undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger a simple story with potentially life altering consequences for its readers  as martel writes the world isnt just the way it is it is how we understand it no and in understanding something we bring something to it no like schroedingers cat in the box the way this book is understood the way it is perceived affects what it is there has been some talk that this book will make its readers believe in god i think its a question of perspective to behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements the dry yeastless factuality of what actually happened is certainly one way to go about it but to understand this piece to be something indescribable something godlike is by far the greater leap of faith  oh but worth the leap if the reader is like that atheist willing to see the better story   life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it  a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can  and sometimes stories are so beautiful that souls have fallen in a love with them  a tender quiet love that nurtures what it can  this is one of those stories  its a story that will always have a special place in my heart its one of the only books that has ever made me reevaluate my beliefs on faith it helped me further realise the impact and importance of the connection between humans and animals and it planted a seed of hope that life can be beautiful even in the most harrowing of circumstances  this is the kind of story that will always teach life lessons no matter at which age you read it and regardless of the amount of rereads you will always walk away from this book having learnt something new about life the world and about yourself  it is truly one of the most beautiful stories i have ever had the privilege of reading  i read this book two years ago but when we discussed it this month for book club i remembered how much i liked it a good discussion always ups my appreciation of a novel as does an ending that makes me requestion my givens in the story i find myself reading contradictory interpretations and agreeing with both sides thats the beauty of symbolism as long as you back up your cause its plausible  initially it took me several weeks to get into the book the beginning reads more like a textbook with inserted clips of the main characters future self while the knowledge i gained about zoology and theology was interesting it wasnt intriguing enough to keep me awake for more than a few pages at a time and often i found the tidbits a confusing distraction but with distance i enjoyed the backdrop information it offered if youre struggling through the initial background jump ahead to the second section yeah its important but its not vital and maybe once youve read the story youll want to come back and appreciate his analysis  i highly enjoyed this strange journey at sea and found it almost believableuntil the castaways encounter the island at which point i wondered how much of his sanity wavered being shipwreck is one of a plethora of phobias i have throw on top my even stronger fear of tigers and this was a story straight out of a nightmare one that kept me intrigued for a resolution how could a boy keep the upper hand shipwrecked with a tiger i had a picture in my head of pi clinging to the side of the boat to avoid both the salty water infested with sharks and a foodless boat housing a hungry carnivore  i found myself stuck in the unusual place where as a reader i find a story plausible with full knowledge that had this story been presented in real life i would have doubted its authenticity i wanted to believe the story and all its fantasy the end initially annoyed me but if you look at the rich metaphors in the story it becomes delectable for a story analyst like me there is nothing i enjoy more than tearing apart a story and pulling out the intentions and symbols buried inside instead of just a fantastical story you find a fable with a moral  spoilers here i want to reread the story now and analyze richard parker as pis alter ego seeing that alpha and omega struggle as an internal one even the name richard parker is a hint at cannibalistic roots since it is the true account of a sailor who died at the hands of his cannibalistic crew members i keep going back to that moment when pi calls for richard parker to join him on the ship and then is appalled at what he has done once richard parker has joined his voyage there is no banishing him if they are one and the same they beautifully represent that internal battle between the civilized vegetarian and the animalistic instinct to survive showing the compartmentalization he needed to prevent madness  you would not expect the small boy to conquer the beast whether animal or himself and yet he keeps the upper hand for an unimaginable  days had the cannibal overrun his pysche he would have lost his battle and landed a madman when the duo landed on the beaches of mexico richard parker took off never to be noted by civilians again but alive and surviving thus the horror of the incident will always live in pis memory but he chooses to repress it as it has no part in civilization  i enjoyed the portrayal of the characters on the boat as animals i could envision the quiet maternal sadness the orangutan gave his mother since the crew would be blamed for the demise of the ship the wounded sailor as the zebra lying as prey to a demented and angry foreign chef who is just as crazy as we view the viscous hyena the symbols were perfect and i think a second read would bring out their traits even stronger  some of the richest symbolism comes from the cannibal island and sailor i think pis childlike mind could not deal with the cannibalism of a loved one and lets this theme leak into other story elements the blind sailor is a second portrayal of the french chef a character too big and conflicting to fit into one projection at first he is the mean animal thinking only of his own survival but as the journey progresses pi is conflicted with his friendship for the man a bond is bound to happen between the only two survivors in limited space and pi could not come to terms with his human feelings for the barbaric man so he invents a second character one whom he can make human worthy of connection but in the end is still untrustworthy and pi must kill or be killed  so what of the strange island in his hallucinating state it serves as a mirage where life is not as sweet as he suspected the island parallels his own problems at sea with rich religious symbolism of the garden of eden no matter what ones ethical code the will to survive trumps ones moral haven these vegetarians person and island dont want to harm but are killing to survive something happened out at sea that his waning mind and blindness both real and spiritual could not substantiate and like all else he twisted it to a socially accepted tale since the island is discovered just after the sailor dies maybe finding one of the chefs tooth on board turned him or maybe pi happened upon a pile of garbage infested with rats and this boy starving and demented enough to have tried his own waste sees it as a heaven his civilized nature knew he should scorn the filth but his barbaric needs were grateful for the nasty feast the bones in the boat proof that his experience was real could have been rat bones  whatever the cause of his epiphany he had to enter the depths of his own personal hell to realize this was not a heaven or garden of eden and a return to civilized behavior was vital for his own survival richard parker was winning as he felt completely detached from civilization he almost wished to stay and die at sea to live at a level of base survival instead of have to emotionally deal with his ordeal to progress but his innate need to survive wins out as he realizes that as the lone castaway if he does not fight his minds descent into madness the sea will eat him mentally and literally  one of my favorite interpretations of the island is a religious fork in the road whatever truly happened the island cements your belief in the first or second account either you see the meerkat remains as proof that the beauty of the first story is true or the island is the point at which you start questioning the credence of his tale and believe he threw in this unbelievable turn of events to ready you to accept his alternate ending as readers we are given the choice between two stories we can pick the miraculous version of the first story an icon of those who believe in god or we can pick the grim atheist view of the pessimisticalthough reasonablesecond story as do those who believe science disproofs god in section one pi references religion to not only show where his beliefs give him strength but to give backbone to the religious allegory he shows disdain for the indecisive agnostic see quotes below and bids you chose your path the island serves to question your own religious devotion but you have to pick what you think it represents which story you care to believe  pi states this is a story that makes you believe in god as a believer in god and the second story i dont think there is merely an atheist interpretation to the second either you accept god with a leap of faith despite dissenting controversy or you take the bleak realism and see god saved him from death at sea and even more protected him from mental anguish by healing his soul from the horrors he experienced both stories can justify the belief in god or justify your belief in nothing just as i dont believe people who buy the second story are atheists i do not believe people who chose the first story follow blindly or idiotically its a matter of interpretation the story isnt going to make you believe or disbelieve god anymore than you now do  at first i was annoyed he recanted his story because i wanted to believe his original story it is imaginative and well written and i didnt like being called out for believing fantasy from the fantasy itself but how could i not love an allegorical explanation to a literal story so now i love that he presents both stories the imaginative farfetched one and the plausible horrific one and leaves you the reader to decide which one you want to buy into and let you ponder what it says about you that is the point of the story  some of my favorite quotes from the book life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can it was my luck to have a few good teachers in my youth men and women who came into my dark head and lit a match doubt is useful for a whilebut we must move on to choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation all living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange sometimes inexplicable ways memory is an ocean and he bobs on the surface first wonder goes deepest wonder after that fits in the impression made by the first the main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart richard parker is unforgettable  very rarely does a character stay with you for life but this story is one that i will carry with me  life of pi starts in india with a boy named piscine molitor patel also known by his nickname pi his family historically has operated a zoo but decides to relocate to canada things dont go quite as expected when the ship carrying them to canada sinks  pi spends  days searching for land with a tiger named richard parker  parallels to real life  did you know that jose salvador alvarenga was adrift for  days at sea he went fishing off the coast of mexico on november   after drifting for more than a year he spotted marshall islands and swam to shore  deep questions  there were some really interesting questions that are raised in the life of pi  what gets you up in the morning what wakes you up out of your bed and inspires you to put one foot in front of the other to make this existence meaningful and worthwhile what is your tiger  why are the stories that we tell ourselves important  book versus movie  as someone who has both read the book and viewed the movie i would recommend reading the book before watching the movie however both are excellent and i really enjoyed the vibrant rich colors in the movie  overall an unforgettable book that will always make me think twice before boarding a boat now i just need to find a cat to adopt and name him richard parker i loved this book i watched the film before reading the book and i loved both of them i enjoy short chapters so this was good for me best scene was the  religious men arguing about pis religion found it really smartly done and funny life full of dangers the heroic and exotic adventures are those adventures truly heroic life of pi is about the origin and nature of lying  in a hypocritical society heroic lies are preferable to the bitter truth a romantic and cloudless childhood to me it was paradise on earth i have nothing but the fondest memories of growing up in a zoo i lived the life of a prince what maharajas son had such vast luxuriant grounds to play about what palace had such a menagerie my alarm clock during my childhood was a pride of lions  then one day a hero must embark on the fateful voyage in the near distance i saw trees i did not react i was certain it was an illusion that a few blinks would make disappear the trees remained in fact they grew to be a forest they were part of a lowlying island i pushed myself up i continued to disbelieve my eyes but it was a thrill to be deluded in such a highquality way the trees were beautiful they were like none i had ever seen before they had a pale bark and equally distributed branches that carried an amazing profusion of leaves these leaves were brilliantly green a green so bright and emerald that next to it vegetation during the monsoons was drab olive  one may lie beautifully for hours while it takes just few brief moments to tell the sorrowful truth people often see me walking down the street casually minding my own business and they always stop and ask me yo justin what are you reading these days and im always happy to stop and engage in conversation about what im reading and i share a few thoughts about the book yeah its not bad pretty good so far really enjoying it better than i expected oh man its alright i guess kinda slow i like to keep my comments pretty general in nature also that never actually happens to me or does it  anyway i did tell a few people i was reading life of pi and every single one of them said oh yeah isnt that the book about the guy and a tiger on a raft because thats what everyone thinks of when they think of life of pi the book about some guy on a boat with a tiger and they are absolutely right i mean if you needed a one sentence synopsis of life of pi you would say its about some dude floating around on a raft or a boat or something with a tiger and that would be it you nailed it  except pi isnt on a lifeboat with richard parker the tiger until about halfway through the book so that synopsis isnt enough because there is so much more going on in life of pi so much more  so lets start with the biggest reason this book gets a coveted five star rating from me i got to learn all about zoos and the animals that inhabit them im kidding a little kind of but the beginning of the book is just fascinating to read pi weaves in stories of his childhood with facts about india religion animals zoos family and all kinds of other stuff one scene in particular that i loved was when pi was trying to determine his religion and the choice that follows just humorous insightful stuff all around and i forgot all about what the book is really about i wont remind you  the story moves from all of that stuff like a memoir i guess to an adventure story now im not a huge adventure story kind of guy but the writing was so engaging and the audiobook narration was so intoxicating that i kept plugging along with all the craziness pi finds himself in it gets pretty violent and a little disgusting at times but youre reading about wild animals and about a guy who is caught in a horrible tale of survival its not too bad  then the end of the book comes along and oh my god i cant even tell you about the end of the book its awesome though just trust me on this one if you havent read it already youve probably read it already youve probably seen the movie too you awesome person you look at you go all awesome and stuff  im gonna watch the movie as soon as possible looking forward to it this was a fantastic audiobook that i spent almost a month listening to during my morning commute whatever i pop in next has a tough act to follow  january has been a pretty solid month of reading for me definitely ended it on a high note i dont rate books five stars very often because im am overly critical book critic but this is a five star read that deserves a little bit of your time this is not a story of a boy and his bff tiger this is nothing like calvin and hobbes the tiger is nothing like tigger or lassie this is not a ya book  that is worth pointing out i think because the movie poster and trailer gave me this impression  this book has teeth  my initial thoughts on life of pi is that it is a book that demands to be read slowly due to a rambling nonlinear narrative in the first few chapters actually it is not it can be read fairly quickly once you hit your stride with it any way the novel got off to a slow start for me though i found the intro authors notes immediately appealing initially i was also a bit confused about which part is narrated by the author and which by piscine pi molitor patel the books protagonist that sorts itself out after a while as i settled into the authors narrative style and the books structure there are some expositions about about running a zoo and animal psychology which i find very interesting i certainly know some people who believe zoos are immoral and all the caged animals should be set free this book presents a plausible case for why this may not be such a good idea and that the animals are unlikely to be grateful to the liberators i am not normally a fan of infodumps but these expositions are affably written and mostly nontechnical  once the main part of the story begins where poor pi is cast away on a life boat with some wild animals the books becomes very engaging and i was devouring his adventure and could not wait to find out what happen next the ocean adventure part of the book is really a riveting read as pi settles into his life on the life boat the book becomes trippy and metaphysical in parts if you read online discussions about this book you will find several interpretation of what it all means and what really transpires in the book to go into too much detail about this ambiguous aspect of the book would risk spoiling the book for potential readers suffice to say that the book left me with plenty of food for thought which is still swirling in my head as i write  art by neanderthaljam  there are elements of humour scattered throughout the book the style of humor tend to be fairly subtle my favorite humorous scene involves three bickering wise men and a boy of multiple faiths i also love how the major supporting character richard parker came by his name my favorite aspect of the book is the prose style which is lyrical accessible and generally very pleasant to read here is one of my favorite passages i will not die i refuse it i will make it through this nightmare i will beat the odds as great as they are i have survived so far miraculously now i will turn miracle into routine the amazing will be seen every day i will put in all the hard work necessary yes so long as god is with me i will not die amen even if you are entirely irreligious you can still appreciate the eloquence of the writing  this book is often classified as a fantasy but i wonder if it is actually more scifi some strange places and things are rationalized with scientific assumptions particularly a mysterious island that appears in the last section of the book some people are understandably frustrated and annoyed by the epilogue of the book where everything seems to turn upside down or not depending on how you want to interpret this part of the book it surprised the hell out of me but adds to the enjoyment of the book and i dont think it invalidates anything that goes on in the preceding chapters looking at other goodreads reviews life of pi seems to be divisive among its readers quite a few people find the book pretentious and not as intelligent or profound as the author presents it to be they may be on to something i dont really know oftentimes i find the reviewers just as pretentious as the book they are criticizing is this a case of an eye for an eye personally i just wanted it to be entertaining and interesting and it meets these criteria in spades a little pretentiousness does not bother me as long as the book is a good read  i have no qualms at all about recommending this book may be you will love it like i do may be it will make you mad and you will throw it at the wall i really dont know how it will be for you totally worth a shot in my opinion the world isnt just the way it is it is how we understand it no and in understanding something we bring something to it no doesnt that make life a story   life is a story and the story of pi patel is one of the most extraordinary stories that i have read in awhile the story begins before the fateful shipwreck that makes up most of the novel pi is a little boy who lives in india on a zoo that his father owns pretty much the greatest place to live as a kid is on a zoo after watching we bought a zoo and reading this book i really want to live on a zoo even though i would have a very hard time not petting the animals the talk that the father gives pi and his brother ravi is one i would also need cause i mean tigers are just so cute    but also deadly    that leads to this remarkable story of how a boy manages to survive not only a shipwreck but also being in a lifeboat with a huge bengal tiger and several other animals but before that all happens i found the beginning of the book quite interesting i didnt realize that this book dealt mainly with the theme of faith and belief while pi is growing up he explores different forms of faith and instead of picking one decides to be catholic islamic and hindu all at the same time being catholic i found the scene of him first talking to the priest really mind opening in a way pi questions a lot about the religion at first having a hard time imagining and having grown up catholic i never asked those questions myself but when he asked them i found myself thinking you know now that i think about it some of this doesnt make sense but thats the point of faith i guess it doesnt all have to make sense  with all the changes occurring in india pi and his family choose to move to canada and take most of the animals from the zoo with them to sell to zoos mostly in america on the way the boat sinks and pi is left alone in a lifeboat with a tiger hyena zebra and orangutan  if it wasnt for pis internal conflict especially with how to deal with richard parker this book could have easily gotten very dry and boring as he just continues to float and going through a very repetitive day yet never once did this book get boring or even repetitive while on the boat pi has to come to face his fate death by water or death by tiger and also his faith but even when things seemed the grimmest pi never stopped fighting for his life  you might think i lost all hope at that point i did and as a result i perked up and felt much better   this book was very beautifully written and moving you really connect with pi and hurt with him and love with him you love the tiger that at any moment could kill pi but i really believe what pi says that without the tiger he would have died richard parker gave him a reason to live without him richard would die and if richard died he would forever be alone the parting of pi and richard was pretty much heart wrenching even though it was probably for the best  dare i say i miss him i do i miss him i still see him in my dreams they are nightmares mostly but nightmares tinged with love such is the strangeness of the human heart   my favorite line of the entire book for many reasons  ultimately this book is about faith and at the end about taking a leap of faith after reading the whole book the last few chapters almost tore me apart i dont want to give away what happens but it just makes your heart fall it ends with a big question mark and it is up for you to decide think oneway and the story changes for you and it isnt at all what you thought it was i decided to take a leap of faith and believe even when it seems impossible and i think that is truly what this book is about and what you take out of it is for you yourself to decide just like faith it cant decide for you will you question and leave faith behind or let it lead you when all seems to change  if you stumble about believability what are you living for love is hard to believe ask any lover life is hard to believe ask any scientist god is hard to believe ask any believer what is your problem with hard to believe   i really loved this book even though the end proved to be a challenge i would recommend it to everyone it really is a quick read and will soon be a movie that i am very excited to see a friend in canada sent a hardback version of this book to me in  i started reading it after about  pages i skipped ahead a few pages a chapter a bit here and there then put it down i thought it was going to move slowly and seemeda little too heavy post  in fall of  i was leaving for a long trip through mexico when i decided to pick up a few books to take with me i saw the paperback and felt like the book was familiar and bought it and a couple others i started to read this book while traveling but in the heat and the dust i was too thirsty and hot to read about a character who was thirsy and hot and stuffed it in my backpack and quickly began reading what i brought with me i finished all of the books i brought and gave them away in exchange for novels and poetry in spanish i read those books translating wiht my dictionary and asking my then partner to read to me what i could translate we finished those too i was about to start don quixote in spanish after visiting the don quiote iconographic museum in guanajuato when my partner told me if i started that one he wouldnt help me read it while we were traveling i put it away and was left with only yann martels life of pi after spending the day and evening out and coming back to our room in the wee hours to make love then relax i couldnt sleep my partner snored a singer in the club across from our hotel in the town center was singing loudly through the night i enjoyed listening to the people outside i picked up life of pi and began when my partner awoke i didnt want to stop but we had a full itinerary and i would get to read again until we left for the next city as boarded our bus though i cracked that book open and read until we arrived in the city fey was ill from drinking the water while he slept i lay on the bed next to him reading outloud i finished the book over night i couldnt stop thinking about it to this day fey still swears we saw a senegal tiger while we were traveling it must have escaped from a zoo it was there we fed it dont you remember of course i do the tiger ate you what oh shut up i know we saw it he wanted to check the newspapers to find out if a tiger were loose i cant explain what exactly changed but after a certain point in the book the boy the tiger  i just wanted to know them a little longer a young man a lifeboat and a bengal tiger named richard parker read the book before seeing the movie as splendid as the cinematography is the images and themes the novel conjures are richer still ridiculous but i just finished reading this for the third timeand was excited to be doing so my kids book club picked this for their may meeting and the parents are reading it as well going to do a dinnerdiscussion then screen the movie in d  there shall be pizza pi and apple pi served  i cannot imagine there are very many readers out there who have not sunk their teeth into life of pi but perhaps having viewed the movie at some point there are those that think theyve already consumed the whole tale no  not so  while the movie version was absolutely excellent the allegory about life itself cant be condensed like a can of soup do viewers consider the why behind pis name pi is infinite with no beginning or end we hear about alpha and omega in training animals but if the boy  in order to survive  has a tiger within him he is both the story is life of pi not the life of pi because it is all our story if we let it be  if all religious dogma has at heart only the concept of love then taking a leap of faith makes no difference with religious preference when pi a vegetarian since birth has become animalistic in tearing apart live turtles and fish when he is at the end of his life or so he believes he faces his sins and turns away from them the frenchman who has killed a woman and a man but who is later killed by richard parker  in order to save pi  is merely pis hallucinatory facing of a memory it is his confession before dyinguntil the carnivorous island miraculously appears  the island full of sustenance but with no solid roots symbolizes food and luxury and slothfulness  the things that can make one feel full and satedbut will kill your soul in the end when pi cleans the lifeboat he removes a human skeleton as well as animal who did the killing is pi also richard parker or did the tiger really kill another castaway in a boat such fantastic allegory  i realize that the original concept of a boy stuck on a life raft came from an earlier work by a brazilian author if i were to write a book about a rooster sitting atop the back of a cat resting upon a dog who is riding a donkey it would not imply theft martel reveals himself in pi and he is no thief in my opinion  i am thrilled to be able to share this book with my teenaged child his friends and their parents this is the story of life and love id been planning to read life of pi for a few years now but never got around to it i had this impr
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,i have a lovehate relationship with this book the writing and imagery are superb and i always love a down with tyrannical overloads generic living and medicalization moral but its other lesson leaves me cringing in the basic knowledge i have of ken kesey the book ultimately seems very misogynistic and antifeminist im all for a gender balance but this book botches up the entire process in a method that purposely lacks tongueincheek flair  basically the plot seems to involve men mentally castrated by a domineering woman who could just as easily be labeled bitch as she could big nurse enter main characterwho in my tattered yellowpaged s copy directly labels him as the hero of the book on the back covera man that pretty much shakes the men up to the supposed feminization of american culture and how its destroying their identities as males read here a huge characterization of the male ego is to dominate the female with opposites all around  how is this man so easily labeled a hero have we forgotten he has been charged and convicted among other things with rape of a female minor and the main reason hes in the asylum is to skimp out on his prison sentence how is that masculine if i am to continue on with the stereotypes the book itself perpetuatesand yet backpedals when necessary why do we consider him the main character when the story is being told in the first person by a native american can you not be a mana herounless youre white or perhaps it was because he was so docile  in the end the supposed hero of the book teaches men that to cast off impending feminization one must be violent towards women muscle them out of the way destroy them if theyre relentless if you are unable or fearful of doing so youre better off killing yourself than being only half of a man oh but wait theres a special lesson for the ladies themselves too to steer clear of the eventual rape assault murder or tortureand yes it will happensimply sexualize yourself thats the only way to be safe andisnt it convenientsecurely a woman so much for individualization and going against cultural norms gentlemen youre a dime a dozen  before we glorify such a book we have to sit down and figure out what exactly masculinity is outside of a cultural setting before we can complain that culture itself is taking it away are we to allow a cowardly violent lookingoutfornumberone individual give us this definition fair and balanced  its one thing for him to say it its another for us to listen quick quick ask me to say in a word how i feel about this book its ok is my reply i persist in following the gr rating system a book that is ok gets two stars two stars does not mean i dislike it i find it necessary to repeat this over and over again  i totally struggled through the first half of the book i found the events the language the characters extremely offputting i tried to feel empathy rather than disgust but i failed also i did not know whom or what to believe what characters say is not necessarily true i was confused and repulsed then somewhere at about the two thirds mark there is a fishing trip everything flipped all of a sudden we see kindness and happiness and joy in life real laughter not fake laughter as before the difference was shockingly dramatic i needed this happiness so i sucked it up at the same time my head was screaming at me this is cinematic this is fake this is overdone i do not like books that are cinematic but i did need the happy sweet and brave to counter the crude horrible grisly and disgusting that the book began with  then we get to the end everything is tied up in a jiffy a rapid succession of events concludes the tale a little bit of reality is clamped on top but not too much to squash out the feelgood feeling and a sense of satisfaction that something had improved  the above describes my emotional journey through this book  i am reacting to the book and i have not seen the movie if i have it is long gone and forgotten it annoys me when people insist on blending the two they are two separate things  the story is told by a socalled deaf and dumb patient the towering halfnative american chief bromden an inmate at a mental asylum in oregon usa in the early s the book was intended to be a criticism of mental care facilities and the practices of those times and rightly so the author did a huge amount of research and had worked at the menlo park veterans hospital as a night aid before writing this book  two other central protagonists fill the screen the first is the loud brash rebellious lifeloving randle mcmurphy formerly imprisoned for battery and gambling in a prison work farm he has had himself transferred to this psychiatric hospital seeking a cushier means of working off his sentence the second protagonist is the hospitals demonic powercrazed head nurse nurse ratched referred to simply as big nurse by the inmates all the orderlies the other nurses and doctors are in reality subservient to her  a number of other patients fill out the register they add color to the story one stutters one is the swedish germophobic cleanfreak one has to say everything in big words this guy is called hardy do you get the connection two prostitutes are thrown in for good measure remember the fishing excursion i spoke of the ease with which inmates exit and the girls enter the institution turn the tale into a swashbuckling adventure tale more fantastical then real the central theme is what happens when the rebellious upstart mcmurphy enters the scene disturbs hospital equilibrium throws all off balance and confronts big nurses iron fisted grip on power we observe how mcmurphys magnetism influences the other inmates  the book is very much a book of its time sexism misogyny and racism abound all of this put together is hard to take hospital orderlies are repeatedly and always referred to only as the black boys mcmurphy comes in as a whirlwind his language is filthy and crude his presence engulfs not only the hospital but also the language of the story it takes a while to see his good points  there are two kinds of patients at the hospital those that are committed and those that may leave if they so wish assuming big nurse consents some havent the courage to face the outside world and have put themselves there of their own freewill remember mcmurphy chose this over the prison work camp bromdens lack of sanity and his inability to hear or speak may be questioned this widens the scope of the novel to include a discussion of how sanity is to be defined but at the same time it lessens the criticism of how mental institutions were being run if people put themselves there how bad were they  the value of laughter is emphasized in the book i like this a quote from the book follows you cannot be strong until you see the funny side of things  another important theme is personal motivation is mcmurphy motivated by financial gain or is he motivated by the friendship that grows between him and other inmates sure sometimes the two may overlap but how do you behave when they dont do you have the courage to help another when it is to your own disadvantage and harm  i favor individualism over unquestioning acceptance of authority i am critical of the authoritarian unnuanced management of psychiatric institutions devoid of compassionate care however i do not feel compelled to give this book or any other book with an important message a high rating to me how a message is conveyed is equally important i find the presentation here to be simplistic and cinematic in tone parts are pure slapstick  the unabridged audiobook is read by john c reilly be careful abridged versions read by other narrators are out on the market reillys performance is very good he does dramatize but he does it exceptionally well when sorensen the swede gets talking i simply had to smile even though he does sound more like a norwegian his personification of mcmurphy will carry you away bromdens docility and personal growth is heard four stars to the narration get ready for a possible unpopular opinion in the ranks  this book was terribly underwhelming and it made me quite angry there are so many aspects that are entirely unappealing to me and im giving myself a swift pat on the back for pushing through finishing it  the fact of the book being set in a mental institution really attracted me to purchasing it that along with it being a so called classic i thought it could do no wrong  now before i completely go off ranting i will say that i did notice there were a couple of messages hidden in the depths of this book and kind of what the author was trying to convey there were some colourful characters some i could go as far as saying were interesting but thats it thats as much praise as i can give  this book was totally swallowed by the constant misogyny spat by the males that thought that if a woman isnt giving sex on a plate shes not worth the time of day im sure ive said this so many times and its tiring sexism was laid on thick kind of like too much icing on a birthday cake and to be honest it was irritating to read  there was too much mentioned about the female boss was described as having oversized breasts who had to constantly listen to their sexist attitudes day in day out it was ultimately depressing and certainly no fun to read about why is a womans worth based on whether she gives it out or not  this was a pointless read that centred around men demoralising women no not for me this strikes me as so overrated and disappointingly juvenile in its fundamental point of view  they are out to get you everyone in concert just to spoil your good time ballcutters are bad hookers who fly their breasts free on a fishing boat are good real men know the difference  none of these characters seem real and the concerns of the novel  freedom social limits the individual and the machine  are presented so stupidly in such a high schoolish manner that its hard to take it seriously there is very little thats human here  the prose here  as in keseys other overrated novel sometimes a great notion  manages to veer from muscular and moving to overwrought and ridiculous sometimes in the same paragraph  its unsurprising that this book would be popular with high school and college students whats baffling to me is that its held in higher regard by others taught as a modern classic etc when people find out i have degrees in psychology they tend to make a few assumptions first they ask me if im psychoanalyzing them which im not not only because psychoanalysis is pseudoscience only english majors love freud for reasons im sure freud would trace back to genitals their own or someone elses but also because im generally more interested in my own cleverness than other peoples problems second they figure ive been trained as a clinician as if i have a secret life as a therapist that no one knows about i dont finally they ask me about books theyve read that theyre sure ive read usually theyre just interested in selfhelp drivel but sometimes they want to talk about this book  which is interesting because this is not a book about psychology in the same way that animal farm is not a book about agriculture this is a novel by ken kesey who went to graduate school for creative writing and also did a lot of drugs he spent a fair amount of time hanging out on a bus with neal cassady the grateful dead and the rest of the merry pranksters dosing the communal koolaid bowl with lsd one flew over the cuckoos nest is not supposed to be a realistic book about mental institutions thank goodness because the treatment people are getting in this book is completely unethical  so whats it about the man man the man is always trying to put you down tell you how to be and you just listen to the man man because the man just has you in his grip and youve got to question this stuff throw off the shackles of the society into which youve been inculcated and expand your mind man  note kesey seems to think you should really only question the things about the world that make it less fun and stuff minorities are for stereotyping and women are for reminding you how emasculated youve become andor fucking you when i say you im assuming you are a white heterosexual male because you dont even have to take drugs to realize that no one else really matters never mind the fact that the book is ostensibly written by a native american because that dude has no real voice and whatever hes halfwhite so its okay if we half care about him  of course the sexism is problematic were not supposed to mind that the hero has raped a woman and were supposed to cheer when the powerful women get put in their place but my major issue with the book is the portrayal of mental health treatment as being mostly useless yes things were not so great in the s yes shock therapy was terrifying and yes lobotomies were horrendous however mental illness isnt something you can just rebel your way out of thats a bit like praying away cancer mental illness is already underdiagnosed and this is another cultural artifact that suggests that people should be wary of treatment  anyway i thought this book was vaguely interesting but mostly juvenile and lacking in nuance im finding myself having a hard time reading topical books from midcentury us writers which is perhaps another indication that my generation inhabits a completely different world and not to seem like an ingrate but i just cant relate i dont have a strong rebellious streak and i dont possess an irrational fear of communists and even though i know that big brother really could pay attention to anything i do i also realize my group texts about where we should go for a beer after work are probably not getting much airtime at the nsa maybe this is the way my kids will feel when they go back and read books about student loan debt denial of climate change and inane iphone apps i hope so  then again maybe this book truly has little substance and maybe it will recede into the bowels of history maybe we should think of this book as evidence that drugs can make you paranoid enough to solipsistically conclude that everything is just a big conspiracy theory and youre the only one who can figure out the charade that my friends is actually an empirical question please someone pass the koolaid i know many people absolutely love this book i have no intention to piss any of you off but man this was the slowest book ive ever read nearly every single page was torture for me to get through im a pretty quick reader but the lack of charpter format made this book wayyyy longer than it appears  most of the characters were pretty flat all these words all these pages and we barely get to know anyone even the narrator so much could have been done there but nope so disappointing  the only thing that got me to give it  stars was the end i must admit i didnt see it coming and it was the perfect ending very dark on second thought i think i mightve been thinking about this book for a good month or so you see even though im changing the score i stand by what i said it is indeed very wellwritten and this is exactly why you dont notice all those problematic issues lying there inbetween the pretty words sexism and racism are so cleverly embedded into the flesh of this story that you pass them by without the slightest hint of what is actually being implied to have the talent to write what you have to say in such an implicit manner and yet what you have to say is pure sexist and racist crap such a fucking waste file this under everyone loved it but me and unpopular opinion    i really didnt like this book ive wanted to read this for years i heard how groundbreakingawesome this book was    i didnt find it that good at all the writing was juvenile he was no george orwell and the characters were racist and sexist    i can see why people like this book and the message of treating the mentally ill better i get that and i think the mentally ill have been treated terribly throughout history i also have a mental illness so that goes without saying  i understand this book was written decades ago but instead of coming off vintage and pulpy to me it was grating to me blah    i wish i never read this book simply because i wanted to enjoy this and i didnt the reputation of this book made me expect it would be a more interesting read i was determined to slog through it but did not find many times when i was glad i was reading it the subject matter is heavy and we are introduced into the mind of one of the inmates of the asylum to see how the ward and the staff look to him it is dark and depressing and its tone reminded me of catch  not sure i even want to try and watch the movie but jack nicholson as mcmurphy intrigues me perhaps watching the story on film will giving me a new appreciation of the book i originally gave this book one star because truthfully i despised it most of it was pure gibberish because it was from the perspective of a schizophrenic but it felt like the author was on drugs when he wrote this yet and i realized this with other novels as well when i have to analyse them for class and read them extremely thoroughly i cant help but gain appreciation for them though im not the biggest fan of the book i still think it was incredibly well written in a way well this book was my twin tbr read with dear sabina remember my last update about the ward being like our society well i take it backit was a ward full of peoole that werent all that seek but stayed cuz of their fear and then one day a martyr shiwed upi was trying to find meaningsomething more than what was therebut in the end i could notit was a very boring and unokeasant read fori was waiting for a big shick at the endingbutthe ending was as biring as the rest if the bookso overall one if s worsr booksbut hey at least i got it out of the way maybe if i were a teenage boy i wouldve been more interested or even impressed by all this misogynistic rebel crap but i am not and the analogy between mcmurphy and jesus are you freaking kidding me ken kesey ugh this book just irks me i dont see what the fuss is all about on this one its aged really badly hard to get past that eh this book didnt age well lots of random racist things lots of weird mental health things the book was okay i liked it more than the movie would i recommend reading it no i dont think so well that was a bizarre walk through a racist misogynistic hellscape masquerading as a progressive book about mental health practices of the late s and early s  no seriously this book was crap the only reason i gave  stars instead of one is that kesey does a good job of painting word pictures in all other respects i think that most reviews of this book completely miss the mark  first up weve got the various racial slurs stereotypes and other general fuckery that was frankly rather painful to read  but then weve got a couple of things that even the blurb gets totally and completely wrong the blurb opens with tyrannical nurse ratched rules her ward in an oregon state mental hospital with a strict and unbending routine strictly speaking yeah nurse ratched does stick to routines but other than that this is completely off base nurse ratched is not some power hungry tyrant except through the eyes of her patients  a group of men who are oh yeah patients in a mental institution  much of the textual evidence for her socalled tyranny are images like her puffing up with rage as she approaches the aides on the ward indeed much of the harshness that we see from nurse ratched is very physical as she grows larger or turns red or whatever  but that fails to acknowledge the fact that the entire story is told through the eyes of a paranoid patient who believes the authority figures and the walls around him are filled with wires and monitoring devices this is the same patient who visits the library and sees the stacks of books teeter above me crazy zigzagging running all different angles to one another one shelf bends a little to the left one to the right some of them are leaning over me and i dont see how the books keep from falling out does this sound like the kind of person who has a great grasp on his physical environment  but many reviews seem to take his descriptions of nurse ratched and her behavior at face value  despite the glaring fact that chief bromden is a textbook unreliable narrator  if you look at the words nurse ratched actually says it is not hard to read her as a woman who is just doing her job you know like a professional  a brief aside dont get me wrong est and lobotomies are horrible and im not giving nurse ratched a pass for using those methods despite the fact that these practices were still in common use in the time she is operating but perhaps just perhaps by trying to maintain order she was actually taking the time to think about the other  men in her ward rather than the one overgrown man child who is the socalled hero of the book  and here we come to the misogyny in the book these men the  or so men that we interact with over the course of the book are so incredibly uncomfortable with a woman being in charge or even holding some kind of position of authority that they feel the need to villainize her and turn their situation into some epic battle of good vs evil that theyre willing to turn a man who is a known criminal con man and rapist and turn him into their hero in the fight for good  hell the blurb even describes him as the swaggering funloving trickster with a devilish grin seriously what the actual fuck how are we able to in the modern day excuse the behavior of this criminal us just oh hes just a fun loving trickster lol im sure the fact that hes white and male doesnt hurt  this book was hard to read not because it was poorly written or anything like that but because it was so blissfully unaware of the fact that its not some struggle between the forces of freedom and the forces of authority it is instead a man child who everyone excuses repeatedly lying and behaving recklessly eventually resulting in the death of another patient the rape of a woman and a murder  the truly painful part of reading this book is not that everyone in the novel is heroworshipping mcmurphy its that in almost every review of the book ive read everyone outside the novel is worshipping him too i really wish i would have read this before seeing the movie because i couldnt stop comparing jack nicholson and louise fletcher to their respective characters who portrayed those roles way better than they were written in this book the movie was pretty true to the book but i have to say i enjoyed the movie more maybe because thats the first time the storyline was presented to me but i think it has more to do with the simplistic plot misogynistic portrayals of every female character seems to be a pattern for kesey and constant racism towards the orderlies i do love nurse ratched though they should put her picture next to villainess in the dictionary this story is so problematic i dont even know where to begin although wellcrafted and thoughtprovoking the story has so much casual racism and misogyny that despite its quality it ends up reading like trash to me  i can handle some outdated comments and viewpoints like in lord of the rings but this novel is racist and antifeminist to the core i mean the protagonists are nearly all white men described indepth and sympathetically while the villains are  checks notes  a busty twodimensional white woman and her three black henchmen depicted as hateful cowardly thieving rapists  oh boy  besides that disturbing dynamic the novel sexualizes almost every female character condones sexual violence against women and celebrates rulebreaking white men who f and fight not unlike donald trump in fact i can totally see why the majority of white baby boomer men voted for trump if this novel represents their zeitgeist nurse ratched and hillary clinton are similar enough especially to anyone who fears the juggernaut of modern matriarchy  weirdly keseys obvious repugnance for powerful women is mixed with attraction topredation on underage girls for example the antihero calls a yearold girl a whore and jokes about raping a yearold girl because apparently she wanted it even his prostitute girlfriend candy didnt look more than sixteen or seventeen yet despite her youth she was somehow okay with being topless on a boat with a bunch of leering older men laughing it off like lol im so sexually traumatized this situation doesnt bother me at all  i kept reading though because i was interested in how the ward and characters change through the course of the novel especially the narrator chief bromden drew my interest despite how stereotypical his character is hes exactly how white people often portray native american men silent serious physically intimidating and defeated by white people  thats in total contrast to books written by native americans like shell shaker kiss of the fur queen or the absolutely true diary of a parttime indian which create resilient characters reject the silentanddefeated stereotype and mix humor alongside grief and horror if kesey were native american instead of white im guessing bromden would be the wittiest character on the ward and a violent white man certainly wouldnt be his hero  the novels portrayal of epilepsy was way off too and i write that as someone with epilepsy theres no way an epileptic while having a seizure during sex would say im all right medicate me and turn me loose again huh nope and nope seizures are not a lowkey drivethru experience that inaccuracy is especially harmful because it perpetuates the idea that men have to downplay their medical issues in order to be seen as strong if a guy has a seizure give him a break let him be confused for a while  so while i can appreciate how the story explores freedomentrapment and questions the line between sanity and insanity it also felt like an appalling display of toxic masculinity and racism disguised under a clever challenge to the system i kept thinking of the song threw it on the ground which is incidentally also what id like to do with this novel on political judgments of aesthetic quality im used to the distracting lowlevel white noise of sexism in the work i read i anticipate it and i anticipate from authors i otherwise admirewho are often superb renderers and visionaries of human life  an example when i read milton i focus on god and satan and mentally rank his little lying eve a symbol that happens to talk sometimes rather than a character resembling human since that is really the most accurate assessment of her capacities  its not that it doesnt bother me as it stands im in a constant state of wry awe at how such intelligent authors male and female can make such a mess of someones basic personhood its just that my choices are deal with the sexism or discard an otherwise brilliant work and ninetynine percent chance my choice is the latter a good work rewards my graciousness and i am usually satisfied with that choice  however every once in awhile i encounter a book whose vision is too intertwined with sexism racism etc to forgive one flew over the cuckoos nest has such a vision sexism is the heart of the narrative  nurse ratcheds gender is not even remotely incidental she is not blank authoritative bureaucracy her uppity femaleness is genetrix of the authoritarian problem and the fact is her femaleness expresses itself as blank authoritative bureaucracy the fear of the bureaucracy of the likes of devilmaycareerectionprone mcmurphy is the fear of a female who rejects her own submission a submission which is nothing less than the natural sexual and political state of women this equation leads to gasp emasculation  we are living in a matriarchy ken kesey warns us in the s gosh how do we know well some rejects in an insane asylum somewhere dont feel selfactualized  why on earth do you think exposing ratcheds breasts is the key to her undoing thats all mcmurphy did he pulled off her shirt and the big bad was defeated by necessity that is her selfbetraying sexuality  some concessions are made so i suppose you can ignore that and try to look at things purely from some whitewashed perspective of individual vs societal repression or something  i can see why youd like the book kind of there is a bit of nuance the lobotomization of the christ scene for example  no im not being completely sarcastic by the books standards its pretty subtle mcmurphy actually goes through a sacrificial transformation from individualist to egoless blob in the course of his attempts to help his fellow inmates jailbreak their destinies as egoless blobs and its morally ambiguous because mcmurphy actually does help his inmates actualize themselves ironically you have to give up some of your virile manliness to help others become virile and manly whoa dude and its kind of well written sometimes there you go  fyi you can get that individual vs societal repression shit from many much better midcentury novels  in conclusion the villain of this story is named nurse ratched and her positive counterpart is a stripper named candy starr and if you think that this isnt enough reason to hate this pretty stupid book you can kiss my ass kinda got spoilers in here near the end mostly really wish i could just focus on the great parts of this book but the sexism is so damn heavy that it left me all tired and completely distracted from the heart of the story i read this years ago but still every once and a while the particularly awful sexist part at the end of the book gives me a weird chill it feels sort of gross to build a friendship with the main character and then have him do something like that i should have seen the signs of unabashed sexism leading up to it but as i often do in real life i let it slide thinking it was a misunderstanding on my part or some other miscommunication its an old book afterall but nah in the end its an author who made sure every problem was caused by a woman and the solution to that problem is to remind women that they are in the end only women by forcing them to shutup and show their breasts just a super weird direction to take the book imo dnf i tried but just couldnt get into it for love or money wow what an overrated novel this book has some serious problems particularly regarding what i read as a strong misogynistic point of view there is a whole conversation in the book where the patients talk about how men used to control everything and now women think they can do whatever they want there are also only two major female characters a bitch and a whore and they were clearly written like thats all the author thought of women i found myself through many parts of the novel siding with the nurse while she definitely exhibits some controlling and and insidious behaviors shes also just a woman trying to do her job while a total jackass goes out of his way constantly to make it all the more difficult for her i think one of my biggest critiques of keseys portrayal of women is his obsession with boobs representing the woman as a whole he does that with both female characters and its such a bare bones poorly thought out and cringey metaphor that i took a star away just for that the only true saving grace in the book is chief who makes for a really unique and enjoyable narrator however i found it completely illogical that a woman as controlling and observant as the nurse would be fooled into thinking he was deaf for  years no way not a recommendation from me this book had some really good qualities i laughed out loud a number of times at the antics and bromdens recollection of his childhood and his talk about the machine had me shaking my fist for him but i was shocked at how much misogyny runs rampant in the book i really liked harding at first because i liked that he was a more feminine man that wasnt made fun of his femininity but shockingly i find him to be the most sexist of all of them after mcmurphy of course i am too tired right now to go on about mcmurphy but if youve read the book you know exactly what i am talking about  i stopped reading at about page  because i was too upset and disgusted with an otherwise interesting and funny read i know im very close to the ending but i no longer care for any of these characters besides bromden and billy but i know what happens to the latter sad cuz he was pretty cute   because i now see this book as an attack on women and feminism and after hearing what happens at the end im even more convinced of that  and more on the author ill just leave you with a quote from the user els review i always think ken kesey and his peeps were all openminded and shit but the m
"The Handmaid's Tale (The Handmaid's Tale, #1)",heres a story that describes the essentials of what life would be like for women if islamic fundamentalists took over our civilization long robes are mandatory as are some kind of facial covering education is forbidden women exist for the pleasure and procreation of the men who control them in short pretty much like the situation that prevailed under the taliban mark steyn makes a pretty convincing case for that being europes inevitable future but margaret atwood places the action here in north america  im being flippant of course the grim future atwood presents is supposed to be the result of not standing up to the conservatives with their moral majority i see it was published in  during reagans second term and the narrative tells us that the utter collapse of all thats good occurred at about that point  since then unless im living in an alternative universe life has continued along more or less as before this year it looked for a while as if a woman might even become president  so much for atwoods dire predictions of the future  again and again in writing reviews of books i run into this situation in which somebody uses fiction to advance some harebrained political view its getting quite old its even worse when the authors aim is so poor every culture faces threats but the christian right is and always has been pretty far down the list a coworker lent me this one so at least i spent no money on it but i regret the time wasted  as a story the narrative improves somewhat toward the end things build toward a climax theres foreshadowing that something dreadful is about to occur and clues provided lead one to imagine what is likely to happen but then the author just drops the ball when the story ends we dont know for sure if the protagonist was betrayed or rescued im at a loss for understanding why it was handled that way  antiutopian writing is an honorable genre as far as i know however nothing has approached those two classics  and brave new world in this case the comparison is pathetic if you are looking for a science or speculative fiction book that deals with the scary rise of patriarchy the women could fly by megan giddings is a much superior novel to the handmaids tale and actually a feminist book  i find that i strongly dislike offred i cant identify with her i find her empty and vapid it bothers me tremendously that the author steals the narrative of black women who lived under chattel slavery my ancestors and never once in the narrative includes a singular black character or even a historical reference to chattel slavery my ancestors worked  hrs a day  days a week regularly had their children and spouses stolen while being sexually assaulted regularly and horribly for those who are unaware children of ham is the biblical designation that made chattel racebased slavery possible in the land of the free and home of the brave and across white christian europe offred casually mentions when she is watching a news program while waiting on the commander that all the children of ham in gilead have been moved to an area and she guesses its to grow food so a return to chattel slavery for the direct descendants of enslaved west africans offred has no feelings about this it triggers no flashbacks offred quickly returns to worrying about herself and those who look like her her mom is clearly a white feminist and thats not really a reference to her race white feminism is feminism for white supremacists traditionally feminism firstsecondthirdcurrent anything that fails to operate from an intersectional basis offers white women opportunities by replacing their labor in the home with underpaid black and brown marginalized genders labor white men dont do more around the house the family simply oppresses by under paying black and brown folks all while pretending that progress for white women at the expense of all other marginalized genders is an advantage to all women white women arent the norm or standard they arent reflective of society at large their experiences are specific to white women so i find this narrative grating white women oppress and so their oppression can only be sympathetic if they remove all other oppression they engage in so they can be the victim then and only then is it a horror why not explore when this really happened in history and deal with the gleeful participation of white women why create a whole new dystopian to explore what still exists in society today shit a republican senator in the gop just got arrested in  for running a baby mill with woc literally holding these women in chattel slavery to steal and sell their babies this happened to kids in vietnam and children are regularly being stolen from loving parents in various african nations and being put up for adoption as if they were orphans surely this was happening when the book was written so why not explore the current realities of real women who were already living a version of this nightmare because its only sympathetic and a horror or a statement if the victims are white even if the narrative is stolen from woc even if all of those real life lived experiences have to be silenced so white women can be victims and not perpetrator or collaborators as shit is happening politically liberals continually harp about real life handmaids tale as if that wasnt always real life for oppressed women of color since columbus got lost on his way to steal from india this is clearly why offred doesnt have any response whatsoever to black folks being reenslaved in the country where we have been oppressed since its founding if her mother had been a true feminist offred wouldve been familiar with black feminists like angela davis audre lorde shirley chisholm ella baker etc shed have been familiar with the combahee river collective had her mother been more of a true feminist maybe offred wouldnt have been so vapid and ridiculous  at one point offred even references that other oppressed groups have survived even though the oppression has stolen whole livesgenerations and still no mention of chattel slavery its frustrating it reveals the authors own racism this story is a horror and a cautionary tale only because it is happening to white women no mention of how white women owned human beings how they fully participated on every level of the chattel slave tradejust like men did they raped adults and children of all genders they were especially known for torturing young kids and harming women being abused by their husbandsfathersbrotherssons they sold their own flesh and blood regularly selling enslaved black folks they knew were related to them they split up families i refuse to get roped into caring about a white woman who has zero fucks to give about anyone who isnt white why are white women removed from the actions of white men like they didnt raise the worst of the bunch if they victimize them its a shame but who gives a fuck about bipoc experiences other than to be stolen as fictitious struggles for white women this is a fail on every level sigh offred seems like the kinda white woman who wouldve voted for chump because racism and then be shocked when that shit boomeranged on her i find since  and the nightmare that is chump im a lot less patient with white folks unintended racism read your own fucking history they were her property white women as slave owners in the american south by stephanie e jonesrogers the american slave coast a history of the slavebreeding industry by constance  ned sublette incidents in the life of a slave girl by harriet ann jacobs stamped from the beginning by ibram x kendi  spoilers below from final chapter of book it bothers me that the premise of this story isnt birth rates declining across the population its birthrates falling amongst caucasians that triggers this narrative the idea that the white population is in decline is a major talking point amongst white supremacists and always has been like  in charlottesville why would a feminist have anxieties in common with white supremacy after all white people have forced the decline of my population through means horrifying and foul same to the indigenous peoples of the americas can we address the dismal medical outcomes that black folks across the diaspora are dying from in real time though could we look into the current crisis of missing indigenous peoples of the america especially women likely being trafficked before we worry about the possible fate of the future caucasian birth rates the underground frailroad is insulting as fuck in this white supremacist context how did i not realize before this read the population decline was limited to white people which isnt a crisis to anyone who isnt a racist  my review from  i recently reread this as im watching the hulu show i read this book almost  years ago i remember seeing the  movie as a kid the book is chilling in our current fascist climate it feels more relevant than when i read it  decades ago this novel closely parallels american slave narratives im especially reminded of harriet jacobs incidents in the life of a slave girl but really most narratives would work the book chronicles the rise of a horribly fascist former us gone awry the text is haunting and made more so by the lack of details in the text we never truly learn offreds real name later the post text tells us little is known about offred or who she really was or the other characters who make up her oppressed world only records of the oppressors are left again very much mirroring us chattel slavery the narrative is beautifully handled and very well written so many elements brought so beautifully together i like the book because by bringing racism to the table the picture of fascism is more complete again reflected all around us is the proof racism and fascism are bffs they go everywhere together the show does a good job of visually showing the oppression but completely erases the racism therefore making the fascism confusing i enjoy both and find both extremely relevant to the times in which we live id also recommend octavia butlers parable of the sower and parable of the talents they are also extremely relevant to the times in which we live i absolutely hated this bookeven if i do admit that structurally it holds together even if the lines are clever a book can be well executed but that doesnt necessarily mean you will like it that is exactly what happened here  why this is a dystopian novel but its too exaggerated i agree that similarities can be drawn to trends in modern society so i was aware of these dangers before reading the book i learned nothing zero  this is a horror novel you better have a strong stomach if you dare to read this atwood will make you squirm maybe you like that i dont  better books are written about feminism about the value of women and what we can and do achieve men are not as evil as they are drawn here  the audiobook narration by claire danes was absolutely perfect she wonderfully expresses emotions her voice quivers from fear its shrill when an aunt screeches absolutely perfect narration if you want to listen to a horror story if i dont like a book absolutely no narrator can make it good  do you hear how upset i am the ending just finished me off i cant think straight  eta the violence at the end of the central story is extreme then a clever long drawn out and may i say boring but also informative academic summary is patched onto the end actually i may have given more stars to the book had it not ended in this way this book cannot but upset a reader maybe that is a sign of a good book it moves youbut that is not enough for me  i might be crazy to write this review either that or for some reason im finding that i no longer get enough hate mail or that my number of friend requests is getting too great  i suppose in every generation there is some work of literature which is highly praised despite its abundant defects simply because the intention of the author is judged so good or the beliefs of the author are too central to how society arranges itself to risk assailing the story with actual criticism my suspicion is that the vast majority of these works are completely erased from history or at least from our consciousness in due time as socially approvable opinions and styles change and things that seemed immediate and important at one time become more distant however i offer up something like the pilgrims progress as an example of one that survived a fairly long time just so one will have an idea of the type  now i have no doubt that such works are honestly enjoyed by many but at least we ought to know why we enjoy them one of the many examples of such moralizing works in our own generation is atwoods the handmaids tale however by way of comparison to bunyans dreary simplistic didactic work with its analogies that dont even work well as a guide for how to react to the things hes warning against atwood doesnt even get points for being bold simplistic dreary and didactic sure but bunyan at least was somewhat sufficiently a blast against conventional ideology that he had to write pilgrims progress from prison atwood gives a paint by numbers rant against everything the present literary establishment is already firmly against if you enjoy atwoods the handmaids tale im ok with that but please enjoy it for what it is and not what it isnt  atwood is infamous for disassociating herself and this work from the category of science fiction she prefers the title of speculative fiction because she says that speculative fiction deals with things that could happen whereas science fiction deals with squids in outer space the pretentiousness of this notwithstanding the truth of the matter is that it is far more likely that there are squids in outer space than anything in this book could happen if at any point your justification for liking a handmaids tale is that it is realistic or prophetic or whatever then you are simply delusional  now lets be clear about what im not saying im not saying that it is impossible that a reactionary religious movement that treated women as second class citizens couldnt come into being and that even within the first world such things are impossible im not saying that there hasnt been oppressive treatment of women in the past i am not even saying that it is impossible for such a thing to happen under the auspices of a christian movement i am saying that the particular delusions that this novel entertains are socially impossible not only in the time frame and time scales that the novel postulates but ever the reality of a reactionary religious movement taking hold and relegating women to second class citizens in a first world nation can be found in for example modern rotherham england however atwood did not predict that and what she did write exists only in her mind and will only exist in her mind ever for all time  religious movements based on a sacred text can have somewhat fluid beliefs but they are not completely plastic predictable social forces work on them within the limits of what they can fit the text to if you want to escape that you have to invent a new text to begin with if a religious movement is reactionary then it tends to want to revert to one of its prior social structures a christian reactionary movement would therefore tend to look back to some earlier social organization earlier theology and earlier language and describe the world in those terms there are plenty of prior social structures and movements to look at  puritans medieval catholic calvinist shakers quakers amish etc further afield atwood could have even mined prior christian heresies or atwood could have set this believably in the far future on some distant planet colonized by a speculative pseudochristian ideology were it could grow unchecked by its surroundings atwoods invented reactionary christian movement however is pretty much entirely invented and novel theologically socially and linguistically so atwoods pseudochristian invented mythos is in fact doctrinally liberal and not reactionary there is absolutely nothing in the text that lets us imagine how this particular set of novel beliefs come about in particular radical departures from conventional belief tend to happen in periods of prosperity and growth radical reactionary movements do tend to happen in the novels predicted times of poverty but again the doctrine of gilead isnt actually a reactionary movement there is nothing at all in the history of christianity that would allow for the basic gender structure that atwood invents there is no past guide to draw on  even worse when a religious movement with a sacred text goes reactionary and populist it inevitably evolves its doctrine to correspond to the simplest and most direct reading of the text  that is to say fundamentalism nuanced readings tend to be thrown out in favor of what is literal and proximal so for example the real american christian right does have novel doctrine based on the book of revelations by applying a more literal reading of the text and assuming its referring to the present or near future but in the case of the christian text while this could produce a society with females in a second class status based on simplistic readings of the text and some fundamentalists in fact do so it could not in fact produce the caste system seen in the novel among other things handmaids are not provided for under new testament theology polygamy is condemned and the simplistic reading of the text gives women the right to be chaste and confers on such high status there have been more  far more  ostensibly christian sects that advocated chastity to the point of human extinction than those that valued women only for their ovaries the sexual mores of the hypothetical society arent a natural expression of the sexual mores of the sacred text no matter how literal you read it but are in fact deeply offensive to all christianity throughout all of its history even the handmaid of title refers to an old testament story which condemns the practice a simplistic reading of a text that condemns abraham and his wifes unfaithfulness in the face of barrenness and sterility cannot possibly be that the text condones such unfaithful acts perhaps if god had endorsed ishmael as the child of the promise you might could read it that way  but only islam actually endorses that reading and only by suggestion that the judeochristian text is perverted from the original  virtually none of the salient features present in the text could possibly be the result of even a twisted evolution of american protestant evangelicalism a society that featured stoning women guilty of adultery or execution of homosexuals i can believe albeit i see absolutely nothing that suggests present trends are going that way and have seen no such trend in my lifetime that a society would be hypocritical in enforcement of its beliefs i can believe but the actual caste system and sexual role that offred is forced to conform to isnt anything you can extract from christianity by even the most tortured route in irony of ironies the actual social construction of gender that atwood imagines finds its closest analogy in the grecoroman world that early christians fought to escape and transform its in that grecoroman model that you find caste systems veils young arranged marriages woman as rewards for martial valor female slaves as sexual objects men living in open marriages while women are executed for adultery state owned prostitutes and high class men seeking out prostitutes because of the loveless arranged marriages that they are entered into provides no social comfort its the grecoroman worldview that puts in tension the practical realities of marriage and erotic desires so that a husband has heirs by one but desires the other the sexual politics of the nonchristian mediterranean world remain largely locked into this paradigm christianity by comparison attempts to resolve this tension with the idea of romantic marital love with all its attendant idealization of finding ones life partner a story that speculated some sort of grecoroman pagan rival might reasonably justify the setting but had christianity been replaced by grecoroman pagans in the story i feel reasonably sure that much less attention would have been paid to it  and the same story with islam as the religion and the uk as the setting would have only been condemned  as an author you know youve done a good job of illustrating someones actual beliefs when they are forced to defend them but no christian not even a young earth creationist longing for a return to th century puritanicalism needs to defend the social structure of atwoods world every christian left right progressive conservative mainstream independent or catholic finds them aberrant the ideal of women under christianity is either of chaste nobility or else of romantic and faithful partnership a handmaids tale chooses to avoid attacking either ideal a fundamentalist reading the work doesnt feel like his beliefs are being mocked a fundamentalist reading the work doesnt feel his opinions are being given short shrift a fundamentalist reading the work isnt compelled to defend the society as reasonable rather a fundamentalist reading the work would come to the opinion that this is the sort of sick sexually perverse pornographic situations that could only come out of the mind of someone bereft of the goodness of christ you might could reasonably attack many of the beliefs of conservative christian evangelicals but in point of fact this book doesnt do so no one actually familiar with the sexual constructs of american evangelicals could possibly believe youd go from present reality the good and bad to arranged marriages to strangers or that the central tenet of protestantism  that a direct relationship with the divine is possible for every person  would be easily subverted its much easier to imagine protestantism with its endless divisions and sects descending to anarchy and mob rule than being unified into a single rigid authoritarian state this is a novel so clearly written by someone on the outside  way on the outside  looking in or rather someone not even looking in and offering the sort of critique an informed observer might have but instead substituting their own insecurity and hatred for reasoned critique  but i guess one should never let reflection get in the way of good visceral emotional fear of the unknown least of all if you are writing a novel  this is no more honest criticism of christianity than the protocols of the elders of zion is honest criticism of jews and it serves the same emotional purpose for its readers  so if we dispose of everything we like about this novel because it attacks the right sort of people or upholds the right conventional ideology what are we to make of it im used to dealing with unflattering presentations of christians and im sometimes capable of overlooking that on some other merit there are plenty of atheists in science fiction and some of them write works i rather enjoy  even with their antichristian moralizing  well to the extent that i could apply the term feminist to a story in a flattering way id like to think that a story deserving of such a label presented women in a flattering way and not in the manner of conventional male chauvinism why it is feminist to present women as wallowing in victimhood and defining themselves by the particular relationships they have with men i confess i dont know im convinced that this novel doesnt capture the reality of womens lives in oppressive patriarchal societies even if atwood had the imagination or experience to write about such things or the courage to write about real problems as they actually are i do know that i have two daughters and i dont want them exposed to this sort of crap until they have firmly in mind a positive mental image of the role of women in the world and the ability to say this is what an author believes im not required to believe it myself fortunately they have their mother for that but literally god help the woman who has to process this sort of swill and bile with no other guide for what it means to be a woman and with the conviction that being a good woman means accepting this work as a guide such a woman may be better off than oppressed woman of atwoods speculative fiction but i guarantee that they will be no happier theyll be too busy oppressing themselves with their fears to actually live life well  its also not that great of a story very little happens characters dont really develop no one is very likeable so the most you can manage for the characters male or female is a sort of mild pity mixed with dislike and nothing is really resolved the only character of the story that is really fully developed is the invented society itself which is at its most basic level just a superficial big brother given a very superficial religious gloss at least orwell had the guts to admit  got it wrong i feel like a teenager again just seeing this book on goodreads i really resented that i had to read this book as a teen to me it was a horrible representation of the victimization and objectification of women its not even a good story give me harper lee edgar allen poe or even shakespeare any day of the week over this one  description  nothing against margaret atwood here just having a book pushed down my throat left a seriously bad taste in my mouth not reading this one ever again but for those who enjoy ma and this type of dystopian society go ahead and dig right in as always happy reading sorry i was so not into this one  i felt manipulated by cheap theatrics also it was not very well written i was looking for something much more profound i dont have much to say beyond this  the premise of this book is completely flawed it supposes that american society will move toward a religiously oppressive governmentrestricting womens rights and sexual freedom between couples to my knowledge there has never been a western civilization which has moved from secular to religious government it is always the other way around it is the nature of societies with a grecoroman pedigree and there is no shred of evidence that america would be any different eastern societies of course are a separate matter  on top of that in atwoods america sex for pleasure is oulawed some religions may preach that sex is just for procreation but to take it to the extreme portrayed in this book goes against human nature  its one thing to paint a bleak and terrifying picture of the future to serve as a clarion call to others but to abandon common sense and human nature in the process makes the entire exercise as demonstrated by the handmaids tale irrelevant uham i living in an alternate universe wtf with this book why do so many people love it im sorry i just dont get it this was my rd and final try with margaret atwood and i will never read anything by her again i find her incredibly insincere and her im subtle and sensitive but really melodramatic style highly perturbing her desperate need to write pretty and her constant use of poetic contradictions into the darkness within or else the light is totally pukey she takes herself so seriously works so hard to be deep its like bad episodes of law and order she is trying to enlighten her reader and i resent her for it pretentious im done did not live up to the hype its no wonder i never really heard about this book until the tv series came out elizabeth moss is a terrific actress this bookmeh slow convoluted writing and not credible plot it seems to be a book written over  years ago which suddenly became relevant in the age of we hate all men the handmaids tale is a book club read of which i had no interest in reading in fact i had to resort to sparknotes to figure out what the heck was going on for example the main character is offred and another is ofwarren the names are bizarre until i read the sparknotes which say that the names of the handmaidens were possessive of their male so fred was the commander in the house that our main character resided hence her name offred  next atwood did a terrible job of explaining the world in which offred found herself due to nuclear war and war damage the birthrate of the country plummeted plus women who did have babies had stillborn or damaged children the birth defect was at a  high a new regime that was male dominated came in force and puritanical beliefs became rampant  atwood does show that for a male dominated society to flourish there needs to be complicity with some females the aunts and the wives were our main complicit females also females needed to comply for the success  when atwood wrote it feminism was at its first wave starting its second reproductive rights have always been fore front of all feminism when reproduction is taken away by physical and ambient forces and reproduction becomes a need for society to flourish fertile women are seen as only walking uteruses by both men and the women of high rank who cannot conceive those women who are unfertile and not of high social rank are banished  some of the themes are interesting but the story is cumbersome to read good literature to me is one that has beautiful prose with interesting themes that is easy to read atwood hits one of the three for me this is going to be a very unpopular opinion but i hated this book i picked up this book because of all the hype with the tv show i really do try to read the book before any tv or movie adaptation because i truly believe that the book is almost always better from what im reading online the tv version of this book veers off and goes further than the book thank goodness now im even more excited to watch the show because this was such a cool idea that was ruined by illogical plot holes incoherent stream of consciousness ramblings and a purposeful lack of detail  here are the things that i liked i liked the premise that the country can be overrun by extreme right wing religious fanatics and essentially returned to puritan times some of the things that were going on in the book really did make me draw parallels with things going on in society today and i can appreciate that this book is a very important piece of feminist literature i like what the author was trying to do and say and i think that this is a book that will resonate with generations of women to come as some of the themes and issues will be around for years to come um  it ends there  i dont use the word hate with a book very often but here its appropriate i know everyone is complaining about the lack of quotation marks and yes that pissed me off too also i had issues with the run on sentences even though i know im guilty of writing run on sentences all the time im not an author so im giving myself a pass here the reasons why i hated this book are threefold the incoherent stream of consciousnessside monologues by the main character purposeful lack of information concerning the nature of the world and the illogical plot holes  i realize that this book is supposed to be a transcription of the main characters audio tape of her story that accounts for several reasons why i dislike this book also as a reader i didnt know that was what was happening until i finished the book and read the authors notes at the end in my opinion that should have been made more clear from the beginning because i would have had a much different outlook on the writing style and i would have been more forgiving about certain things for instance i could not stand the main characters crazy inner thought processesmonologues about basically nothing she would be telling the reader about going to the market and having to keep her head down and then the next paragraph would suddenly shift to her being in a hotel room smoking a cigarette waiting for her future husband and talking about the freaking paintings on the walls this happened all the time there were pages upon pages of this inner monologue about things that happened in the past that had no bearing on the story whatsoever i ended up skimming those parts by the end of the book  also if the main character is telling her story to people who already know what the world is like because they live in it too duh then naturally she would gloss over things but as a reader it was incredibly frustrating to not understand how this world functions i actually noted the page where the author finally told the reader a little bit more of the back store  it was page  out of  page book you literally have to read almost half of the book before you learn anything about how this society functions i was majorly contemplating giving up on this book befo
"Oh, the Places You'll Go!",congratulations  today is your day  youre off to great places  youre off and away  no wonder this was the last tale by dr seuss while he was alive there are two more books published posthumously  and i am sure that he is now visting great places  this is a charming tale about the journey of each of us in our lives but  what i really liked was that dr seuss dont lie to us  he exposes during the rhythmic narrative that not everything will be peachesandicecream in life that well have enjoyable moments in life but  also testing times well have happy events but also sad crisis along the journey not matter if good or bad if we keep walking forward we always will be meeting new places new people new moments  building full and complete lives  what are you still doing here  engage  you have places to go  written for children from age  to  embrace new adventures and changes in your life  you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose   i was not expecting a kids book to be so incredibly profound this picture book follows an unnamed narrator you as they take off on the journey called life this journey takes them through indecision anxiety loneliness and failure but also excitement triumph and happiness  this was a really beautiful story i loved that it wasnt sugarcoating things for kids seuss understood that hard times would happen and he wanted kids to prepare without being scared the end result is perfectly balanced  while i loved it the fouryearold i was reading to also loved it the illustrations rhyming and general excitement keep the story interesting the rhymescheme flowed very well and the wordplay was fun i didnt mind reading this one each time smallfry asked  dr seuss is clearly the true essence of childrens books as he writes about life in a playful and lyrical way that children can easily understand well oh the places youll go is definitely no exception as it is about believing in yourself as you go out into the world oh the places youll go is easily a book that every child should read whenever he or she are in a slump  basically this book is about taking charge of your own life facing difficulties in your life such as loneliness fear and confusion with a straight face and taking on life ahead of you in a lyrical prose that children will easily appreciate  oh my goodness there are so many things that i loved about this book that it would take me all day to list them for one thing dr seuss writing is clearly more memorable in this book as he tells children who are on their way to facing life ahead of them on their own to have positive attitudes and face their fears head on i just loved the way that dr seuss showed the upside and downside attributes of life all in a lyrical prose as the writing was truly creative and inspirational i never would have thought that i would find a book about the tough trials of life that is so wellwritten and whenever i read this book i think about the hardships i had to endure during my life but then i realize that life always has its ups and downs and only you can decide what to make of your life which is what dr seuss has shown in this book probably my favorite verse in this book was this line  im afraid that some times youll play lonely games too games you cant win cause youll play against you  this was a truly powerful verse for me because it is saying that there will be times where you can succeed but sometimes when you do not believe in yourself you end up losing the game or not succeeding at all dr seuss illustrations are just as creative and surreal in this book as the main character is a young boy who wears a yellow jumpsuit and a yellow hat the world that surrounds the boy is extremely surreal as the hills and the grounds are in multicolored stripes and the creatures that the boy meets along the way are also bizarre especially of the image of the boy meeting a huge green monster that has black stripes on its body and short yellow bushy tail  all in all oh the places youll go is easily one of dr seuss best works ever created and it should be read to any child who graduates from school i would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book upon the graduation of my firstborn last weekend i decided to really read this book for the first time i read many dr seuss books to him over the years but somehow this one never made it home with us  what can i say its pretty amazing how deep truths can be conveyed in such simple rhymes seuss warns of setbacks in life the danger of getting stuck in the dreaded waiting place the inevitability of lonely times and the importance of remembering that life is a great balancing act simply brilliant  excerpt  today is your day your mountain is waiting soget on your way one of the most important books i have ever read its so damn inspiring i would like to say its not just for kids like we all love the little prince at different stages of our life this book also serves as an important eye opening one for us when we happen to lack motivation now and then this one will give you different perspectives on life on how to move forward the illustration is so damn amazing i felt like i was flying while reading this book totally one of the best reads you cant go wrong with dr seuss when it comes to kids books they love these books and will want to hear them over and over again this is a childrens story book but reading this feels like dr seuss not only wrote this for young readers he also deliberately target adult readers because the way it gives hope it reminds us of the challenges and the success we might experienced on our journey in our lives a book for children and adults it celebrates and instructs the reader on lifes possible journey as you make your decisions along the way some of your journey will be adventurous and bright while it may also be confusing waiting dark and scary but you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you can steer yourself any direction you choose and in the end kid youll move mountains  this upbeat book about lifes adventures and trials will entertain as well as educate readers the cartoonlike illustrations keep the reader engaged with the texts the rhyming keeps a jingle in the mind of the little characters journey on the pages this book gives hope to the reader about the life decisions they will make along the way great for graduation or when the child is at a turning point in their life highly recommended dr seusss ability of conveying strong important messages in such simple prose is truly astonishing  the book is listed in the ages  section of the  childrens books to read before you growup but seeing so many american reviewers mentioning that they received received it as part of high school graduation shows the practical message of you being in charge of your own fate through choices can appeal to anyone  like all seuss books the illustrations make up so much of the story theres certain paths to avoid and some bumps along the way but with the right attitude and determination your almost guaranteed to succeed well  and  percent guarantee one of my favourite dr seuss books i gave a copy to each one of my children when they graduated from high school ive had this book on my dresser for a long time siting there saying read me but my brain saying but its a kid book like little little kid book dont bother so it sat there in the waiting place just waiting but in reality i was in the waiting place my god ive been in the waiting place what have i been doing all these years waiting just passing time not playing any games to win just waiting how so sad not anymore who needs the gurus preachers god etc when you have this book i got goosebumps reading this book a little little kid book has given me goosebumps pick your head up kid lifes a great balancing act just never forget to be dexterous and deft and never mix up your right foot with your left oh all the places youll shall now go this book contains a very powerful inspirational message for children and adults alike it contains great wisdom about the trials and tribulations of life with a powerful message of life it contains a warning that we all need to heed except when you dont because sometimes you wont something we all have to accept and deal with always at the basis is a very powerful message of hope  kid  youll move mountains unlike solla sollew  dr seuss acknowledges in this book that sometimes when all the options are unattractive we need to head right out of town and how right he is and as in all of dr seuss remarkable books  it is filled with the most beautiful  dreamlike illustrations a must read for every child and adult i bought this for my youngest son who is graduating from high school in a few days  youre off to great places today is your day your mountain is waiting so get on your way  the journey of the book is based on the journey of life with some speed bumps along the way  im sorry to say so but sadly its true that bangups and hangups can happen to you  but it never stops inspiring  and will you succeed yes you will indeed  and  percent guaranteed  and my personal favorite  you have brains in your head you have feet in your shoes you

seusss birthday on march  i read this book to my daughter for bedtime it was her first time it was my th time and i still love it  oh the places youll go is one of those books that everybody gets as a high school graduation present but its a book that can be read and enjoyed at any time it should be noted that this was the last book written and published by dr seuss before his death so the books message takes on a whole new meaning when put into that context  basically this is a story about facing adversity perseverence outofboxthinking and enjoying every moment of life good stuff regardless of politics or religious beliefs stuff you hope your children will read to their children one day im afraid that some times youll play lonely games too games you cant win cause youll play against you all alone whether you like it or not alone will be something youll be quite a lot  i graduated yesterday and i received  copies of this book as gifts i of course had seen this book around a lot but i never actually read it well right now i had the chance to sit down and read through it and maybe im just overtly emotional but i found myself tearing up reading dr seuss words when he wrote this book im sure he had all ages on his mind this book is indeed good for children but i think those who can get the most out of this have to be highschool andor college graduates im happy he wrote this i already read through it twice and im sure ill do it many times over i love this book i mean in general i love dr seuss and all but this one really touched me and its the only one i own of his i bought this and it came just as i had my two lower wisdom teeth removed lets just say there were a few complications and i was stuck in bed for over a week eating baby food and ground up things have you ever had meat ground up in the food processorick and my mom would read things to me and this is one of the things she would read it was so fantasitc it is a very uplifting and positive book it is one of the few things i packed when i moved to nyc a year later and it kept me going when i thought everyone and everything was against me and that i was going to fail at what i was doing turns out i did not fail and i persevered yay dr seuss wow what wonderful stuff a book about life the ups and downs you will experience a warning to not be one of those people who just wait around for life to happen to them dr seuss recommends going out there and grabbing life with both hands and enjoying it no matter what life throws at you a brilliant taster for you  so be sure when you step step with care and great tact and remember that lifes a great balancing act  def a book to give yer kids when they leave home something they can read and have a laugh about and if it turns out their life choices lead to

another chance everyone is just waiting  no thats not for you  somehow youll escape all that waiting and staying youll find the bright places where boom bands are playing this is truly my favorite book but it didnt come so until well after i was a kid when i was around  years old i was sitting in the livingroom doing homework and minding my none business my sister was sitting not too far way reading oh the places youll go to my niece who was  at the time  im not sure why but i started to pay attention to what my sister was reading with each page i found myself identifying with the journey of the main character i understood the circumstances that the main character got himself into and i knew that my niece did not  it was surreal to know that dr seusss words were entertaining my niece and me differently that is when i discovered the genuius of this classic childrens book when were young we hear a kooky story that amuses us when we grow up we see the wisdom behind every line and on every page this transcends age and delivers a story that anyone and everyone can enjoy many highs and lows follow this immersive fantasy tale i loved the way it dealt with the psychology of succeeding and failing and our reactions to both the elephants were a very nice touch  it also took on the very controversial secondperson narrative structure and because of its length neither i nor my daughter had any problems with it  my wife on the other hand hated it thats when i felt the true lows of this immersive fantasy tale and it had nothing to do with the popping of any balloon or being forced to walk it off oh alas the places i have to go kids should never have to sit through an argument at bedtime
Flowers for Algernon,i new after the frist few chapturs that this wood end bad but i kept on reeding cos i thot i mite be rong and it wood end gud but it did end bad and now i aint happy and now i dont like it no more  notty buk made me not happy so i dont give it no more than sum stars   stars  this book had some good messages but wow did parts of it not stand up well to  norms  the good  emphasizing the inherent worth of people deemed less intelligent than others  exploring how intelligence doesnt necessarily coincide with happiness or kindness  exposing how badly those with mental disabilities are treated by others including their own families  the bad  the relationships charlie had with alice versus fay alice is considered the true love interest and she just patiently accepts charlie sleeping with fay because he never told fay about his history i am not sure what message was trying to be conveyed by the author in this situation but it made alice look like a doormat charlie like an asshole and fay like a selfcentered floozy i didnt enjoy this on multiple levels  the use of retard in this book repeatedly it made me cringe every time  the way that every single scientist professor etc were made out to be either dumber than they thought they were were wasting their time on very small advances to science andor lacked humanity in regards to their test subjects in the current climate of lay people acting like they are doing their own research on covid vaccines aka using google to find quack websites that support their own beliefs this really rubbed me the wrong way  i can see why this became a classic but at the same time i dont think i would encourage my own children to read this book in the future if their schools dont have it already in their curriculum mine didnt which is why i am just now reading it  this book had a wonderful premise  charlie gordon a year old mentally retarded man but kind warm and enthusiastic to become smart like his peers is chosen for an experiment to increase his iq  after the experiment was successful on algernon a white lab mouse with a successful operation he starts gaining smartness exponentially and over the course of several months turns into a genius  but at a price  not only does he learn about the bitter truths of living in a cruel world but because he is far ahead in intelligence now than even the scientists who experimented on him he finds himself just as isolated from the rest of humanity as he was when he was retarded the only real bond he has formed right from his naturally retarded state to his genius stage to his eventual decline into his erstwhile state is the little white mouse algernon and yet he manages to find a way for himself  until algernon starts to go downhill again and dies  and now gordon knows he too will follow the same path and he must live as much as he can in the short time he has  however the narrative was cold abrupt and unconvincing most of the time the only time it was convincing was when gordon was retarded struggling first to become smart and at the end to make peace with his declining intelligence  and it was so warm you could not but love the kind man striving to be liked but the narrative loses its magic when gordon is a genius and is struggling to come to terms with his past his relationship with his father and mother his sister and trying to convince alice of his love for her the narrative is so abrupt it fails to make any impact  there are some brilliant observations in between but most of the rest is well melodramatic predictable and unsubtle in tone  something that can be written by anyone whos been explained the story well the cringing part does little to depict the internal struggles gordon faces all in all it is a wonderful work marred by clumsy writing in the middle part  when gordon becomes smart especially when set off against the beautifully effortlessly moving beginning and the end parts  i could relate to his feelings for algernon  it was touching but i wish it had been explored a little more  it was written as a short story first and following its popularity extended into a novel and then into a movie  i only hope the story and the movie are better at convincing their audience a hugo award is understandable it is voted upon by readers  but a nebula it is difficult enough to be accepted and loved for a normal person how much more if youre mentally lacking  sniffing and crying my heart out so heartbreaking and piteous i know charlie wouldnt want me to pity him this is just too much for me although some of the medical terms and scientific jargons were quite laden to process i cant break the fascination i had with this book i knew from the getgo that this is gonna hurt but i never thought i would be affected this much  people who are less advanced in mental or physical capacity should be loved no matter what what they lack mentally we as people who have more grasp of knowledge and understanding should have aplenty  while a clever little book with many great quotable lines however it has a huge slow point that had me putting flowers for algernon down and hoping it would finish itself the first  is a fast paced cant put down read but by the time our lead man has gained a crazy high iq this becomes less interesting maybe its his selfcentered egoism or just that hes boring and almost too intelligent at some point im not totally sure what causes the slow down except to say that its a huge lull in the narrative  a classic i understand why this is an educational standard and deemed a classic by many for having been written in  daniel keyes is clearly a brilliant philosopher and writer the idea is clever the execution is amazing i love the way the spelling grammar etc changes throughout the story and even the delivery of the story via progress reports is inspired there are moments of pure genius in this story and many quotable lines of course on the educational side of things there is the ethical question of if what they did to charlie was morale as well as if it was worth it not just for charlie but for anyone involved in the project without a doubt thousands of different papers and analysis could be done on flowers for algernon i suppose thats why teachers love to keep it on the educational reading list although i do feel bad for any kids dealing with the lull in the story  relevant even today many quotes and thoughts in flowers for algernon are relevant even today in  my two favourite are  as soon as any word begins to mean anything to anyone theyll change it the idea seems to be use an expression as long as it doesnt mean anything to anybody  although we know the end of the maze holds death and it is something i have not always knownnot long ago the adolescent in me thought death could happen only to other people i see now that the path i choose through that maze makes me what i am   for number  we should be over the implied meaning of words by now its crazy to think we keep renaming something with the hope that we can remove the hurt fear or anger that the word invokes renaming something doesnt change what it is for number  it constantly amazes me how few people understand that there is no end goal in this world or life its just existence if you arent living in the here and now then you are probably missing the whole point of why you exist i still have to remind myself of this as our society is very good as pretending this isnt the truth on a daily basis  overall im glad to have read keyes classic novel and ill leave my print copy on my shelf with a couple quotes flagged in it because i think its worthy of a place on the shelf but id be kidding myself if i think ill ever read it again that said i might lend it out to people in the future which is always a good use of a book predictable though interesting  at its core this is a story that highlights the distinction between intelligence and humanity and how tampering with nature can be dangerous well written i had hoped the obvious would be overcome in the plot but was disappointed its simple paced well and engaging though the characters lack depth beyond this theres really not much to say on to the next one i think we all know the story of the gentle and dullwitted charlie gordon who rapidly attains great intelligence thanks to an experimental new surgery his emotional journey is very poignant especially as he finally understands the traumatic events of his youth and explores relationships with his teacher and a freespirited painter the use of his daily journal entries as the narrative structure lets daniel keyes depict his growing intelligence clearly and when the mouse experimental subject algernon who has had the same procedure starts to exhibit erratic behavior and faltering mental faculties well it doesnt take a genius to know what is coming  this book was originally a hugowinning short story and later was expanded into a nebulawinning novel in  and it is a book that many of you were likely assigned in high school it is undeniably wellwritten and emotionally affecting and i think the inevitable ending has the weight of tragedy it also explores a lot of interesting themes like how society treats the mentally disabled as well as how we perceive those of high intelligence and how those people have trouble connecting with normal people his attempts to find romance are also complicated by his rapidly growing intelligence and it is clear that being smarter doesnt mean being happier the professors involved in the experiment are also portrayed well with all the moral complexities their work entails  still i felt that the whole story arc was fairly predictable and that it wasnt really science fiction in feel other than the central conceit its more of a psychological exploration and while i dont have a problem with that i dont need aliens worm holes galactic conflicts all the time really i just didnt feel like the story really pushed any boundaries the way great sf does though i havent read it i imagine this book falls in the same borderline mainstream category as kazuo ishiguros never let me go so it was worth reading and i might have enjoyed it more back in high school but it didnt really wow me and for that matter it feels very much a product of the s and likely wouldnt make much of a splash if published today this book scarred me as a young child cant believe i read this in th grade the trauma  still a beautiful story though after wed been chatting about different books we like a friend of mine kindly sent this to me in the mail as at xmas i felt obliged to send him a book in return since he was interested in pynchon i mailed him the crying of lot  in a package on which i drew little post horns making myself feel very clever  so thats how i came to finally read this which is one of those books like catcher in the rye that i always felt vaguely bad about never having read in grade school since it seemed everyone else had  it was a quick engaging read as charly moves from one exceptional end of the spectrum to the other and then back again the writing style of his progress reports changes  from rudimentary statements lacking punctuation to complex and occasionally lyrical sentences on some level this technique for conveying charlys development felt obvious or trite but i was impressed with how keyes pulled it off  as it dawned on me where it was all heading about a third of the way through i was afraid the narrative would become tedious if keyes tried to conceal the inevitable by dragging the story out in order to set up a big reveal i thought keyes avoided this pitfall instead of trying to maintain an air of suspense to the last possible moment at which point the reader finally learns whether or not charly solves the problem keyes shows us the gradual process by which charly realizes hes going to revert and that theres nothing he can do about it charlys decline is anticipated in advance his steps to cope with this inevitability are a major part of the story i thought this was effective  and i guess if one were to talk about this storys universal appeal as i can imagine one would in a high school lit class it would consist in the fact that like charly every human being develops from a state of vulnerable immaturity to adult autonomy only to decline in the end toward darkness and death such is the human condition sound sufficiently grandiose  i kept wondering what readings of this book from a disability studies lens would say accounting for dated terminology by the simple fact that the book is dated or by the fact that such language realistically conveys people being cruel or insensitive to charly which is a central point of the book and would thus be justified even if written in  keyes nevertheless seems to equate mental disability with dwelling in platos cave or being under kantian heteronomy as charly declines he becomes a cultural philistine the likes of which allan bloom would excoriate for living a meaningless existence pop culture movies what a waste and yet isnt the book fundamentally sympathetic to charly doesnt it inculcate empathy isnt it on his side against the quack medical experts the myopic academics the cruel clod of an everyman with a new york accent this was an interesting novel that discusses themes surrounding intelligence and quality of life given when it was written parts of the messaging was quite dated including the unfortunate use of the rword yet i appreciated that this novel made some important statements surrounding societal prejudice against those deemed of lower intelligence while i struggled with the first half of this novel i thought the ending was quite profound and emotional helping to redeem the story not exactly an improvement over the original  hugo awardwinning short story but more of an expansion of the character of charlie gordon a lowiq man who undergoes experimental surgery to increase his intelligence although the greater length of the novel which won the  nebula award allows for more insight into gordons background as well as his emotional development it often feels padded with pop psychologyhuman potential movement and sexual angst in the spirit of the times during which it was written although its science and story feel dated its a classic of the genre worth reading at least once but many readers may find the original short story preferable i almost suggested this book as a community read for a college then i was thinking waitaminute isnt the lesson of this book that being smarter only makes you less happy because then you realize just how dumb you are isnt it better to go through life a dumdum thats so dumb hes not even aware how dumb he is wouldnt this be the exact wrong book for college students to read one that would suggest they should turn and run as fast as possible lest they get smart and realize how miserable they are  its kind of like you can go see the national in concert and maybe those fans are having a blast but i kinda think theyre having way less fun than the people who are going to see kiss  which isnt to say that kiss fans are dumb its to say that dumb fun is a lot more fun than sophisticated fun pizza is more fun than scallops this sort of thing  also as a note ive seen the national in concert and im here to tell you those fans are not having a blast they are looking all around them to see who is looking at them hand to god standing there it was like when youre on an airplane and a kid is in front of you and keeps looking backwards over the seat im at this concert and every asshole  inches in front of me is turning around looking off this way and that i dont know who these people were looking for but i would think they could easily spot them they were all wearing what looked like expensive eyewear  as another note i had a medium good time but then i also kind of had a fight with my girlfriend at the time i cant remember why but i remember enjoying listening to the national on the way home and enjoying that more because i didnt care about the fight anymore which seems like a profoundly stupid way for the night to go but there you have it more fun to listen to a cd in the car on the way home from a concert because i was at that moment carefree  but maybe when youre really stupid youre not carefree you just care about stupider things  i dont know i dont want to think about it anymore i cant really quantify the worries of someone super stupid or super smart i just know that being somewhere in the middle doesnt seem to lead to a carefree life  also fuck mazes seriously i almost suggested this book as a community read for a college then i was thinking waitaminute isnt the lesson of this book that being smarter only makes you less happy because then you realize just how dumb you are isnt it better to go through life a dumdum thats so dumb hes not even aware how dumb he is wouldnt this be the exact wrong book for college students to read one that would suggest they should turn and run as fast as possible lest they get smart and realize

smart i just know that being somewhere in the middle doesnt seem to lead to a carefree life  also fuck mazes seriously includes some spoilers i cant believe the novel was originally published in the s i think it would still have done well was it published today it reminded me a little bit of the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime probably because we get to see what the narrator feels and how he is ablenot able to express it i thought the author did especially well in showing us what happens when your intellectual growth outstrips your emotional growth he also reminds us of the unreliability of memories  was that really what happened or only our interpretation of what happened this must be so much more confusing when you are another person when remembering somethings than the person experiencing it  and i love that the author makes a point of separating these two charlies ironic though how quickly he starts looking down on other peoples intelligence once he hits genius status one would think that because of his history this would not happen but he never really has time to develop empathy and an in a way i suppose this is his way to get back at everyone for me a very realistic story written in an easyreading epistolary style which made think and feel one of my top  favorite classics  the story charlie gordon  years old suffers from phenylketonuria and has an iq of  he holds a menial job at a bakery wanting to improve himself charlie attends reading and writing classes at the beekman college center for retarded adults two researchers at beekman dr nemur and dr strauss are looking for a human test subject on whom to try a new surgical technique intended to increase intelligence they had already performed the surgery on a mouse named algernon dramatically improving his mental performance based on his teachers recommendation and his motivation to improve charlie is chosen over smarter pupils to undergo the procedure i knew what was going to happen in this novel before i read it i wouldnt say it ruined the experience of watching the story unfold but it did lessen the emotional impact dont get me wrong its still a sad story for different reasons although most people have already read this i still dont want to spoil it for the few who may not have so im not going to say specifically what makes it so sad this is a classic that i think everyone should read it took me awhile after finishing to actually sit down and write my thoughts on this book i purposefully procrastinated writing it i still am trying to hold off as long as possible to write anything that has any relation to the book  see yep  with hesitation i settle on  solid stars let me explain  character   this was the highlight of the story for i believe that was also the authors intent charlie is a fascinating character to follow and i love that the book is written from his perspective to allow a deep dive in what keyes believe to be a psyche of someone who undergone an intellect increasing type of surgery  charlie goes through a very rapid intellectual growth but his emotional intelligence does not quite evolve as rapidly this for me touched on a few societal issues and really made me think about what it means to be smart is it really a good thing id have to say that it appears that the saying too much of a good thing can be bad for you applies to the smarts human are social creatures after all so does being smart above and beyond the average help a person or does it isolate them from the rest of us at what point does the isolation become unbearable  is it possible to grow so smart that a person could feel like they live among a lower order of beings and yet be so emotionally inept that that same person doesnt even know how to act in a social setting  charlie fascinated me as he went through the many stages of his intellectual growth and i really wanted to know at what point would he peak that movie lucy came to mind as i was reading this what would happen if charlie learned to use his brain to  of its capacity even though from a neuroscientist perspective that is a complete fallacy   story   well as it turns out we would never find out as that is not how the story goes no spoilers here but do take a read to see for yourself what happens to charlie  this is a sad story this is an emotionally evocative tale to say the least it is charged with thought provoking narrative a question that stuck to me and i think will continue to stick with me for a long time is when fed up with all the showing off as if he was an experimental mouse hmm he was an experimental mouse he is exasperated that the scientists around him do not seem to comprehend he was a person even before the operation maybe not a self conscious one maybe he wasnt smart enough to be very self aware maybe but he was a person nonetheless  think about that really just sit down and think about that  ill wait  now why only a rating of  you might ask well its because nothing really happens in the story it is very psychologically charged extremely emotional but other then that one plot twist nothing happens  if youre looking for a fast paced read this is by far not it  this is a look in a brain of a person whos going through an unusual circumstances in his life as a short story this would be a clear and undisputed  stars as a novel however it drags in a bit too long but still remains good in quality so  stars seem like a fair rating for this section    setting   now there really is no setting to me in this novel well maybe that is a bit harsh there is a setting but it is so mundane and usual that it blends in with the rest of it all without much notice this thing is happening in nyc yet i do not get a good look into the nyc setting i barely get any look other then a few mentions of a street to give me an idea where charlie is as a nyc local maybe i expected more i dont know but overall the setting was very weak  in all honesty i do not believe it was meant to be strong anyhow keyes focus was elsewhere   in total  solid stars is a fair rating i believe i am recommending that you read this book but i am doing so with caution make sure you are prepared for an emotional roller coaster it will take you through if you are unhappy or depressed do not read thisthis is the type of book that will shave a few levels off your upbeat positive energy anytime you read a few pages  to be fairthat is the truth of our reality and sometimes we need to gather the courage to face it   roman ragnar charlie gordon is  years old and has low intelligence he is offered an operation to make him smart follow charlie through his progress reports to learn how he got on  i was put onto this novel when i read everything everything by nicola yoon she referred to this book time and time again throughout her novel  flowers for algernon is considered by many readers to be a classic and it won the nebula award in   this novel was written in  and the language used reflects the time books today would never dream of using these words about disability but older readers will have used them daily in all innocence  i love first person narratives but i thought this novel got off to a poor start because of the phonetic spelling this was due to charlies low intelligence and he even poked fun at his own ignorance and lack of punctuation then i decided to read it in character like the nutter on the bus and went with the flow following charlies operation he became smart and his writing quality increased to that which you would expect from an award winning book  i did not think the plot was brilliant perhaps enough for a  minute television drama this science fiction was sad in places and it is an emotional read however i do not feel that it deserves all the acclaim many readers have given this book or to win a book award i thought this novel was an okay  star read but certainly not a classic that many readers consider it to be normally i have plenty to say about a book but this was like reading the free metro newspaper for my impressions to be limited to sad in places and it is an emotional read shows that flowers for algernon did not rock my boat  i made highlights on my kindle as usual and here is the very best and most impressive quote i can give you from the whole book  how strange it is that people of honest feelings and sensibility who would not take advantage of a man born without arms or legs or eyes  how such people think nothing of abusing a man born with low intelligence it infuriated me to remember that not too long ago i  like this boy  had foolishly played the clown this book was published in  so many of the attitudes towards people who were different are not common today charlie is a man in his s with cognitive disabilities which were labeled mental retardation in that era modern readers may not realize that at the time he was a child in the s many families perhaps the majority sent their children to state institutions where they stayed often for their entire lives as a college student i worked in the fernald state school in massachusetts which closed in  also i had a friend in high school whose family had institutionalized her brother at an early age the existence of this brother was a secret the family kept from most people  charlie had an iq of around  which in the past was considered the benchmark for an intellectual disability characterized by significant cognitive impairments  his mother was perpetually denying his disability and seeking a cure eventually the family  the two parents and a daughter  broke up due to the parents constant arguments about charlie charlie was sent to an institution at this institution he was selected to be part of an experimental treatment that could increase his intelligence  what makes this science fiction the experiment on charlie focuses on the effect on charlie and everyone around him it raises deep questions about the nature of disability intelligence and social attitudes  while the themes are deep there are many dated aspects to this book it was   stars for me i dont read scifi often but this is a classic that it seemed time to read plus it was an audible daily deal i first read this book in the late sixties when it was relatively fresh and i was a young teenager yes im that old i read it again because i could remember almost nothing of the story my best friend read cowboy paperbacks i was into science fiction but i probably read this one because it was full of sex bordering on porno  you have to remember that in the late sixties there were no such wonders as mobile phones computers and the internet six transistor radios and calculators were the in things both ate batteries like peanuts we had four channels on the huge box of a tv with a twentyinch screen which closed down at bedtime when a friendly lady wished us all a goodnight  and so this book full of sex disguised as science fiction was just the thing for an inquisitive young lad in a world of controlled censorship what do i think today disregarding the sexy bits i thought the first third was fascinating the middle third was tedious and the last third was a predictable disappointment goodnight daniel keyes novella flowers for algernon was published in  and in  was expanded into the novel because of its popularity i read the novel as a teenager in high school and enjoyed it enough to read it several times i also saw the  movie charly based on the book i had not read the book since then  a little sniffing around the net brought the information that keyes was inspired when teaching special needs students and that characters in the novel were based on people he knew  the story is presented through a series of journal entries by charlie who is  mentally impaired and working in a menial job with friends whom he likes although they take advantage of him and make him the brunt of jokes  charlie takes classes and sincerely wants to improve himself to be normal he agrees to become a test subject in hopes of gaining normal intelligence algernon a mouse showed amazing intellectual powers after receiving an operation  as charlies capacity for understanding grows he outpaces everyone around him including the scientists  charlies parents had abandoned him to a home when his mother became concerned that charlie might harm or abuse his little sister he struggles with the demons of his now understood past particularly the mistreatment he suffered from his mother which left him unable to have normal sexual relationships the psychology is very freudian  algernon the mouse shows the effects of the experiment is shortlived and charlie grapples with this knowledge becoming manic in his obsession to find a cure he also tries to reconnect with his family  it seemed to me that the novel was informed by the scifi trope of the highly intelligent scientist who loses his humanity and yet in the real world i can think of a multitude of brilliant people whose compassion and humanity was amplified by their intelligence  i was an arrogant selfcentered bastardincapable of making friends or thinking about other people and their problems charlie  in the end charlies is as isolated as a supergenius as he was with an iq of  he calls for the need to respect all humans regardless of their intelligence  but i know now theres one thing youve all overlooked intelligence and education that hasnt been tempered by human affection isnt worth a damnintelligence is one of the greatest human gifts but all too often a search for knowledge drives out the search for loveintelligence without the ability to give and receive affection leads to mental and moral breakdown to neurosis and possibly even psychosis charlie  my local book club read the novel this month to great acclaim by all everyone thought the epistolary format offered great insight into charlies developing and declining intelligence  one member noted that in a few months charlie went from a childish innocence through all the stages of development before regressing againa coming of age story another mentioned he connected to the book because of a family member and one womans hea
Anna Karenina,this is not a strict book review but rather a metareview of what reading this book led to in my life please avoid reading this if youre looking for an in depth analysis of anna karenina thanks i should also mention that there is a big spoiler in here in case youve remained untouched by cultural osmosis but you should read my review anyway to save yourself the trouble  i grew up believing like most of us that burning books was something nazis did though of course burning disco records at shea stadium was perfectly fine i believed that burning books was only a couple of steps down from burning people in ovens or that it was at least a step towards holocaust  if i heard the words burning books or book burning i saw gestapo ss and sa marching around a mountainous bonfire of books in a menacingly lit square its a scary image an image of censorship of fear mongering of mind control  an image of evil so i never imagined that i would become a book burner  that all changed the day anna karenina that insufferable whiny pathetic pain in the ass finally jumped off the platform and killed herself  that summer i was performing in shakespeare in the mountains and i knew id have plenty of down time so it was a perfect summer to read another  page novel id read count of monte cristo one summer when i was working day camps les miserable one summer when i was working at a residential camp and shogun in one of my final summers of zero responsibility a summer shifting back and forth between marc antony in julius caesar and pinch antonio and the nun which i played with great gusto impersonating terry jones in drag in comedy of errors or sitting at a pub in the mountains while i waited for the matinee to give way to the evening show seemed an ideal time to blaze through a big meaty classic i narrowed the field to two by tolstoy war and peace and anna karenina i chose the latter and was very quickly sorry i did  i have never met such an unlikable bunch of bunsholes in my life mkayi admit iti am applying mr mackeys lesson you should see how much money ive put in the vulgarity jar this past week seriously i loathed them all and couldnt give a damn about their problems by the end of the first part i was longing for anna to kill herself id known the ending since i was a kid and if you didnt and i spoiled it for you sorry but how could you not know before now i wanted horrible things to happen to everyone i wanted vronsky to die when his horse breaks its back i wanted everyone else to die of consumption like nikolai and then i started thinking of how much fun it would be to rewrite this book with a mad stalin cleansing the whole bunch of them and sending them to a gulag in fact this book is the ultimate excuse for the october revolution though i am not comparing stalinism to bolshevism if id lived as a serf amongst this pack of idiots id have supported the bolshies without a second thought  i found the book excruciating but i was locked in my life long need to finish any book i started it was a compulsion i had never been able to break and i had the time for it that summer i spent three months in the presence of powerful andor fun shakespeare plays and contrasted those with a soul suckingly unenjoyable tolstoy novel and then i couldnt escape because of my own head i told myself many things to get through it all i am missing the point somethings missing in translation im in the wrong head space i shouldnt have read it while i was living and breathing shakespeare it will get better  it never did not for me i hated every mkaying page then near the end of the summer while i was sitting in the tent a couple of hours from the matinee i remember it was comedy of errors because i was there early to set up the puppet theatre i finally had the momentary joy of annas suicide ecstasy she was gone and i was almost free but then i wasnt free because i still had the final part of the novel to read and i needed to get ready for the show then after the show i was heading out to claim a campsite for an overnight before coming back for an evening show of caesar i was worried i wouldnt have time to finish that day but i read pages whenever i found a free moment and it was looking good  come twilight i was through with the shows and back at camp with erika and my little cousin shaina the fire was innocently crackling erika was making hot dogs with shaina so i retreated to the tent and pushed through the rest of the book when it was over i emerged full of anger and bile and tossed the book onto the picnic table with disgust i sat in front of the fire eating my hot dogs and drinking beer and thats when the fire stopped being innocent i knew i needed to burn this book  i couldnt do it at first i had to talk myself into it and i dont think i could have done it at all if erika hadnt supported the decision shed lived through all of my complaining though and knew how much i hated the book and i am pretty sure she hated listening to my complaints almost as much so i looked at the book and the fire i ate marshmallows and spewed my disdain i sang beatles songs then went back to my rage and finally i just stood up and said mkay it  i tossed it into the flames and watched that brick of a book slowly twist and char and begin to float into the night sky the fire around the book blazed high for a good ten minutes the first minute of which was colored by the inks of the cover then it tumbled off its prop log and into the heart of the coals disappearing forever i cheered and danced and exorcised that book from my system i felt better i was cleansed of my communion with those whiny russians and i vowed in that moment to never again allow myself to get locked into a book i couldnt stand its still hard but i have put a few aside  since the burning of anna karenina there have been a few books that have followed it into the flames some because i loved them and wanted to give them an appropriate pyre some because i loathed them and wanted to condemn them to the fire i dont see nazis marching around the flames anymore either i see a clear mountain night i taste bad wine and hot dogs i hear wind forty feet up in the tops of the trees i smell the chemical pong of toxic ink and i feel the relief of never having to see anna karenina on my bookshelf again  whew i feel much better now i tried so hard but i give up  each and every tolstoys story on top of making me annoyed and exasperated bores me to tears when i come across critics and reviewers singing praise to him my eyes start to roll involuntarily thats the sort of effect the sound of tolstoys name a casual mention of his work and unlocked memories of reading his biography produce in me tolstoy certainly didnt practice what he preached   its especially disheartening to realize how for some reason he didnt apply his omnipresent concept of universal love that he quite gracelessly shoved down my th readers throats to his own family women and female characters universal love my ass sounds sweeteningly sick like so many other things written by bored aristocrats once you dive deep into his biography my heart goes out to tolstoys amazing precious wonderful wife sophia andreyevna should be no less famous than the man who wouldnt be the tolstoy we know today without her having sacrificed her health her time her emotional and physical resources her whole life at his altar  and when he endeavoured to in his halfhearted attempts to abide by his own behests and show a good example of practice what you preach in order not to appear a hypocritical babbler the results were kind of ridiculous and showed just how farfetched his philosophy was from real life how detached from the realm of russian culture no wonder he had such an epic mental breakdown at the end of his life turns out wearing a peasant shirt doesnt bring you closer to understanding the struggles of ordinary people and eventually being able to associate with them outside the little fantasy bubble you had lived in huh  in my humble opinion tolstoy is the least specifically russian writer theres to find i know most will disagree but calling him national writer is a stretch he was sort of universal which explains his popularity across the world unlike dostoevsky whose work is specifically russian by nature yet so brilliant that its also universal i always look with scepticism at anyone who claims to get  meanings behind his work i want to be you so bad but when a person with no exposure to russian culture whatsoever claims to be able to grasp dostoevskys ideas emerged straight from the depths of hell russian culture and mentality i digress theyd be unlucky to accomplish basic comprehension lmao  sure enough tolstoys ideas and personality were shaped by sociocultural ambiance of the th century russia that being said i find that his work is the least reflective of russian culture compared to other russian writers  lets just briefly mention that popular culture and elite culture in russia at that time were so separated from each other that nobility  of population and ordinary people might as well have been speaking different languages a rare occasional genius was able to grasp and show all the nuances of that division   tolstoy certainly had some sort of idealistic notions about peasants and peasant life working class merchants and other folks didnt interest him that much from what i gather which is not surprising people tend to idealize what they cannot fully comprehend but this man had the lucky opportunity of arguing his case while being surrounded by luxury taken care of by his numerous servants his wife being the main one bathing in privileges his title had bestowed upon him and reaping the fruits of his aristocratic background as in he found himself in the position of a person exposed to the ambiance that encourages knowledge and understanding of simple unsophisticated life of an average th century russian persond  i also believe that tolstoy was one of the most atrociously misogynistic seriously hateful writers of his time the fact that only bears relevance to this mess of a chaotic rant because his hatred shows in his work its definitely not reflective of russian culture like so many other aspects of his work that are based purely on his preconceived notions and personal beliefs rather than sociocultural nuances of his time  just take a close look at turgenev leskov ostrovskys heroines and youll see a huge gap between a dull unflattering and onedimensional portrayal of female characters of mr leo and multilayered complex and vivid images provided by above mentioned contemporaries of his who roughly speaking had similar education background and social standing  dostoyevsky goncharov chekhov kuprin just to name a few are a living testament nice pun innit it  to my suggestion that readers dont take whats written in tolstoys novels at face value and automatically consider it mere reflection of cultural norms of that time in my humble opinion this authors work should never be analyzed and reflected upon without learning some very telltale little facts from his biography i believe that one doesnt have to be wellversed in russian history or intimately familiar with russian culture to understand and appreciate tolstoys work  on the contrary learning more about the type of person he was firstly would be very helpful indeed in order to grasp the nuances of his books fifty shades of his personality left the biggest imprint on his novels  things that are hidden behind flowery language lofty ideas and forced idyll of ascetism and extreme spirituality that concerns with the human soul as long it serves as a theoretical tool the same soul that finds no compassion and loses its appeal once it has flesh and blood of a real human attached to it  by the way anna is the most cardboard aristocratic female character ive ever had the misery of reading xx i better not be supposed to sympathize with her when the russian elite first read this idyll to their vanity they must have fallen headlong into the reflecting pool right after narcissus for now you see not only are they rich and powerful but according to tolstoy theyre also supremely virtuous the theme of this book does the trick  say a painter decides to do a madonna and child looking around he frowns as he sees that this subject has already been painted thousands of times in every possible way over the ages to stand out he decides to paint the biggest baddest madonna and child ever such is tolstoys approach to the books theme an admiring homage to god family and class  though the author paints on a sprawling canvas this theme handcuffs the plot which gets so predictable that it can be seen hundreds of pages in advance more or less what will happen this same sprawl handcuffs character development because the characters have to be all bad or all good in order to make the authors point so the book needs exemplary writing in order to work  here however tolstoy never really trusts us to extract the message from his story he tends to spell it out for us in case we didnt get it the first time after a few promising paragraphs or pages the prose gets eclipsed by remarks better suited to religious tracts the kinds with cartoon crosses and all caps and a penchant for showing up anonymously in public places as a result too much of the author can be seen and not enough of his story  further damaging the narrative is the laughable misogyny by which the stepfordwife females make fools of themselves at one point for example three upper class women victoriously demonstrate to a dazzled peasant cook that their recipe makes the tastiest jam all through the book the corsetyanking writer pulls out every clich right down to the hooker with a heart of gold who mortified by her own scarlet shame literally with a shawl effaces herself before a rulingclass woman of virtue and promptly exits the stage after a disgraceful cameo  wed have a veritable encyclopedia of sexism except that these caricatures must in turn compete with more subtle excoriations of liberals the eponymous anna her eyes glittering showcases the stepbystep descent into nihilism that liberalism causes abetted by freethinkers and possibly even by atheists though more subtle this condemnation is still much too obvious to the reader  choking on dogma the story scrapes bottom awhile but luckily about page  the author drags the manuscript off the mortuary table and applies shock over the next  pages he tones down the agitprop and levins generally well written epiphany in the last  pages shoves this frankenstein past the finish line  the author tries to mine the same vein as dostoevsky another religious conservative but where dostoevsky succeeds brilliantly tolstoy fizzles the urge to moralize so impedes the narrative flow that it ruins the effect whats left is an archipelago of excellent prose floating on a pond of unctuous treacle  i wanted to give this novel at least some credit for these stretches of good writing but sadly the distractions in the writing conspired with a predictable plot and monochromatic characters to turn this book into a train wreck there are two problems with reading anything by leo tolstoy  that guy seriously needed an editor with a forceful personality as his most famous books are far too long  its nearly impossible to keep the characters apart because they all have something like  different names depending on the situation and social setting this is true of much of russian literature though for me its worst by far with tolstoy  i dont remember much about this book to be honest as i read it in the summer of  i do remember that by less than halfway through i didnt want to finish it and i only did finish it through sheer force of will i have this thing about finishing books ive started so i didnt want to read half of it and i couldnt keep straight who anyone waswhy the hell did i initially give this  stars gotta downgrade it to  thirty years ago i met a young woman in an unhappy marriage who told me this was the best book she ever read so about  years ago i tried to read it i really really did i got through about onefourth of this voluminous novel about the adulterous affair of a pampered member of the aristocracy who falls for a younger aristocrat  i desperately wanted to like it a classic its leo tolstoy its counted as one of the greatest works of literature ever fyodor dostoyevsky who penned the fabulous crime and punishment declared anna karenina to be flawless as a work of art what better recommendation could a novel have  but i couldnt get through any more than  percent of it  and that was a slog i hated anna i hated her ineffectual husband alexei alexandrovich i hated count vronsky i hated princess kitty i hated kittys entire superficial family i hated the ascetic levin really if you read anna karenina the russian revolution makes total sense early in the novel a railway worker falls into the path of a moving train and is killed a horrible human tragedy in which were moved to compassion nah to anna its merely the sign of upcoming bad luck for the members of her privileged set you see its all about us  i wanted to shout at these people whats wrong with you dont you realize you live in czarist russia are parties and dances and clothes all that you have to think about really thats the worst problem that you have youre obsessing about dance partners and the supply of goodlooking army officers havent you noticed these serfs all around you starvation misery homelessness freezing to death might not that be a little more important i was ready to join the bolshevik revolutionaries sing the internationale and overthrow these insufferable parasites myself  the superficiality of these people will make you want to grab a torch and pitchfork of your own and join the bolsheviks this book was the epitome of suffering from boredom   i know its only january but this will be my least fave book of the year as well as the longest yesterday i finished this book i started it in early july  and never put it down for more than oh a month at a time  infuriatingly boring the last  pages are a philosophical essay cloaked in fiction ie what if the character thought such and such and such a wholepage paragraph that would mean that the meaning of life is  i cant think of any reason tolstoy would have stuck this at the end of an page book unless a he was worried that the previous  pages didnt convey his purpose i think this is true andor b he realized his ideas were too halfassed to warrant a straightforward essay we suffer because we think too much and studying science will inevitably make us want to kill ourselves so we should just believe in god even though belief in god doesnt make any sense i need more than a novel to convince me  tolstoy succeeds at realism inasmuch as he makes up so many details that its easy to forget that hes making things up instead of describing a photograph i will give him that but from my historical position when realism is not bold and new the book only strikes me as a swollen insufferable narrative i dont see why he couldnt have accomplished everything he accomplished in a book onequarter the size  if youve already read the book and want to talk about the ideas or the character arcs i would be vaguely interested in such a conversation but i cant think of anyone i know to whom i would recommend an investment of time in this book i am satisfied that i read the whole thing only because it is a testimony to my stubbornness tlstoi is a great writer i hate anna arkadyevna karenina with all my soul and that i hate that she is a cheater and so weak ive said this before besides the rules of prose and writing and the standards of good literature any writer who creates emotion in the reader is a genious however im not the kind of person who thinks that classics should always receive at least  stars this was a dnf for me and i wont ever resume  i really dont understand i just dont get it this is one of the great novels i am just baffled was it because i listened to the audiobook instead of reading it or maybe it was the translation of the version that i had anna karenina is extremely long extremely slow and just when it would start to pick up the author would go off on tangents of crops and farming religion politics or something completely uninteresting or unimportant to the overall story i know im in the minority here but there were too many characters to remember i didnt find it poetic or romantic in the least and i feel like i wasted my time on this one well i cant say i didnt try i got about  in the book and couldnt take it any more this is one of those books i seriously wonder what other people see when they praise a book so highly and youre left thinking wtf am i missing i couldnt stand any of these characters anna was whiny and bitched about everything i found her so annoying  so before i threw the book across the room missing the trash can i read the last few chapters and im even happier i stopped now what a waste of time and paper i hate this novel heres why  a novel titled anna karenina should really be about anna karenina not only did her literal story take up a very negligent part of the book but the influence it had on the other characters was negligent as well tolstoy has no insights into her character or the reasons being any of her decisions he has some vague notion of her feelings as a mother and of her preoccupations as a lover but he has no idea what makes het work as a person nor does he care anna goes from being a vivacious but probably stifled woman who falls in love with the idea of excitement and romance to being the sort of spiteful morphine addicted hate filled woman who throws herself under a train to make the world feel her pain this change is not an organic transformation the suicide is not an organic resolution to annas journey as a character it doesnt even feel like tolstoy is punishing her as a fallen woman in a moral sense because her death is not shown to have any impact on anyone besides vronski tolstoy doesnt know why anna goes under that train and he doesnt bother to try and find out  levin all tolstoy cares about is levin his self insert character we get a painstakingly crafted intimate look at the innermost thoughts of a rich middle aged white dude this is such a rare unexplored often ignored demographic finally a worthy writer was able to give it a voice thank you tolstoy sarcasm aside levin is painfully boring except when hes wrong about something like the necessity of education at which point he becomes infuriating his brother is even worse  not the interesting one with the mistress and communist ideas the other one who wrote a book no one cared about levin is boring because he has no original character beats everything about him is telegraphed so far in advance that i knew he would find god ages before it was even a question  no one edited this book or at least that how it feels tolstoy writes nice sentences and sometimes he has strong scenes but he has no sense of flow chapters about one character and situation often follow by a chapter about something or someone completely different this ruins any sense of suspense and tension after all if the novel doesnt care about what just happened it couldnt have been that important for example annas death in the last chapter of part  is followed by a two months later  levins brothers book sucked and no one wanted to read it literally who edited this  there is the whole other issue of happiness and the only way of achieving it is by believing in god but i dont have the energy to direct my anger that way right now so thatll come in part two of the review once my rage subsides  i dont burn booksand my copy is digital but i really really wanted to burn this book but i wont id recycle it instead better for the environment besides im ok with tearing the pages out and getting them ready for the bin as a substitute for watching this monstrosity burn okay after months of reading this im finally dnfing it at  i just cant i hate the characters so much i really really really hated this book i read it voluntarily and i read the whole darn thing i kept thinking that i would reach some point where i would suddenly understand what makes this a great book but i just never found it certainly an educational experience but russian literature is not for me if anyone loves this book and can tell me why i would love to know i wept gloriously the day i stopped reading this book that ensuing week i just walked around regaling in my own unbearable lightness this book was a gift from my roommate no doubt to settle some grievance i was completely unaware of and after having my distressed head stuck in this tome for a few weeks god forbid you attempt to read this in a semirecumbent posture  if the weight of the book doesnt kill you the unbelievable monotony of the story will and watching everyone else in the anna kareninaless world move to the score of pachelbels canon with a spring in their step i gave up what is there to say about this book except fuck it and fuck the day i picked it up  little disclaimer to all the lovers of popular classics whose superiority complex relies only on that who cant believe i disliked this masterpiece and want to tell me how stupid i am how did you notice i thought i was hiding the fact that im a dumb fuck pretty well will have to work on that thank you this book brought my renewed attempt to read plan to a grinding halt it took me three whole months to plough through this  page book and it was through sheer will and ocd that i managed to finish reading the whole thing  i have slowly come to believe that several of the period classics do come with an expiry date at least as far as normal readers and notveryseriousstudentsofhistory are concerned i cannot believe that this story rambled on for so many many pages without really even telling any story or drawing me in as a reader  now i am all for character development and description of the scenery and surroundings however everything useful has its limits after which it becomes odious i was bored to tears with the number of times the local politics was discussed and the dryness of it all and i really could have survived without knowing down to the minutest detail the farming methods and implements used by levin one word which for me characterizes this book rambling  now the characters themselves  not one of them drew me in i was unable to empathize with a single one of them try as i might the protagonist anna has to be one of the most neurotic selfish persons ever written about and the way she has been described throughout the book was completely at odds with her nature we are repeatedly reminded of her good looks and her small delicate hands and her animated manner of speaking as if that somehow compensates for her being a horrible human being but perhaps what grated most on my nerves was just how much she was seemingly able to convey through her eyes somehow entire paragraphworthdescriptions of feelings and emotions were miraculously understood by her lover vronsky by just one look at her eyes either he was clairvoyant or he was able to absorb her brainwaves through osmosis it becomes difficult to respect the author when my intelligence as a reader is insulted so very much  descriptions apart the story itself was a problem a book needs to have a great plot or intricately etched believable characters or a gripping backdrop or a reasonable combination of all of these in order to hold a readers attention this book fails on all counts yes one does get some kind of an idea of the russian societys ways of the time however i would much rather pick up one of chekhovs short stories to get that flavour than waste three months struggling with a tome like this one  coming next to the plot itself anna is a woman who rouses absolutely no sympathy in me as a reader not because i am in a hurry to morally condemn her but because she is just a bad human being to everybody she comes into contact with very long story short she constantly wants what she cannot have and when she gets whatever it is that she wants now that she does have it naturally it loses all its value and she resumes wanting something else that she now cannot have and pining for it and making everybodys life miserable shudder  i am definitely not in a hurry to pick another of tolstoys books i now need to read several good books to recover from this one   get that everyone thinks this is great literature the bottom line for me was that it was a rotten story about a group of rotten people with a rotten ending i hated every character there was nobody i found to root for they were more than flawed they were despicable and worse than that they were annoying as can be it was a miserable read i cannot think of anything redeeming about it sorry i dont care if it is a classic it bit done donedonedonedonedone  ugh i have been picking up and putting dow this book for just over two years  i am very stubborn  parts of the story i actually quite enjoyed so i considered giving  stars but the ending ffs  annas story is interesting and i find her character interesting and if i were presented with this book with all the bits that dont concern her trimmed out i would probably actually like it  i found it hard to keep track of characters because i couldnt pronounce mostof them and i dont understand russian naming conventions that made it a bit hard to really get into the book at first and then just as i was maybe getting into it endless chapters about russian agriculture and politics and aaaaarrrrrrrgggghhhh  also the book is called anna karenina why does her story end about  into it and then we get a chunk of chapters about a budding war and an even bigger chunk of chapters of levin wrestling with the meaning of life seriously of the last  of this massive book maybe  can be even remotely connected to annas story the rest is the philosophical musings inside levins head which were painful to read  i totally get why the love story here is a classic and why people like but by da jesus the book is a hard slog not for me this could have been a mediumlong email  or  an averagely well written book about a bunch of russian aristocrats who find every possible way to ruin their lives  or  how to fool generations of readers by making them believe this is an important book when the author has the philosophical depth of a marvel comic and the characters are as interesting as watching an egyptian mummy decay  choose one of these three reviews i cannot be bothered wasting more time writing a longer one as this book doesnt deserve it and there is not much more to write about anyway just because you can write a  page book doesnt mean you should anna is a selfish mental case who should have met her end sooner the book went on and on about random politics farming methods searches for god and one chapter was from the point of view of the dog as hes gamehunting having read the notes about tolstoy it seems he was an adulterous oddball who didnt get religion so i guess he followed the advice to write what you know not a book worth reading and especially dont read this edition because the end notes are spoilers one of the most slow and boring books i have ever come across the story moves at a snails pace and that might be an exageration the ending is surprising and unexpected though i did not really see that one coming lengthy descriptions of characters clothing and furniture that is not important to the story at all i guess i am a practical reader give me what i need to understand the plot i can do without  pages full of fabric pattern descriptions i loved the first ish pages it all went downhill from there couldnt wait for it to endit was pure drudgery for mebut it was tolstoy right   all the russian names were confusing and they changed what they called each othermy goodness  the love story was good but all the detail about russian life in the wheat fields and such was just too much for me  i made my way through it but it wasnt a pleasurable readwell a few parts werent bad but for the most part i didnt like it  this novel was really really really bad maybe because i read it in arabic that i hate it this much i watched its movie and it was awesome i will read it again in english i think ill change my opinion then but as for now i can describe this novel in one word disappointing   to be reread soon this is so boring the actual story isnt this long were we supposed to sympathise with the characters god no i would not recommend to my enemies no wait maybe i should i like classics there are many i still want to read and anna karenina fell high on the list 
Frankenstein: The 1818 Text,of this book is just victor frankenstein falling into monthslong fevers at the slightest inconvenience and also being a colossal piece of shit the creature on the other hand is the postermonster for anyone whos ever felt othered and i simply love him  mary was  what  eighteen years old when she went on this famous holiday to lake geneva with percy bysshe shelley and byron and byrons physician she was calling herself mrs shelley though they had not yet married  percy was still married to someone else  the surroundings were familiar the last time mary and percy had come to switzerland had been during their elopement a couple of years earlier accompanied by her sister who was also in love with him mary had got pregnant but the baby girl was born prematurely and died in february  now they were back trying to put the past behind them and enjoy a holiday with byron who at the time was sleeping with marys stepsister percys first wife would soon be out of the picture found drowned in the serpentine in an advanced state of pregnancy before the year was out marys other sister fanny also drowned herself that year  also pining for percy  so it was in the midst of this complex lovedodecahedron that the holidaymakers their festive plans foiled by constant rain held their famous competition to write a ghost story the result is something very different from its image in popular culture instead of the smoke of victorian london we have the swiss alps and the orkney islands instead of igor and bolts through the neck we have meditations on personal autonomy scientific responsibility and eugenics  frankenstein is overwritten and the narrative structure is a bit odd  she was still a teenager when she wrote it lets not forget  but thematically its fascinating im surprised by how few reviews ive read touch on what seems to me to be the intensely female experiences that it obliquely comments on the confusion of bringing a creature into the world only to feel horror and revulsion towards it the stress of releasing it into a hostile and uncaring world and perhaps most of all the deep sympathy shown with someone who feels that their body is not their own that it is somehow owned and regulated by others a body that one is taught by society to hate the monsters feelings are unimportant because he was created by a man for the mans own gratification  mary quotes her beloved percy bysshe shelley unattributively when dr frankenstein first spots his creature up on the mer de glace she uses the final two stanzas from mutability for me though its the beautiful first stanza that better expresses the ferocious intensity of mary and her circle of friends and lovers surrounded as they all seemed to be by imminent premature death  we are as clouds that veil the midnight moon     how restlessly they speed and gleam and quiver streaking the darkness radiantlyyet soon     night closes round and they are lost forever   as they all were but the writing they left behind will last as long as english literature is read and for all of its problems frankenstein is among that select group the writing of the book is tedious or to be more accurate is a too slow burner that it took too much to get into the real story and even worse once the action started you have again intervals of tedium its indeed a roller coaster but in a bad sense since you took too much time in the tedious way up and the moments of intensity are like splitseconds on the way down  the narration style is odd since the book begins with some letters written by a ships captain and the first four letters are boring filler stuff nonrelevant to the actual story and until the fifth letter the story really started however later of that the narration changed to the voice of dr victor frankenstein but again our good mad scientist takes too much time to get to the point telling a lot of nonrelevant boring details even worse its told in the most tedious tone of voice that you can imagine without emotion or trying to entertain to the reader the chapters of the creature are more entertained but also sometimes you wonder how possible is that this monster so submitted to rage and murder is able to articule so well his part of the story  so between that the novel is slow burner and the moments of real horror with awful deaths are so scarce and presented so quick that you cant even develop the proper emotion on that moments i wasnt able to enjoy this book as i expected that i would however i cant deny the relevant place that this novel has in the history of literature and its impact in multiple ways of the spectrum  accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust  victor frankenstein the discouraged scientist reveals his horrific secrets on board a ship exploring the arctic ocean the old dream of a northwest passage being rescued from an ice flow he fears that no one will believe his story of creating a monster that viciously kills in the late s who would  at first the leader of the rugged crew the skeptical captain robert walton thinks frankenstein is insane after all victor was found

he victor frankenstein attends the university in ingolstadt bavaria germany studying chemistry  the gifted young man soon becomes the top student in school even more amazingly surpassing the professors who are surprised to say the least by his great ability frankenstein gets the bright idea it will cause unforeseen difficulties in the future to bring to life a new man out of different body parts the first mad scientist in history still getting cold feet when the dead creature unbelievably comes alive the petrified victor runs away like a coward not caring of the consequences to others their safety is not important just his  when frankenstein nerves calm down he finally returns and the monster is gonemonthsslowly pass but when a member of his family is brutally murdered frankenstein knows who is responsible the conscience  stricken gentleman has no choice  meeting the frightening ugly hideous looking abomination on top of a cold glacier victors creation demands that

 they finally stop on a remote island off the coast of scotland sending the very reluctant henry away and getting back to business he has a lot of hard work to do  a new atrocity  to create a female nevertheless frankenstein has many second thoughtsdoes he really want a new tribe of monstrous people all butchers capable of taking over the entire world yet the problem is that frankensteins fiend has threatened to destroy his whole family if he doesnt comply with his request make that demand what would you do  the first modern sciencefiction book written in the early th century   still entertains mary shelley was  and began the story as a teenager a talented woman shows the boys how its done and the rest is history  stars rounded down  his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautifulgreat god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips  i was more than just a little excited to pick up this enduring and quite popular classic gothic horror novel for the second time i was convinced that this would go straight to my favorite books of alltime shelf after all my lukewarm reception to it more than twentyfive years ago was probably a bit unsound lacking the appreciation it so deserved well i am not here to say that i disliked the book not at all but i feel somewhat sorry to say that i cant honestly give it a place on my cherished books list i also feel a bit isolated by the fact that nearly all of my goodreads friends have rated this at least a star or two higher than my own  rounded down to  star rating  okay now that i have that guilty feeling expressed and out of the way i will just try to quickly mention my thoughts on the book i think just about everyone here knows the gist of the story remember this is not my first reading so i absolutely didnt go into it with the expectation that it would match the feel of the film or television adaptations in fact when i began reading i was immediately mesmerized the beginning portion of the book with the bleak and desolate description of the arctic landscape and the first glimpse of the gigantic creature by captain walton revealed mary shelleys exquisite writing skills i loved the way we are introduced to the monsters creator victor frankenstein we learn of his story as told by him to walton his narrative and that of the monster are woven cleverly together so that we fully comprehend the feelings of both the creator and his creation like their fellow humans frankenstein sought knowledge while walton additionally sought adventure at what point does mankinds challenge of nature and power cause destruction and ruin frankenstein thirsted to push the limits of mans wisdom by daring not only to learn but to create  a power perhaps reserved for some being or entity outside the realm of our own jurisdiction a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs  his arrogance must have consequences of course he ultimately rejects that which he has created his creation is then cast aside by others as he is judged by his ghastly appearance rather than his character he is left alone and isolated from any kind of companionship or love the essence of the creature suffers and he takes on those inner characteristics which humanity has carelessly bestowed him with  he becomes a monster both creator and monster suffer as a result of their individual actions and consciences victor frankenstein laments anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish the monster bemoans remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed every where i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend  undeniably there is a strong message within this book and it is delivered quite clearly by shelleys powerful writing this aspect of the novel definitely appeals to me as do the descriptions of the scenery  the majestic alps the serenity of the rhine river valley and the stark and relentless ice of the arctic what caused my rating to dip further than i had hoped was the endless wailing of victor frankenstein much of the narrative became rather repetitive resulting in my wish to hurry along to the end so i suppose it is fair to say that while the moral of the story and the brilliance of mary shelley are to be commended especially given the time in which this was written my ultimate enjoyment was a tad diminished of course her ideas have relevance even today as mankind still seeks that which is just beyond its grasp glad to knock it off my list classics  halloween i really want to give it at least  stars but after  it almost went into dnf shelf some sections dragged out a bit too much funny that i enjoy most of the movies more  seeing that most paperbacks are under  pages not sure why this audiobook was h m long an extended edition of some kind whoh this is so lame i say  avoid i thought frankenstein would rock but it really doesnt i seen a lot of frankenstein movies and this is nothing like them there are no vampires like in vampire girl vs frankenstein there are no lesbians like in lust for frankenstein there are no sks like in frankenstein was jack the ripper there is just jawbreaking philosophical like debate well it would break your jaw in four places if you tried to read this stuff out aloud i fell asleep five times during the reading of a single page true now the author was a young girl she was like only  and she was living a pretty wild rock  roll lifestyle with a bunch of poets at the time but you wouldnt know from this book theres no sex in it theres some murders and body parts but man not enough for me frankenstein doesnt even get burned in the end or eaten by nymphomaniacs like in frankenstein vs the nymphomaniacs he just like wanders off into the arctis not realistic at all a recent review triggered my own distant memory of this iconic classic frankenstein contributed to the leaning tower of novels presented to me as a sixteenyearold english lit student  sadly bolts protruding from necks are in short supply and it is impossible to feel anything but sympathy for the monster who is born to a life of abandonment loneliness and anguish its astonishing to think that shelley was so young when she created this an iconic classic deserving of our most fulsome praise that said i found the book unendingly melancholic and a tad onepaced pray tell me your story i said if it will not weary you overmuch  he fixed me with an eye still firm of purpose i had long been fascinated by the dark arts of parody and homage he began i studied the works of the masters juvenal swift beerbohm douglas adams i curse the day when i discovered the grimoire of john sladek mouldering in an old bookshop it was then my plan began to take shape  he broke off racked by a fit of coughing sir you should rest i said he snorted contemptuously and continued  the rest of this review is available elsewhere the location cannot be given for goodreads policy reasons frankenstein is the first book written by mary shelley daughter of mary wollstonecraft and william godwin wife of percy bysshe shelley friend of lord byron and her most famous first published in  she later revised it for its second printing in  adding a preface that cleared up conjecture as to what she was writing about changing the relationship of elizabeth to the family in the original she is victor frankensteins cousin in the second she has no blood relation but was adopted by the family to remove any suggestion of incest and she also removed any hint that frankenstein created the creature out of vice  if youre not familiar with the story as shelley wrote it frankenstein is about a young swiss man dr victor frankenstein who is a student of the natural sciences he becomes absorbed by the idea of creating a living being and spends two years collecting body parts from the deceased and feverishly working in his laboratory but when he instils it with life and it wakes and looks upon its creator victor is horrified and flees from his creation  he spends months in illness nursed by his best friend henry clavel before returning to his fathers home in geneva switzerland where his two brothers earnest and william and his adopted sister elizabeth live his mother has already passed away before leaving ingolstadt in germany where he was living and studying at the university he receives a letter from his father telling him that his little brother william has been murdered  on his arrival to his home town he sees his creature in the dark wilderness and becomes convinced it murdered william a servant girl justine is accused and hanged for the crime and victor goes traipsing off into the wilderness with his depression he encounters the creature who begs him to listen to his story and we learn what has passed with the monster since victor created and abandoned it it is a heartbreaking story and goes some way to explaining the monsters mind  the monsters main purpose in telling victor his story is to beg him to create a companion for him a woman of his own species victor at first agrees going to britain with henry and collecting new body parts but he destroys the being before bringing it to life and in retribution the monster kills henry victor is accused and spends some months in an irish gaol before being released upon returning home to geneva with his father he marries elizabeth who the creature strangles to death on their wedding night  his father dies from the shock of all these tragedies and victor chases after the monster determined to end it once and for all the chase takes them to the northern alps and continues across the ice in sleds before victor is rescued from an accident and taken on board a ship that has been trapped in the ice he tells the captain his story who writes it all down to send to his sister back home before he weakens and dies the monster returns and pledges his own suicide by fire since there is no more reason for him to live  i did enjoy this though its not an easy read in the sense that the writing style is for want of a better word awkward often clumsy when i think about it its accurate enough for a story retold by one man captain waldon as told from memory by another victor who in turn retells other peoples stories namely the monsters in such a case details are bound to get lost in the retelling though of course the dialogue is accurately remembered but it does make it hard going at times i kept getting pulled up short by glaring omissions or confusing jumps as someone in my bookclub put it the story is good the book not so great  frankenstein could easily be described as timeless since theres little that anchors it firmly in the period in which it is set s and you can read all sorts of relevant themes into it shelley apparently wrote it as a warning to scientists and against the industrial revolution in general reminding them that they are not god and of the dangers of overreaching themselves i would take it a step further and say it is a warning against not taking responsibility for your actions especially those of science in delving into new and strange areas like nuclear weapons cloning etc right up to the end victor thinks he is blameless  during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and wellbeing this was my duty but there was another paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness and misery p  so although he can acknowledge that he was responsible for the creature he does not see any connection between his neglect of the monster and the way the monster turned out in other words if he had stayed by the creatures side taught him ethics morals etc he would have preserved the lives of his own loved ones and the greater populace in general  the nameless creature was abandoned by victor because it was ugly thats it he was fugly  i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room p  talk about shallow the creature left to his own devices with no language and no knowledge but that victor is his creator yearns to be loved and wanted stumbling through the countryside he discovers fire discovers berries and things to eat but is persecuted and beaten by any humans he comes across he tries so hard and while he does not make the best decisions he has the mind of a child in a giants body and with his unusual circumstances should hardly be judged along the same lines as anyone else victor creates a monster by seeing only a monster without taking the time to learn its true nature as does everyone else they could not look beyond appearances  even today we would probably react in the same way that doesnt make it any less our fault for creating a being with so many faults in this case it is the lack of nurture  ie its environment  that created the ture monster not nature its not that i seek to justify the murders the creature committed but the creature wasnt born evil he was turned evil by humans grrr i just didnt like victor and wish he had been more accountable for being so irresponsible yes he was young enthusiastic and thought he could take gods place  a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs p  this is the meaning behind the subtitle the modern prometheus prometheus was a titan whom zeus punished eternally for creating men out of clay and bringing fire from the heavens and gifting it to humans zeus chained him to a rock and every day a bird would peck out his liver only to have it grow back so the next day a bird could do it again nice so is the loss of victors family his best friend and his bright future his punishment  another reason why i dont like victor frankenstein is that he is so selfish arrogant selfcentred selfindulgent melodramatic and egotistical aside from wanting to bring dead body parts to life so that he could be worshipped like a god the fate of justine for example brings out his true character  despair who dared talk of that the poor victim justine who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony p  yes not even poor innocent justine sent to the gallows for a crime wholly victors fault suffered as much as he he could have stepped in and confessed but did not want people to think him mad add proud to the list of his sins if you please later he marries elizabeth despite the monsters threat that he will come to him on his marriageday its always about him he doesnt notice the pattern of the monster murdering his family and friends in order to make him feel this misery and so realise its his bride the monster will target no its all about him victor  he marries elizabeth making her just as miserable as he is and took her to a secluded place where he intended to go headtohead with the monster only to find elizabeth strangled to death in the bedroom he puts people in danger then whines about how miserable and wretched he feels when they die yet doesnt seem to regret anything  this is just my take on the book and like true art it can be read in a number of ways its definitely a good idea to read the book to know the story though because the movies that have been made about frankenstein since the s are way off the mark though i would imagine studying the popular culture side of the story would be just as fascinating as studying the book itself  a note about this edition this is a handsome book with nice thickish yellowish oldstyle paper and print it looks exactly like how it was originally published but there are no notes or appendices or introduction so if youre studying this book you might want to get a different edition its also the revised edition not the original  one though the revised one is more common now  frankenstein is one of those classics i seemed to know a lot about without ever actually reading it or seeing any adaptations of it but the story of the monster created by frankenstein is such a well known one and i have wanted to read this classic for a long time to actually get the full story  frankenstein follows victor frankenstein a young man who attends university to study science discovers the secret of life and uses the knowledge to animate a corpse made up of various body parts frankenstein and his creation then engage in a catandmouse game for the next  pages both inexplicable drawn to eachother despite their repulsion and horror toward eachother  i could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other   first of all i have to put in a note about my main girl mary shelley i love her i love that she penned this story while hanging out with percy shelley and lord byron and won their scary writing competition she also lost her virginity on her mums grave which is hardcore and kept her dead husbands calcified heart in a box for years and years she is literally the coolest and i think that is important to note  but that aside i very much enjoyed the character dynamics in this shelley draws interesting parallels between victor and the monster as well as parallels between victor as god and the monster as adam or lucifer in paradise lost i liked the comparisons here and how this book forces you to consider the line between god and monster the romanticism was strong here obviously since this is the romantic text but i love the romantics and the literature they produced except wuthering heights which can choke so i enjoyed seeing how romanticism had influenced the story  discussions around morality and humanity were also central here the positioning of the monster as inhuman and victor as human became more and more blurred as the story progresses the monster himself was more of a sympathetic character than i expected but it added an interesting dynamic and one i hadnt really gleaned through the popular representations of frankensteins monster    i also really liked the writing although at times i think it did err on longwinded overall i think the prose was quite beautiful and again shelley utilised literary and biblical allusions really well in frankenstein i found this so easy to read for a classic the writing was fairly straight forward and understandable  the reason i give this a three star rather than four is because i just found the book didnt draw me in as well as some other classics i often was checking the page number i was on i think this was a combination of the slow moving plot and writing when it became longwinded and drawn out i also just found some of victors thought process infuriating and overall he was an extremely annoying character which sort of took me out of the story at times so while i did find this interesting and enjoyable it just didnt click with me like some other classics have  overall frankenstein is definitely worth reading though its a classic take on humanity and what makes a person truly human with interesting character dynamics and straightforward language it is also worth reading just to put respect on the good sister marys name i had a fun time with this one but i dont know if i would ever reread it  accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust this is a beautifully and dramatically told story shelleys prose is fantastic i thought wow that is just so perfectly captured beautifully written impeccably described i particularly adored her description of landscapes  the towering alps the majestic jura mountains the verdant lush countryside around oxford scottish moors the riverbanks of the rhine even the orkney islands she captures the beauty of a summer day the drama of a threatening storm and the silence and cold and stillness of polar regions she expresses anger and despair and utter loneliness movingly i simply cannot give a book with such wonderful prose anything less than three stars  keep in mind i do not usually read science fiction  everyone knows that in frankenstein a monster is created victor frankenstein a swiss natural scientist of the late s has figured out how to turn inanimate objects into living creatures creatures that feel and think this is the given you just have to accept how this is done is not detailed the focus of the book is instead how people react to the creature he is frighteningly ugly what we are delivered is a commentary on human behavior  if we assume that what we are told is true this creature shares with us human emotions his emotions and the emotions of his creator are the fulcrum of the tale that this is an imaginary creature is not really the point except perhaps as a cautionary tale how would you feel if your kindness help and benevolence toward others were always repaid with disgust fear and hatred would you calmly accept that you were rebuffed disregarded and frozen out wouldnt you get mad wouldnt you feel unjustly treated were your own life devoid of all happiness and one of complete isolation wouldnt you be infuriated at and envious of those who have more might you not seek revenge this book is about how people treat each other and so of course the monster too  ambition is another theme take care that you dont push ambition too far and think twice about that which you create i found the lesson imparted obvious  the one character i could relate to was the monster  i like credibility victor frankenstein can scarcely be viewed as credible in his role as a scientist there is a sea captain and he is not credible either sea captains are made of tougher stuff than the one drawn here  i dont go for pushing something to the extreme you push anything too far and it loses all credibility the book does this the number who die in this book are many  maybe my real problem with this book is that the messages imparted are not new  i listened to the audiobook narrated by dan stevens this audiobook follows the authors first writing of the story the  edition audible offers the  edition too that one is narrated by derek jacobi so one is free to choose the  edition begins with a quote from john miltons paradise lost did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me this says a lot it is a perfect beginning to the story the quote is removed from the  edition i appreciated how the volumes and chapters are organized in the  edition the presentation of stories within stories is cleverly done the  edition has a preface detailing how the story came to be but that can be found on wiki  at the start i liked the narration in the beginning it is not overly grim later we are given two first person narratives we hear of the events both from the monsters and his creators point of view both are extremely distressed they are dejected melancholic and full of despair this makes the story terribly depressing to listen to hour after hour such gloom we are delivered accurate presentations of the characters moods but i prefer less dramatization most eat up such narrations so you can just ignore my view  not a wow book but i am glad i read it this is a philosophical novel venerable for when it was written and its influence astonishing that the author mary shelley was so young  it is not in the least scary it is not to be placed in the horror section the scenes one anticipates to be horrific or startling for the fame of the book means that even a first time reader will have many preconceptions are actually mundane or at best cerebral  it is akin to wells island of dr moreau or the much more recent jurassic park from crichton it is not like poe or the ghost stories of antiquity its about how humans do things to see if they can rather than because they should something like what jeff goldbloom famously says in the film version of the aforementioned dinosaur tale  modern readers may find much of it boring there are parts that devolve into contests between the creator and his monster to decide who is more miserable the ending is anticlimactic still the writing is solid and it deserves high praise for its originality an enjoyable book i would like to add my voice to the chorus of voices that tell you that this is not like any of the stories and preconceptions you come to it with  in other words no boris karloff and the metal rods poking out of the neck no bobby boris pickett and monster mash playing as you flip through the pages what i loved about the book was the depth of understanding displayed at times by a teenage mary shelley though i am sure more was added to the book over the years and in subsequent revisions there was a time in my life where i thought i would become a physician myself so the trials and tribulations of victor frankenstein within academia were not unknown to me  on a slightly unrelated note i have been listening to the red hot chili peppers religiously once again as i am getting ready to see them in concert next year the front man of the band anthony kiedis had a famously weird relationship with his father blackie dammett who recently passed away in may there is a famous interview with blackie on youtube where he is rationalizing for his behaviour with young anthony thi
Tuesdays with Morrie,ugh it was like stapling together eighty greeting cards and reading them straight through hate if i were to die unexpectedly i wouldnt be ashamed in the least of someone finding my porn stash and by the way that video isnt bestiality its just two guys in a moose suitbig difference id have a more difficult time explaining why i have the first season of  on my ipod something i downloaded for a friends fourteenyearold daughter i swear note to self delete it now im more worried about someone coming across tuesdays with morrie or eat pray love in my book collection i have some explaining to do  like any pseudointellectual dipshit i wouldnt normally be caught dead with pieces of pop trash like those two ginormous bestsellers in my library but i believe that given my current living situation there are extenuating circumstances i buy books compulsively especially when theyre really inexpensive i pass by a pawn shop about once a month to buy books for  each books in spain are generally a bit expensive so at this price ill buy almost anythingeven the offal mentioned above i give away lots of books to friends and acquaintances especially when they come this cheaply  i actually read tuesdays with morrie or at least i speedread part of it for the purposes of this essay and id read eat pray love some years ago or at least most of it both are best sellers meant for people who almost never read theyre books for people who claim a book is brilliant simply because they were able to finish it  look everyone im reading im really reading they shout in glee  i think anything people read is better than not reading but thats all the praise i have for these particular works promising to give the reader the deep secrets to the meaning of life any book claiming to explain lifes mysteries should set off the alarms for anyone with half a brain books like the bible the talmud and the koran fall into this category of snake oil literature  im sorry folks there are no answers in life theres only wisdom and wisdom takes time certainly more than the  pages that make up tuesdays with morrie  answers are simply created by people who are terrified that there might not be answers  the problem is when religions or the mitch alboms and elizabeth gilberts of the world start infringing on the domain of the rational with their moronic explanations of the spiritual or existential i would say that these institutions religions and hack writers constantly violate the airspace of the rational and scientific  tuesdays and eat claim to be instruction manuals for life or at least imply it they have about as much spiritual depth as a newspaper horoscope or a fortune cookie in the case of the aphorisms in tuesdays id say they were pretty lousy fortune cookies a few examples  learn to forgive yourself and forgive others accept the past as past and what you are not able to do dont assume that its too late to get involved   morrie is certainly a fountain of banalities whenever people ask me about having children or not having children i never tell them what to do why the fuck would he he was a sociology professor not heinrich himmler  wisdom is difficult to define but i think i know it when i see it i aint seeing it here  ps if i dated a girl who had this book on her bed table i would probably escape by jumping out her third story bathroom window it would creep me out like when that girl saw the fingernails on the wall in silence of the lambs  pps i wrote this mainly to get a few laughs if you dont think the review is funny it may just mean that you are a normal welladjusted human being people who write comedy arent before you crucify me in the comments of this review i suggest you read one of my reviews of a book that i loved there are many im not always cynical skeptical  afterword liz goodreads friend mentioned that saint mitch albom is actually a fullblown asshole who is completely contemptuous of people with shitty minimum wage jobsa more accurate description is the working poor how dare i have to repeat what i said to you about my coffee order i dont care if you are distracted because you are worried sick because you dont have health care or a dental plan and forget about making ends meet yes the poor are to blame for the downfall of our republic or whatever it is   i have decided to delete this review it was not my intention to upset anyone who either suffered from the disorder discussed in this book nor anyone related to such a person see comment   nonetheless i still believe this to be a particularly poorly written book that contains more saccharine than substance  still if it brings you some sense of comfort  more strength to you  i have chosen not to delete the comments thread as not all of the comments are mine to delete im ashamed to own that ive read this all i can say is i did it for a good cause that is to promote reading in general for a library talk  mawkishly sentimental here i am trying to wipe off the stale stench of yesterdays coffee mornings and terribly trite  any person leaning to the left should or would recognise what mitch is talking about it isnt that morrie is talking shit he isnt however i think its terribly ironic that such a venture it screams selfhelp and it will touch you has been undertaken by mitch i bet ol morrie is really angry now its like encouraging capitalism by using marx the stuff in there about wanting money etc its all in marx  heres my tip ditch the book and either meet morrie impossible or read marx or any other marxist recommended even morries essays presumably if available would probably be a good read its mitch thats the problem the moneygrubbing critter that he is  ps as an aside its sad to note how things that start off really radical get coopted in the most tragicomic ways possible of all the glorious books out there my school could have picked for ninth grade literature class  in the words of marcus aurelius despise not death but welcome it for nature wills it like all else thats one significant message mitch albom tries to convey to us readers in this emotional ride tries not quite being the key word but even so eliciting only limited success more on that later ahead tuesdays with morrie depicts the moving relationship between the author and his former professor morrie schwartz it delves into the strong bond they begin to develop over time as mitch shares morries lasting gift with the universe   ooooooh   the book circulates around various sentimental themes love family friends relationships happiness and death expressed through morries personal experience in terms of language and style of writing mitch likes to keep it simplistic and casual so to say but maintains that sombre mood surrounding his teachers demise we can see that hes supportive of him and his ideals curious to learn more but its hard to forget about the tragedy that is bound to come is it not some readers will become attached to morrie and mourn over his departure but the hopes he gives them from his teachings is enough to satisfy and not leave you in an emotional wreck notice how i say some and not all now despite the generally morbid theme concerning morries impending death the presence of aphorisms and anecdotes manage to make the situation more acceptable and less heartbreaking mr albom successfully lightens the mood throughout the book but unfortunately ends up overdoing it a bit okay a lot at least in my opinion now this is where the problems begin to sprout  the way morrie finds the best in his sufferings and shares his knowledge of the world should make us experience the urge to adapt that into our own lifestyle granted that impulse might stay there for a couple days but it utterly fails to leave a permanent mark upon me the whole plotline is presented in such a drastically sappy manner that it makes you feel like youre reading a compilation of those cheesy motivational wall decors everyone detests in the form of a paged overly hyped bestseller in his attempt to avoid a depressing atmosphere mitch overflows his novel with excessive words of wisdom imparted through a rare year old words that im sure all of us have heard one too many times and presented in a rather unoriginal fashion so why should this spontaneously change our views on living any differently  i am well aware of the fact that this was published over a decade ago and not having read many or any other similar nonfictional books along this vein i wouldnt really know if tuesdays was a burst of something fresh back in its day but even if it wasnt a considered a clich when it was first released the fact that we are expected to finally understand the deep meanings of life and have it create an impact is far beyond unrealistic what i did understand was that the criticality of this novel stems from alboms desire for his audience to think about and learn from the piece like so many others alas his intentions to bestow a load of inspiration upon us only resulted in making you eat it up but not fully digest it  in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this particular book for anyone facing troubles in their life aka everyone but who knows maybe im just an extremely pessimistic critic over the issue and this jumble of typical wise quotes might end up inspiring you if only just a tad bit being an avid reader of fantasy books it is only once in a blue moon that i find myself indulging in a spiritual book such as this one but it saddens me to say that tuesdays with morrie has turned out to be one of the least influential books ive read among others  why yes this is in fact my school essay because im too lazy to rant over it again goodreads style p i cannot remember my reason why i dnfd this popular book considering to reread it but i lost it completely i can no longer find it around the house a genuinely abysmal work in which a college student condescends to an old man because he is old and the writer isnt one of the reviewers said it is filled with the wisdom we should all know and that is true in fact i suspect everyone reading already knows what albom is learning so that is exhilarating to certain kinds of readers not to me theres a common belief that the dying once terminal are imbued with a wisdom none of the rest of us can touch and if we would only pause at their feet to listen we could live out the rest of our lives with renewed vigour and purpose tuesdays with morrie takes this poisonous conceit and runs with it for  insufferable pages all the way to the bank both the author and his subject are sufficiently selfobsessed to judge the rest of humanity for failing to follow their bland clicheridden philosophy every second of every day i can take a bit of wellmeaning tosh but these two only mean to criticise your wasteful life unless youre sitting in your living room listening to classical music in a state of meditative detached bliss then youre all right  then theres the writing itself so burdened with repetition and explication you could almost read every second page and have the same experience try mans search for meaning instead theres a great book about living and dying cutting to the chase and saying this book is stupid seems a bit insensitive so ill try to air my grievances in a less awful way  i feel like i got more out reading the description on the books jacket than i did reading the actual novel i went into twm with an open mind i wasnt aware that it was going to have a selfhelp live everyday like its your last sort of tone twm had the potential to be a great book i read somewhere that the book was turned into a play i feel like that could actually work but unfortunately albom reduced it to condescending drivel  one of my problems as a reader was that i learned more about the narrator than i did about morrie i know more about morries impact on the author than i do about morrie himself the bits we do learn abouthis childhood his support of student protests etcwere actually compelling much to my chagrin however the author chose to martyr morrie and reduce him to something resembling a cross between yoda and a fortune cookie undoubtedly morries aphorisms were profound and mostly accurate however i wanted to know how his aphorisms came to be  i understand why people would enjoy this book however twm isnt for me its a bit too sentimental for my taste but i dont want to ridicule the people who found this book comforting besides its short i wouldnt consider this book a waste of time whats really sad about this book is how philosophically void and flimsy the whole thing is another reviewer compared it to reading eighty hallmark gift cards straight through which is not inaccurate while some of the things morrie says are true and insightful it takes a lot of digging through dirt to find any gems most of the stuff you could get out of this just comes through common sense or reading books that are far greater albom is an extremely schmaltzy writer his maudlin sentences almost had me choking on their revolting triteness its clearly a book written for people who never read and people who never think for that matter if you want something thats actually insightful true wise and deathconscious i recommend picking up a bible and reading solomons proverbs and ecclesiastes while tuesdays with morrie might make you a little less selfcentered for only a fleeting moment the wisdom and knowledge of solomon reverberates forever  it is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting for death is the destiny of everyone the living should take this to heart  solomon ecclesiastes  schmaltzy and horrible  whatever i wanted morrie to die the whole time i was reading the book so it would end already i remember being forced to read this in high school and just staring in bafflement at the largeprint text spelling out lessons that could only be meant for kindergarteners and being even more baffled when my classmates expressed how deep it was and how i never thought about how im eventually gonna die before seriously youre fifteen years old and never once thought about death you didnt lose a grandparent or greatgrandparent or hamster growing up you neve watched the lion king or the nature channel or go to sunday school no not every kid does any of those things but even ones that dont do any of those should still be thinking hard about death as soon as they learn what death even is i cant fathom how you couldnt  i felt at age fifteen that this book was insulting to my intelligence not only were the morals all obvious but the fake sympathy the author expresses for morrie was so corny and sappy that i didnt believe any of it and that is disturbing since morrie was a real guy who really died a slow awful death and as others have pointed out mitch didnt even know morrie that well he only became interested in the poor man when he learned the guy was dying slowly and tragically and hey what a coincodink mitch just happened to be a writer who could make a fortune i mean tell your story to the world morrie  i feel bad for morrie and his family and if this book helped preserve his memory then at least something good came from it but i still feel that mitch albom was a hack who wrote  pages of crocodile tears to squeeze money and fame out of a poor old mans death alboms recent online post about baristas would seem to confirm his lack of empathy for others and sense of entitlement i read this book because i found it on a friends bookshelf and everyone i know strongly recommended it i tried to keep an open mind while reading it but ultimately found the book very disappointing  first of all it was written on perhaps a th grade reading level given the seriousness of the subject matter i found this highly inappropriate  second of all by the end of the book it became clear to me that if morrie was a great man mitch album is not a good enough writer nor a smart enough person to be able to encapsulate morries greatness in writing morries wisdom comes off as random and disjointed as though he is articulating not wisdom but raw emotion as i read through the book i found myself thinking this is the man theyre calling a hero  but by the end of the book i had to admit that the real problem was mitch album he just isnt a good enough writer for something like this i cringed often and this is not the kind of book one wants to cringe through very disappointing its been a while since i read this and i will admit that i didnt finish it  came close  and i only read it because it was around in a group house i was living in at that time but i am pretty sure that this is absolutely the the worst book that i have ever ever read if it was just supposed to be light and didnt have any ambition of being emotionally instructive and fundamentally life altering i wouldnt have been so aggravated but oh no no this book aimed to open our minds and change our lives by combining the most trite obvious insights with heartbreaking personalscale tragedy ie one person dying a painful horrible death from a debilitating debilitating disease  the triteness comes from the dying guys friend i cryed for the poor man dying and rolled my eyes over and over and over reading the insights of the other guy  it was an unbearable emotional experience did i mention that its also a hallmark movie like many of other famous booksdisappointing   this book wouldnt have been so bad if the reader wasnt bludgeoned with the lessons of life the tone became preachy i understand that morrie had the ability to look at life differently because he was dying but you cant expect people who arent in the same circumstances to have that perspective i just didnt get anything from this book god i just drank some rye and suddenly remembered how much i hate this book now im going to continue to get shitfaced watch the bank dick by wc fields and wash the taste of the memory that i have of this sentimental trash out of my brain once you learn how to die you learn how to live  this book would have floored me a good ten to fifteen years back but now it just seems superfluous and didactic it is stitched out of quotable quotes that one pins on a board during throes of teenage angst the book itself is pseudophilosophical and mawkish despite the contents being narrated out of real life events  what we take we must replenish its only fair  the narrator seems too acquiescent to allow mere generalisations on life change his personal perspective sure death of a loved one and especially conversations with someone on their deathbed can influence us greatly but this inspiration is greatly exaggerated in the book add to that the sanctimonious claims made by professor morrie and the book becomes a nuisance to the aesthetic and philosophic senses of the reader his selfrighteousness negates all the hoitytoity facts of life one is supposed to accept at mere face value  accept the past as past without denying it or discarding it  another major irritant of the book was its undue emphasis on love this is clearly a product of western philosophy which has not only distorted the image of love but has also overstated its utility in ones life all this has come at the cost of undervaluing kindness which in my opinion is more indispensable to humanity love is a byproduct of kindness and not the other way around kindness can be exercised without actually loving someone but love without benevolence of thought and emotion consideration and compassion is vacuous  you know what really gives you satisfaction what offering others what you have to give you sound like a boy scout i dont mean money mitch i mean your time your concern your storytelling its not so hard  tuesdays with morrie is a vapid read no matter how much the author distances himself from the book being labelled as a selfhelp book the mismatched sweeping statements which are supposed to give the reader astounding insight into life scream of insipidity  aging is not just decay you know its growth its more than the negative that youre going to die its also the positive that you understand youre going to die and that you live a better life because of it mitch albom writes like a migraine  incessant painful writing that lances its message over and over with little to no regard for subtlety but perhaps worst of all is that despite all of this neither he nor morrie actually ends up saying anything at all the complex questions of life are simplified and reduced to mere meaningless aphorisms once you learn how to die you learn how to live dont cling to things because everything is impermanent these are all of them the most trite and worn platitudes  memento mori carpe diem dust in the wind etc  and while theyre all doubtlessly true the truth within them is something we lose consciousness of from time to time it takes a good writer like say leo tolstoy to awaken that consciousness rather than the hapless and pretentious bromides of some consolatory greeting card hack consider this golden tip from morrie dont let go too soon but dont hold on too long what kind of absolutely vacant advice is that how could anyone dispute such vacuously true nonsense imagine someone trying to give you directions and telling you dont go too far but make sure you go far enough to get there well no fcking sht dumbass god i hate this book  i only have it in my collection actually i only have it at all because it was given to me freely by my undergraduate university as an this author is coming to visit here read his book this was back in  the book was banal and touchyfeely and very short and even as it ended it never answered any of the few questions it raised for me such as did albom every work things out with his wife i went to the lecture because it was the first author lecture id had the opportunity to go to  the lecture was worse albom didnt give a lecture at all just read a chapter from his book the first chapter even not even picking an excerpt like this is a favorite excerpt of mine and heres why and id like to read to you albom answered no questions and provided no information beyond what was found in the book during the book signing the single word i heard him say to any student was name and i made a point of saying thank you for coming to him as he signed my copy even taking into effect how hard book tours can be on an author i think he could have taken the lecture and signing more professionally  i love books and therefore tend to be positive about my critiques including when i review books for publication but sometimes a book is so ghastly it deserves special attention this is such a book im not saying albom cant write a nice sentence and im not denying there is a certain compelling beauty and shape to the book the problem is other than cashing in big time ive never heard or seen a single indication that albom actually lives by the wisdom he claims to have downloaded from morrie i mean in no way of course one cant live up to all the good advice one hears  or hawks  but  some movement in that direction doesnt seem like too much to ask i hate this book yeah this is what middle class america want death to be a sort of receipt of how meaningful our existence were but reality check death is not a festive event where you get to conclude your accumulated wisdom to friends and family in most cases it is frightening lonely painful and should nonetheless render our unyielding support unconditionally as a physician this book and its new agey tone is downright insulting to me  a burden to those afflicted by illnesses that are incurable and who thanks to gibberish like this are expected to lay dying like buddhist zen masters gag this kind of book rarely interests me very much as i feel like an alltooobvious message is hammered home from the opening few pages this book fits that description to a tee and i am hardly inspired to read other mitch albom books in the future i have no idea why this became a bestseller completely cheesy and forgettable throughout this book i saw a ton of potential that was never actualised i thought of mitch alborn transcribing these very long conservations with morrie and wondered how the hell he managed to create such a persistently thin and boring hallmark card like narrative these recordings hold what would have been a powerful intimate study of als dying friendships and social care instead we get thinly veiled tacky grieving porn i also couldnt get past one major point mitch did not give a damn about morrie until he saw his story on national television and learned of his ex professors plight throughout the book this exploitative money grabbing feel doesnt escape he knew instantly of the books potential market value the writing in particular because of the overly simplistic style at times seems to lacks genuine depth it feels standoff detached and clinical particularly to an experienced reader and sometimes when reading it feels like mitch is not entirely in the game  the way mitch narrates the story and the wisdom of morrie is very lacklustre here you have a professor conveying his life with hours worth of material to use and write about and mitch only seems capable of platitudes and unnecessary boring information that adds nothing to the real beef of the premise we hear meaningless and pointless mitch side quests which are remarkably uninteresting acting as pillow scenes to string together the meetings mitch and morrie had together we also get historical backlogs of morries life but these would have been more effectively communicated using his own words sometimes we hear about mitchs past and the intention is clearly to represent a symbiosis of experience as a reader we are meant to think wow here are two generations of men reflecting on their own life with death as the fat elephant in the room instead the situations mitch reflects on are incredibly bland like his memory with his brother avoiding the car in the snow who cares  just watch the nightline appearances mitch writes about in the text where morrie brims with wisdom that has been accrued from years of thinking a wisdom that mitch fails to channel see   as another goodreads reviewer put it  theres a common belief that the dying once terminal are imbued with a wisdom none of the rest of us can touch and if we would only pause at their feet to listen we could live out the rest of our lives with renewed vigour and purpose tuesdays with morrie takes this poisonous conceit and runs with it for  insufferable pages all the way to the bank  it is true that wisdom is not immediately bestowed to people once they are terminally ill or dying sometimes writing on death once the author knows they are dying is philosophically moving such as christopher hitchens text mortality which was incomplete when he died other writers like susan sontag wrote beautifully about their illnesses virginia woolf said that we rarely have illness as a common theme of literature it does not feature in the same way that love does i think the reason for that is despite love often having the same deleterious effects the black hole of death is something that does not shine back like the pond of narcissus it is the unknown country and that is a terrifying callous prospect that stultifies us into silence morrie to his credit was someone who decided to use his dying constructively to provide a physical portrait sociological at its heart of someone figuring out these existential conundrums of life in real time als as a disease also acts as a cruel frame by frame isolation of death itself body part by body part death comes in many forms and in morries case it was progressively working in slow motion  in one of the better descriptions in the book we get this description of als  als is like a lit candle it melts your nerves and leaves your body a pile of wax often it begins with the legs and works its way up you lose control of your thigh muscles so that you cannot support yourself standing you lose control of your trunk muscles so that you cannot sit up straight by the end if you are still alive you are breathing through a tube in a hole in your throat while your soul perfectly awake is imprisoned inside a limp husk perhaps able to blink or cluck a tongue like something from a science fiction movie the man frozen inside his own flesh this takes no more than five years from the day you contract the disease  what a terrifying prospect being trapped in your own sinking ship the sole upside of this book is that its popularity has meant that als as a disease became more widely known and understood well before the infamous ice bucket challenge meme that took over the internet in the summer of  morrie stands as a life lesson for people around him including his student accepting illness criticizing materialistic society valuing meaning those traits speaks of how strong he was it takes a huge effort to look for meaning in such shallow surroundings that what made me even more sad for him can someone tell me why this book is a big deal omg i wanted to pull my hair out so patronizing preachy and no offence to an ailing morrie boring ive read my share of uplifting books and some of them have had a profound effect on me  but this one is just not my type  or maybe im not in the right frame of mind to read something like this love is different love is when you are as concerned with someone elses situation as you are about your own  there is no such thing as too late in life  learn how to die and you learn how to live  nothing haunts us like the things we dont say  adding this one to the books i will reread every now and again full of good life lessons that i will carry with me throughout
"Winnie-the-Pooh (Winnie-the-Pooh, #1)",first of all this book is magic in my typical fashion i read this book using a technique called immersion reading listening to the audiobook while following along in a text version it was my lucky day because amazon gave me a free audio version of this who doesnt like free stuff the audio version was so wonderful the instrumental portions were so calming that it was as relaxing as yoga also it was an incredible experience hearing the songs and the various sound effects like the bees buzzing the physical copy was also a real treat the illustrations are really topnotch and very well done the book itself was really hilarious as well  how long does getting thin take asked pooh anxiously about a week i should think  thats right one week to be thin im lovin it i have actually met the real winniethepooh and his friends no for real when i was stopping by the new york public library they were on display in the childrens section you see christopher robin was a real boy and he had these stuffed animals aa milne is christopher robins father now if only i can get my father to write a bestselling immortal book about me  overall a heart warming funny book that still brings joy after nearly  years in which the animals meet a hostile reviewer and pooh invents a new breakfast  one morning pooh and piglet were walking through the hundred acre wood when they spied a strange creature lying on the ground as they got closer they could see that it looked a bit like a very large boy but what was most remarkable was that someone had tied it down with hundreds of tiny ropes it could hardly move a finger and there was even something tied over its mouth  mmf said the creature in a loud but rather stifled voice  oh pooh said piglet nervously do you think its a a heffalump  pooh walked around it carefully  no he said at last i dont think its a heffalump i think its a kind of woozle and its playing gulliverstravels  mmf said the creature again  you see said pooh i was right well if he is a swift fan i happen to have a little hum based on that wellknown piece a modest proposal which im sure he will like  he cleared his throat and was just about to start humming when who should turn up but christopher robin and rabbit  look christopher robin said pooh weve found a woozle and were playing gulliverstravels  christopher robin looked at the creature on the ground  silly old bear he said affectionately thats not a woozle thats a hostile reviewer rabbit i dont suppose you might know how he got here  well said rabbit modestly its possible that my friends and relations had something to do with it they were rather tired of certain comments they had seen on goodreads but i think we could remove that gag at least  the reviewer did indeed seem very hostile he glared at them for a while and then muttered something about one star and pouring sugar down your throat  oh yes said pooh eagerly youre right ive tried it many times and the sugar just gets into the tickliest places thats why i prefer honey and then he suddenly became very quiet because he had had a good idea  we need to do something said rabbit paying him no attention i have made a list of suggestions he took out a piece of paper  first we could ask tigger to bounce him  tigger doesnt always follow orders said christopher robin  second we could roll him in eeyores thistly patch  it would spoil the thistles said christopher robin  third we could ask owl to write an angry comment  im not sure said christopher robin that owls broadband connection is working after the recent blustery day  fourth we could play poohsticks with him i thought i would ask pooh now where is he he was here a few minutes ago  and indeed pooh was nowhere to be seen but a moment later they heard his voice and then he came around a tree carrying a large tray  look said pooh rather out of breath it suddenly came to me you melt the sugar and dip biscuits in it and then you wait for them to cool and spread them with honey and condensed milk kanga helped me im calling it hostile reviewers breakfast  ah yes said christopher robin thats what were going to do  so they untied the reviewer and they all sat down and ate hostile reviewers breakfast together until there was not a crumb left and the reviewers review was covered in sticky stars and everyone agreed that they had never eaten anything quite so delicious in all their lives some people care too much i think its called love  since winniethepooh is my favourite disney movie i decided to read book its based on turns out it is one of my favourite books it is so absolutely sweet and filled with smart humor what i like most about winniethepooh is this melancholic feeling you get while reading i just really really love it so much i will forever read this to my future children or dogs depends winniethepooh by aa milne was my favorite book series as a child later when my own kids sat listening to the adventures of christopher robin pooh bear piglet and eeyore and the gang it was a little bit of a shock to discover this series with its charming stories are not just for kids  a little consideration a little thought for others makes all the difference  i enjoyed sharing these stories with my own children loving the chance  or excuse to read them all over again struck by the humor and the clever rhymes and diversity of the characters this ode to childhood and friendship is poignant for the adults but has brought extreme joy to children for nearly a century which is a testament to their agelessness  spying this book at the library this past week i couldnt resist checking it out this time with my children grown and living their own lives i have no excuse to read these stories again but you know what you dont need a reason or excuse to read these classic delightful adventures winnie the pooh and his cohorts tug at the hearts of both young and old alike  what better way to spend a cold dreary day than with christopher robin and winnie the pooh being reminded of the many hours of joy they gave you and the great memories they bring back of special times spent reading these books to my own children  maybe the best thing though is seeing these diverse characters stand the test of time and feeling at peace knowing these special and gentle stories will continue to delight children and their parents for many more generations to come the winnie the pooh books are great because everyone has some sort of problem pooh is painfully nave piglet is neurotic owl is a narcissist eeyore has major depression tigger is hyperactive rabbit is a sociopath and kanga needs to spend an afternoon with the feminine mystique its good for kids to learn that pretty much anyone you meet will have some sort of major problem  what a beautiful stroll down memory lane  winnie the pooh is a classic and a personal favorite of mine i still have my stuffed winne the pooh that i had as a child and i have no idea how many times i watched the winniethepooh videos with my son when he was little needless to say when i saw this was offered as an audiobook i had to scoop it up  hats off to the narrator who i thought did an amazing job with the voices and bringing life to christopher robin winnie the pooh and all of a a milnes beloved characters my ears and heart were equally happy listening to this classic tale a wonderful bookaudio book for the young and the youngatheart  pooh fans will not be disappointed in fact i believe you will be as delighted as i was  thank you to dreamscape media and netgalley who provided me with a copy of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review all the thoughts and opinions are my own my children and grandchildren love winnie the pooh and i must admit so do i hes my favourite bear and there is so much wisdom in these books by aa milne the stories from my childhood never seem to age and are loved by many children today both big and small pure nostalgia  there is nothing i can say that does this book justice it is a work of art the word play is stupendous it is funny from start to finish it is perfect for both adults and kids although the lines and the vocabulary are actually better suited to adults it works exceedingly well for both by first entertaining and amusing the adults it pushes them to talk and explain to their kids what may be difficult for them to understand kids know when their parents are enjoying themselves and then they have fun too a totally enjoyable shared reading experience is the result i listened to this with my husband with not a child in sight and we both loved it from start to finish  we listened to the unabridged and unaltered audiobook version narrated by peter dennis it is the only version authorized by aa milnes son christopher robin the audiobook is performed with both talent and skill the intonations for each and every one of the characters are utterly perfect the background side effects are delightful as is the music softly played between chapters you must hear poohs songs the entire production cannot be improved upon  tell me what does it say about me that eeyore is and always has been my favorite of the nine friendschristopher robin pooh eeyore owl kanga and baby roo tiger piglet rabbit and his friends and relations i bet even now after perhaps many years having passed since you last read this you will still be able to easily recall each ones personality  this book gets better every time i read it next time you want to read it dont read it instead listen to it narrated by peter dennis and do it soon i guarantee you will not be disappointed  so you think this simply childs play it isnt  dear christopher robin your father and i miss you but we feel that it would be best if you spent the remainder of the summer at camp as previously agreed you quit the boy scouts band and your newspaper route to spend more time with those things really my son you are much too told to play with stuffed animals to think all my friends in the bridge meetings have allstar athlete sons and honor roll daughters to brag about i have christopher robin you may be a hero in your bedroom in the night but i have to make up things about you to boast about how you saved your friend e from getting lost in the woods or your friend w who flew into the tree tops on too many hot air balloons the tales are getting quite ridiculous you should make regular old human boy friends you arent gay are you your father thinks that maybe it is about time i have put up your toys for sale in a garage sale and a nice man named kurtz came to purchase them he gave me a very nice ivory musical instrument set in exchange for them i bragged for a month of bridge meetings about that coup well well see you at the end of the summer please at least try to get a tan your legs in those ridiculous little boy shorts are much too pale love mum dear christopher robin i have lost the passage of time at the bottom of this trunk i dont know where we are going only that i am scared lions and tigers and bears oh my oh dear tigger is not himself he is snarling at me winnie is off his pot and its not honey i i dont know how to tell you this by the time you read this i am not be a let of a pig myself they ate roo and rabbit kurtz is his name he eats he smells he ripped the heads off of monkeys and oh dear we are not in the  acre wood any more i fear so much that i shall become like eeyore who took his own life kanga had not a pep talk to pull out of her pouch for him wise old owl only advises that we must make do with our new great leader i have not forsaken you i tremble and i shake oh dear oh dear why must the fate of our world depend on my little shoulders help piglet dear mom and dad i hope that you have given up on finding me i was never the golden boy you wanted me to be only with my stuffed animal menagerie could i come off as wiser and smarter that i needed me to be a lot has happened since last year i ditched the canoes and the wedgies and bug juice for real bugs and canoes and wedgies you havent had a wedgie until the humidity lodges the whole elastic band up tight in your ass crack in the jungle and sweet sweet revenge you would have been in awe if you could have heard my summation in the end the sweet justification for my brutal actions it is the law of the jungle silly old bear i will kill kurtz and take his fiancee for myself no mom i am not gay his followers i had killed and stuffed now they worship me too love your son winner winnie the pooh winnie the pooh i grew up watching the cartoon and the movies on the magical world of disney i watched them so many times that i have them etched in my memory the accents of the characters and songs included my middle daughter although not a strong reader loves bears when she was younger my parents bought her the set of pooh books in an attempt to stimulate her reading her name is there on the inside cover in purple marker but i dont think anyone ever read them needing comfort reads on a rainy weekend  i decided to open the first book and visit the hundred acre woods for an hour i got to escape to the world of pooh piglet christopher robin and friends and forget about everything going on in the world that is what childhood favorites are all about  and i am so lucky to have this set of classics on my bookshelf so i can return to poohs world whenever i want so beautifully and so simply written deceptively so by aa milne and exquisitely illustrated by eh shepard initially blackwhite line drawings and later colour washed by shepard himself  these are the stories of a boy and his bear his world and all the wonderful characters that inhabit that world   acre wood his childhood and ultimately the passing of that childhood  what could have been especially considering the era in which they were written a particularly twee sickly sweet and very dated collection of stories of childhood is as about as far from that as it could possibly be both collections have certainly stood the test of time extremely well  at the heart of aa milnes wonderful collections winniethepooh and the house at pooh corner  is of course pooh who is such a wonderfully created character  a bear of very little brain but a bear who is undeniably wise funny loyal paradoxically clever who does many brave and wonderful things a bear who makes mistakes and gets things wrong but is always forgiven a bear who is both selfish and greedy see honey and yet kind and thoughtful a bear who above all else and clichd though it may be lovable  let us not forget though the lovely cast of supporting characters including the timid and excitable piglet wise although not owl morose and selfpitying eeyore kango roo rabbit and friends and relations and many others in these characters we see ourselves we all know and eeyore the same as we all know a rabbit  we are all in there somewhere in some shape or form  aa milnes winniethepooh stories are just so simply and so well written both collections are timeless classics  from the opening lines to the closing ones from the profoundly moving last chapter so they went off together but wherever they go and whatever happens to them on the way in that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing  there is so much more i could write about these books but it doesnt feel that i am really conveying quite how wonderful these stories are i am not doing them justice  what aa milne along with eh shepard have given us is something very special both of these collections are classics in every sense of the word  not to mention the funny moving and sometime life affirming quotes from winniethepooh  sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart rivers know this there is no hurry we shall get there some day if the person you are talking to doesnt appear to be listening be patient it may simply be that he has a small piece of fluff in his ear whenever i think of winniethepooh i think of an incredibly sweet melancholy like aa milne is not allowed to make me feel these feels in the form of a childrens story book  if you live to be a hundred i want to live to be a hundred minus one day so i never have to live without you  how lucky i am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard  promise me youll always remember youre braver than you believe and stronger than you seem and smarter than you think  you cant stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to come to you you have to go to them sometimes  weeds are flowers too once you get to know them  what day is it its today squeaked piglet my favorite day said pooh  see what i mean its so freakin sweet and as an adult you actually realize that aa milne is dishing out some pretty fantastic advice on life i urge everyone who hasnt already to get lost in the hundred acre wood because its thoughtful and seriously cute obviously i am giving  stars to my childhood  what a delightful experience this book has been  one of my most precious childhood memories and the reason why my love for these lovely characters started was spending a lot of my afternoons watching the tv adaptations of winniethepooh with my mother once and again and again until dinner time i also used to read an adapted booka book not illustrated by e h shepard having some disneyadaptation pictures insteadthat belonged to my elder brother and of course i owned a small collection of winniethepooh stuffed toys a water bottle a backpack clothes and so on and so forth in short i used to be a huge fan of winnie the pooh and his adventures way back when i was a little kid and perhaps those feelings are back now that i read the original text for the first time  this first volume is made up of ten partly separate short stories where each tale usually has a different main protagonist or a character whose story will be the main plot in every case for instance the first tale is a short introduction to my two favorite characters in the book pooh bear and christopher robin the second one has another character who is mainly involved in a particular situation and then they those characters who have been introduced to us until that moment will try to give a solution to that problem and so on besides every chapter has an accurate title which describes what we are about to read sometimes in a funny cheerful way  in addition milnes narrative is so easy yet quite enjoyable to read firstly because of the charming characters we have here and secondly because every tale has a wholesome feelgood storyplot i also enjoyed the fact that there are poems and songs inside the stories which besides made them be more colorful and engaging lastly i must confess that i loved catching up with pooh piglet eeyore rabbit kanga roo owl and christopher robin after so many years i guess its called nostalgia needless to say id highly recommend this book but just in case it was not clear i would wholeheartedly recommend this book to every single person in the world children or grownups  tracks said piglet pawmarks he gave a little squeak of excitement oh pooh do you think its aaa woozle it may be said pooh sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt you never can tell with pawmarks its tough to read something this perfect and pure without feeling a bit like miltons satan dismayed by just how far from true innocence and grace ive fallen winniethepooh by aa milne ernest h shepard decorations  pooh said rabbit kindly you havent any brain i know said pooh humbly  it is hard to be brave said piglet sniffing slightly when youre only a very small animal  very small animal indeed  just like the rest of us believe it or not i had never read this book before while scanning friends reviews i came across this book several times and decided i needed to experience it since ive gone all these years without  pure joy just loved the illustrations too its a nice day  i live adjacent to a conservation area  perhaps ill explore my own hundred acre woods  recommended for children of all ages any book that gets my kids to be quiet during a long car ride gets a  star rating from me the fact that it makes me chuckle here and there is a plus silly old pooh  winnie the pooh is like a rite of passage to many and yet despite watching the tv and movie adaptations i have never read or been read this book fortunately this holds equal appeal to both child and adult readers alike much due to the ironically humorous style and the silly anecdotes of the adorable cast of animals who grace these pages this was a quick read but an unforgettable one a full five stars from this adult reader who can only wish she read this two decades ago as well oh bother ive started this review and now i dont know how to continue i had a very good idea for one and then it sort of just flew away whats a revue asked piglet can they really fly well they can said bear it depends sometimes they just plod if you know what i mean you have to say something of very great importance so that it will be liked pooh said piglet helpfully if you wrote it i would like it anyway  but maybe there isnt anything new i can say that hasnt been said already for the bear of very little brain aa milnes not the vomitoriously cute disney pooh is a wonderful and timeless creation who could not love such a dim but loyal friend who could not fail to identify in some way with at least one of poohs own meek credulous testy pompous or depressed you know who i mean friends well one granddaughter didnt take to him at all but the other would have listened to both this and the house at pooh corner at one sitting if she had been able to  theres no accounting for taste i remember reading these at maybe  or so and being full of sadness when i at last finished the second book because i had never wanted that world to end a really wonderful collection of short tales that introduces the friends of christopher robin from that silly little bear who is fixated on honey to the nervous piglet  i was quite surprised that tigger doesnt feature he appears in the sequel i was familiar with most of these stories having grown up with the disney cartoons pooh getting stuck in holes being so iconic this book also included some wonderful illustrations  my favourite character is eeyore i loved hes birthday storyline precious beyond compare  completed the audiobook this year  its tough stuff to take after a lifetime raised on disney voices winniethepooh the world favourite tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff and willy nilly silly old bear ive been reading these books since i was a child and i never get bored of them i bought this book in a collection of  whilst i was in krakow a few weeks ago and felt like a child on christmas i was so excited winniethepooh stories are great no matter what age you are and i would recommend them to anyone if you havent read them yet youre absolutely missing out this is the most wholesome book i have ever read  i cannot even begin to express how much i loved this book even though i didnt expect to  winniethepooh wasnt a huge part of my childhood sure ive had stuffed toys coloring books and seen movies and shows of it but they were never my favorite and i never quite connected with them having been intrigued however by the films christopher robin and goodbye christopher robin i decided to read the book where edward bear had his conception  this is a collection of short stories that were all loosely connected and they were all heartwarming lighthearted and oddly comforting and nostalgic very much like antoine de saintsexuperys the little prince winniethepooh is a love letter to childhood innocence and the perhaps notsobad bliss of naivet as it is so i imagine even adults enjoying poohs adventures if they ever find themselves longing for those things  winniethepooh is a book to read when you need a little break from the busyness of the world and life in general highly recommended celebrity deathmatch review in which winnie the pooh wins    i know some here think i am unnecessarily wordy so let me get straight to the point hamlet sucks  editors note to these recently discovered papers tolstoy tries really really hard to leave it at that but he cant and thus tolstoy continues  as i wrote some time ago now  none of shakespeares characters shows in such a striking fashion the playwrights  i dont want to say inabilitycomplete disregard for proper characterization as does hamlet none of his other plays reveals as much as hamlet the blind worship of shakespeare the unreasoning hypnosis which does not even admit the thought that a work of shakespeares can be anything but brilliant or that one of his main characters can be anything but the expression of some new deeply involved idea  shakespeare takes a reasonably good story or drama written some  years earlier writes his own play from it putting into the mouth of the principal character quite inopportunely as he always does all those ideas of his own which he thinks worthy of consideration but in doing so  he is totally unconcerned about when and under what circumstances these ideas are uttered thus the character who expresses all these ideas becomes shakespeares mouthpiece and loses his own essence to the extent that his deeds do not correspond to his words  hamlets personality is quite understandable in the story from which shakespeare drew his play he is outraged by his uncles and mothers deed wants to take vengeance on them but is afraid his uncle might kill him as he did his father and therefore feigns insanity   all this is clear and it follows from hamlets character and position but by putting into hamlets mouth those ideas which shakespeare wants to tell the world and by forcing him to perform those actions which shakespeare needs for preparing the most effective scenes the author destroys the character of the hamlet of the legend for the entire duration of the play hamlet does not act the way he might want or might like to but the way the author requires him to act at one time he is terrorized by his fathers ghost and another time he chaffs at him calling him an old mole first he loves ophelia later he teases her cruelly and so forth it is impossible to find an explanation for hamlets actions or words and it is therefore impossible to assign to him any character at all  but since it is generally accepted that the great shakespeare could not possibly write anything bad scholars and critics have racked and are racking their brains to discover some unusual beauty in an obvious defect which is particularly evident and quite irritating in hamlet where the protagonist has no character the wise critics now proclaim that hamlet expresses with extraordinary power a completely new and profound character whose distinguishing feature is the absence of character and that only the genius of a shakespeare could create such a profound characterless character having established this the scholarly critics proceed to write volume upon volume to praise and explain the greatness and significance of the characterization of a person without character it is true that some of the critics occasionally produce timid remarks that there might be something odd about that character that hamlet is an unsolvable riddle but no one finds the courage to say that the emperor is naked that it is perfectly plain that shakespeare was either unable or unwilling to give hamlet a specific character nor did he understand that it was at all necessary and so the scholarly critics continue to study investigate and extol this mysterious literary production   to this i will now add the moralistic ascetic winnie  the christfigure as small bear  this is what hamlet should have been instead of the pathetic ditherer he turned out to be hamlet pah upon seeing my fivestar rating of winniethepooh via my facebook feed my sister made the following comment the originals were depressing i prefer disneys cuddly version i made the following response which i think sums up my feelings about this wonderful classic childrens book  one day pooh and piglet were walking through the hundred acre wood when they came upon a facebook comment the originals were depressing it read i prefer disneys cuddly version  thththats a vvvery bbbig statement to mmmake piglet stammered slightly nervous that there existed somewhere else in the hundred acre wood a disney version of himself  pooh thought for a moment if it is a big statement then a big person must have made it perhaps it was a heffelump  or a woozle said eeyore walking from behind the facebook comment  oh hello eeyore said pooh  i dont know whats so depressing about this place eeyore replied ignoring poohs cheerful greeting always seems a little too cheerful for me  perhaps we should go ask christopher robin about who made the big facebook comment said pooh after a thoughtful moment  silly old bear said christopher robin after being presented with the problem it wasnt a heffelump nor a woozle it was the sister of the writer  pooh and his friends looked toward the page oh hello said pooh piglet peaked out from behind his fluffy friend  now let us go inside and i shall read you a story said christopher robin  and might i have just a smackerel of your storytime hunny christopher asked pooh trying to speak louder than the grumbling in his stomach  silly old bear said christopher robin as he led his friends into the house for a story   and that is why the books will always be better than the disney versions like pretty much everyone else in the world id heard of winniethepooh id even seen a lot of the tv shows and movies a friend of mine actually wrote some of the tv shows for disney but it wasnt until i watched goodbye christopher robin that i became interested in reading the books i am so very glad i did celebrity death match review in which hamlet and winnie demonstrate their people skills in a job interview at a secondhand car lot   who would you buy a used car from i love it and i will always there is no better book not only for children  i have been listening to peter dennis narration  audible gives temporarily free access to some titles i recommend it  he read wonderfully
"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",i refuse to write a review for one of the best books ever written asking a serious fantasy fan to write a review for lord of the rings is like asking a christian to write a review for the bible im not going to write a normal review its almost impossible for a fantasy fan to do so in this case instead im going to give you a series of ten points to explain exactly why i love this particular book take from it what you will there will be spoilers here goes   the wizards  do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger  now i do love wizards who doesnt the wisdom of gandalf is unmatched he is in effect the leader of the forces of light he is the commander in chief the battle general and the tactician he organises everything from aragorns coming to the hobbits bearing the ring gandalf is behind it all he has walked middle earth for thousands of years he has seen it all and he understands the perilous nature of the quest better than most he is the grand optimist the man who sees the best in people he should have been the leader of the isatri he was the most pure he is nothing like the changeable leader of his order  description  contrastingly saruman is the realist he is neither light nor dark but a being who can adapt to the circumstance he saw only defeat for man so he turned his cloak and helped to usher in the doom of middle earth his mind was poisoned by the palantir sauron fed of his ambition and bent him to his will something saruman didnt fully conceive he considered himself the equal of sauron in reality if sauron had regained the ring he would have crushed saruman like a bug and if saruman had gained the ring first things would have become much different it would have been a war between the two one that would have unforeseen circumstances   a desperate quest  the quest itself the sending of just nine people to destroy the conduit of darkness speaks of desperation the elves are not what they once were in the first age their power has diminished their people are leaving these lands they do not have the power to stand against the tide the dwarves are shattered and broken their leadership in erabor has their own problems to deal with they too face invasion and men men are weak well at least according to elrond so sending of a small party of mighty heroes and a few untested hobbits is a back door attempt of destroying the evil that infests middle earth and i love it have you ever read about a quest so unlikely and so improbable  i will take the ring he said though i do not know the way  description   a hidden king  other than the obvious wizard the agile elvish prince the stalwart dwarf lord the fellowship has a secret weapon aragorn the heir to isildur has finally come forth  all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost  from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king  he alone has the power to unite the failing world of men only he can save the white tree of gondor and insure that men do not fall into darkness and the darkness it genuinely fears him he is the last hope of men he is their salvation his ancient ancestor isildur struck the ring from the hand of evil thus sauron fears his coming however he is more powerful than isildur he has lived amongst the elves and he has learnt how his ancestor failed to crush the darkness in his vain weakness aragorn will not make the same mistake he will do better  description  loyalty  the party itself the fellowship of the ring are bound together with a mutual goal but its more than that they are dependent on each other each has skills the others could never possess and each brings with him the hope of a people simply put these heroes cannot fail middle earth depends on them they are the best of their races the most representative of their cultures and their participation speaks of a will to conquer the shadow that approaches it speaks of commitment  description  finding your courage  not all the party have been fully tested with them travel four young hobbits the most unlikely of companions for such a journey they are the overlooked the forgotten about the race that is casually discarded and considered insignificant in the wider world and perhaps this has been the downfall of society in middle earth previously the forces of darkness exploit everything they can get their hands on from giant spiders to rampaging trolls from dragons to orcs from men of the east to the undead sauron tries to wield it all this is something the forces of good have not fully considered until recently within the bosom of the hobbit beats a strong heart of fortitude and resilience  my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf hobbits really are amazing creatures as i have said before you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch  they carry with them the key to destroying the dark bilbo showed them how he could resist the ring the hobbits are an almost incorruptible race and because of this they are saurons doom it is something he has overlooked  it would be the death of you to come with me sam said frodo and i could not have borne that  not as certain as being left behind said sam  but i am going to mordor  i know that well enough mr frodo of course you are and im coming with you  description  the rich history  middle earth didnt pop up overnight this word has been around for thousands of years such can be seen from the ruined statues and monuments that dot the landscape to mentions of historic battles and finally to kings long since departed this is a world that has seen a lot this moment in the third age which is arguable the most important series of events this world will ever see is merely the surface go read the silmarillion go see how old and beautiful this world is i could lose myself in middleearth and this book carries with it all the baggage of what came before its extraordinary  description  the diverse languages and races  and with this history comes the language of the people the elves the men the dwarves and saurons creatures of darkness all come with their own developed languages this isnt some random phrases stuck in the book which you may see with other fantasy novels but actually fully developed languages they have their own grammatical forms syntax styles and sound qualities that reflect the speaker the languages are real naturally the elvish language is a personal favourite of mine  description  the power of redemption  it is easy to judge boromir of gondor he tried to take the ring from frodo though for all his misguidedness he was trying to do right by his people he naively believed due to his farther denethor that the ring could be wielded against the evil so when a young hobbit is trying to destroy his peoples supposed salvation he strikesuntil that moment he doesnt fully understand the evil it holds until his desire for it twists his heart and turns him violent but afterwards after he sees what he has become his willpower does prevail he understands he later dies defending the fellowship of the ring a bloody end but one that saves his honour  description   the forces of darkness  one evil binds them all sauron tried to make himself the ultimate tyrant and claim dominion over all lands he wanted to be the de facto ruler of middle earth he failed those that followed his initial claim are forever left in the dark their souls are black their hearts corrupt their bodies no more the nazgul have become the living dead they are complex figure driven by hate and a will no longer their own these men have become something else do they wish to rest i do not know do they wish to carry out their masters work or are they driven by his domination i do not know orcs are mere tools for the darkness the nazgul are something much darker they are the perfect harbingers of their lord  description   the elves  the elves are my favourite part of middle earth i should have been born an elf i would love to spend a few years in rivendell especially in elronds library relaxing by the waterfalls reading the histories of middle earth doesnt that just sound like so much fun the best thing about reading fantasy like this is the pure escapism it provides the worse thing is realising how shit the real world is in comparison  description  to quote another fine author of fantasy and to conclude this review i will simply repeat these words founding a genre like a boss  stealing everything possible from mythology and the maybe sometimes a tiny bit boring old classics the beloved tradition of using others ideas to create something new is big here especially because tolkien had the perfect background to milk everything from wherever he could find inspirations from ancient to medieval and at the time modern works it would especially be interesting to read or reread lotr with a focus on how he let the classics mutate to new forms transformed oldfashioned tropes to fit for a modern audience and especially made it a compelling well written and suspenseful pageturner dont be angry good old classics its not your fault your poor creators just had no creative writing courses available or were hunted by the inquisition or it were total monopolies to that their works were the only ones available and thereby never cared about royalties book signing tours or target audiences  black white and the most important grey the pure camouflages fascistic evil is of course as noir as possible but especially the sexy seductiveness of the mind penetrating psi magic of the distilled badassery is one of the main driving engines of the groundbreaking epic journey because good old almightiness totally corrupts its just normal that everyone is struggling with the whispering of the dark side with all its attractive options and the real life implications of this are well terrible frustrating and daunting throw money at close to everyone and shehe will get corrupted especially if the alternative is to get eaten by orcs while the family is raped by uruk hais and balrogs  establishing cliffhangery ends of single parts one just cant stop this damn evil tendency of the genre to stop at the most suspenseful part and let the reader hanging to wait for felt eternities as if sauron wasnt bad enough this vicious cycle continues with each new far too multi k page series and eats away the lives of poor innocent humans not to speak of their tormented souls that cant find peace over these nauseating periods of despair and regret to have been relapsing again im not sure if tolkien should be praised or damned for having laid the foundations for things like sandersons jordans eriksons etc amazingly exhausting and immersive monster series im ashamed to admit it but i have the whole good old second hand paperback wheel of time series and the new ones lying around and i am afraid to restart reading the whole thing not just the first few parts like a few years ago because i fear that it could trigger reading and rereading other series and finally wheel of time again until  or something not just having lost contact to reality not much difference to the present reality   but much more problematic to all other genres for half a decade or something thanks for that jrr  being attacked by the bigoted academic society of the time thats just ridiculous tolkien had to hide and vindicate his amazing work because it wasnt highbrow enough for his snobbish elitist and old boring so called quality literature prone colleagues and a bigoted conservative society that wasnt ready for something new better stay with theater texts as books or whatever can be used for patriotic our writer idiocy just bad luck that there arent enough good if any old writers for each country to fuel feelings of literary supremacy however its one more of these examples of how parochial even seemingly well educated and sophisticated people can be as soon as it comes to close to their cognitive dissonances and socioeconomic status hierarchy overkill  putting in meta connotations and social criticism tolkien was heavily influenced and inspired by war and the atrocities humans so much love to do to each other until nasty nukes eliminated the option of more ww action and put the real life implications everywhere in his work not just in the form of the big bad government cooperating with war industry propaganda machines and black magic but with  corrupted blood the banality of evil the attractiveness of the dark side is as mentioned in black white and above is one of the driving forces of the saga and without tolkiensexperiences it might have stayed much more superficial and have never reached that deep level of human soul and psyche vivisection the same with love without his lifelong deep bound to this adored wife he wasnt allowed to see until reaching full age the importance of emotions maybe wouldnt have unfolded and played such an essential role in the work expanding this whole philosophical psychological somewhat assumptions to his profession as a philologist and for the standards of the time mad professor would go a bit too far but lets just say that his expertise might have helped him create both silmarillion and lord of the rings  is it outdated very objective thing even if not including the sociocultural immense literary impact tolkien invested a bit more than the usual fantasy writer in herhis third or fourth series with a new one each new year just take the mentioned silmarillion the immense details of the world all the links to the cultural heritage and the sheer scale and size and on top of that close to everyone agrees that its a timeless genre founding ingenious masterpiece that will stand the test of not just time but eternity sure its not as accessible as the average new overhyped world bestseller but thats the same as with lem lovecraft etc authors just were used to write in that wacky overcomplicated intricate and difficult to digest language because they were no narcissistic lazy self aggrandizing god complexed hedonists i wont excuse for that im one myself and have n word privileges   comparing and contrasting fantasy with other genres horror scifi or crime had no similar big bangs fringe theory by the way to provoke and insult even more additional people than with just the human degeneration gag above lol but different founders prodigies and subgenres while fantasy was stayed and will be very genre compliant not to say a bit inflexible in contrast to other genres with much vaster differences especially sci fi my bread and peanut butter so one could say that close to every no matter if grimdark ya high epic romantic etc fantasy is always quite the same with some variations of magic systems the balance of focus on protagonists or antagonists tone and the rare establishment of the one or other sub sub genre  the endless evolution close to all human mythology faith myths etc is fantasy and i see one of its biggest potentials in a fusion to science fantasy because it opens up all options including any horror or psychothriller crime plot without tolkien this amazing development couldnt have taken place so soon and it would have probably needed much longer to establish the im a scifi head sorry second best genre to subjugate and enslave them all a review of lord of the rings fellowship of the ring by sauron  hello you may remember me as the title character of the lord of rings i go by a lot of names dark lord of mordor sorcerer red eye dark power lord of baraddr ringmaker and base master of treachery i use that one in my band i actually object to tolkiens chosen name of sauron which i understand originates from an adjective that means foul putrid in his crappy invented language what can i say the showers in mordor are sketchy at best on weekends my poker buddies call me sauron the destroyer of nacho platters  because tolkien intentionally failed to give a proper description of me in his books allow me to give you an idea i have a bit of a dark look my quest for world domination having been thwarted i watch a lot of tv these days my body is roughly equivalent to the the situation on jersey shore oh no i dont watch that but the witchking of angmar is obsessed he wont shut up about snowcone or some bimbo on that show im missing a finger which while preventing me from raining down carnage on middle earth allows me to collect decent ei plus the best lawyer in mordor got me covered under the dismemberment clause on my insurance so im riding the double dip gravy train much has been written about my terrible lidless red eye blah blah blah it freaked out that little twat frodo pretty good ill have you know that conjunctivitis is no laughing matter having to keep it open  to look for hoodlums skulking around mordor is murder on my hydration the nazgul have enough lift and aim to get up there to toss a bucket of visine at it but its just temporary relief regardless im still more of a looker than your precious king elessar or aragorn or whatever hes calling himself these days hes never met a brooding look he didnt like buy a razor get a real job  someone sent me peter jacksons movies in the mail the package had no return address but it was postmarked hobbiton where ever the hell that is as i watch these movies over and over i never even finished the books i was reminded of all my mistakes  perhaps a ring was not a good choice some buddies have suggested that maybe i shouldnt have tied all of my terrible powers to something as easy to misplace as the one ring in retrospect i should have forged the one gas station bathroom key chain of power it would have been a lot harder to tief i even could have pimped it out by making it from an ent branch or sarumans foot for all the good that old fart did me maybe a ring would have been just fine if it had been a toe ring then it wouldnt glow in the dark like a target for every freaking man on the battlefield i heard that the guy who beat me was named isildur wtf maybe i could have worn tougher gloves i dont know perhaps the door to the fires of mount doom should have had a better lock adt could have hooked me up with motion detectors but i hear that even cats can set those off they claim they can calibrate them but im not so sure the urukhai are always jumping up on the table so they would set it off for sure maybe just the alarm that goes off if something hits the lava like pool alarms for kid although i guess it would have been too late by then my preccciioouussss learn some balance ahole  frodo that little prick id rather not discuss how my quest for utter dominion was defeated by something i could poop out unnoticed  im getting off track im supposed to discuss the events of the first book the fellowship of the ring good times i was on a comeback then the withered up senior citizen gandalf had to go to the library and do a little research and figure out that my ring was not some cracker jack prize my ringwraiths tried to track down the ring but apparently taking it away from children was too difficult if i had put the nazgl on fell beasts rather than bloody horses from the start i might have tracked down frodo prick and his three buddies in the bloody woods dont horses have a good sense of smell anyways the fell beasts would have at least avoided drowning in a river sweet mary then those elves suggest a damn fellowship could you have come up with a lamer group name why not call it the loose association of people who share common beliefs or activitiesof the ring that balrog almost did me the biggest favour he was always one of my peeps you shall not pass what a line gandy how cow i heard that one took like  takes because pippin kept making everyone laugh by adding in the word gas fool of a took  anyways by the end of the fellowship of the ring i still had a fighting chance great book anyways the two towers wont be as fun to review sht hits the fan book  from  books  the fellowship of the ring the lord of the rings  jrr john ronald reuel tolkien  the fellowship of the ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel the lord of the rings by the english author j r r tolkien  it is followed by the two towers and the return of the king  the fellowship of the ring is the first volume of john ronald reuel tolkiens threevolume novel the lord of the rings an epic novel set in the fictional world of middleearth  the title lord of the rings actually refers to a creature called sauron or lord of darkness who long ago lost the only ring on which most of his power depends he does his best to find the ring again and use it to capture all the inhabitants of middleearth  ahhh this was amazing why did i not read this sooner its just beyond me  the world building is so rich so immersive so detailed its so easy to get lost in it yes the pacing is slower than what i expected it to be but it still continued to keep me interested  i love the characters especially and obviously aragorn hes just written so perfectly i might need some more time to warm up to frodo tho i preferred the movie version of him  idk why i thought the book was not going to end on a cliffhanger  but cant wait to read the next one i see why the books are so hyped    just watched the movies with my girl leonie now have got to read the series as well cause am obsessed and need more of itand aragorn raise your hand if you remember the awesome book fairs or scholastic book order forms from back when you were a kid well in middle school i picked up this sweet read in a box set with the rest of the trilogy and the hobbit unfortunately while i have always been enthusiastic about reading i did not find the motivation to complete it for almost  years  in the early s i read the hobbit then i followed it up by starting this one but lost interest shortly after tom bombadil tolkien is great but can be a bit much for a middle schooler even when i finally did finish it around  just in time for the movie it was still a bit of a labor of love  in the end though  no doubt  stars all the way this is a classic this is one of the grandfathers of high fantasy  i doubt you can find a single fantasy author that was not influenced by this bookseries even if you find some of the parts slow battle your way through i guarantee you wont regret it sing hey for the bath at close of day that washes the weary mud away a loon is he that will not sing o water hot is a noble thing  you shouldnt listen to all you hear  when i first watched lotr tfotr a movie that is around  hours long i thought the movie to be insanely long but now that ive finally gotten around to reading the book im shocked that the movie did manage to fit at least half of the contents of the book in to that three hour run for this is one long and eventful story with so much more information  advice is a dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise  tolkien was never one to have any kind of limitations when it came to vivid imagination this is something that he shared with the hobbit and it seemed to me that the style had indeed improved further i liked the plot of this one more that the hobbit though the surroundings in hobbits were much cozy in my opinion  i hope butterbur sends this promptly a worthy man but his memory is like a lumberroom things wanted always buried  but as for the plot it can hardly get any better than this one of the most well narrated stories ive ever read despite the books length it is hard to find a place to take a pause this is that eventful and such a thrill to read and the ending i think the chapters themselves wrapped up better compared to that ending which came out of nowhere its almost as if the author wanted you to pick the next one right away i feel sorry for the people who read the book when it was published in  and had to wait a few months to read the next  all that is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the old that is strong does not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be the blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king one of the great works of th century literature i first tried this in high school but was not able to get through on the first try the second try in my early s was the charm frodo goes on a quest that take in issues of morality friendship ones responsibility towards others facing ones fears courage danger while depicting a global battle between good and evil tolkien puts a human or hobbitish face on that conflict his themes are universal and his characters are very accessible frodo sam and gandalf are heroes for the ages and gollum is what can happen when normal is corrupted by darkness this is my favorite series and taken together with the succeeding pair my favorite book of all time i have read it at least five times including aloud to my children i hope to read it five more  november    lithub  how ian mckellen almost didnt play gandalf  by garry oconnor what can i say besides that rereading tolkiens masterwork after so many years is just as full of wonder and inspiration as it was  years ago when i was a young man learning the ways of this old world the fellowship of an elf a dwarf two men and four hobbits is such a incredibly beautiful tale of adventure and friendship and i savored every page while looking over my shoulder for wargs and balrogs and hiding my head from the eye of sauron so many images so many memories  the fellowship of the ring takes us on another journey with hobbits  this time bilbos nephew frodo his servant and best friend samwise and their friends merry and pippin it is in a sense a reverse epic journey because rather than traveling towards accomplishing something new they are traveling in order to destroy something old  the one ring they are sent on this fabulous journey by gandalf the eternal symbol of wisdom and strength in an aged wizard always with surprising talents and unsounded depths frodo saw him to the door he gave a final wave of his hand and walked off at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusual almost as if he was carrying a great weight the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight p   one of the things that makes the work so timeless universal and endearing is how gandalf while pushing the hobbits towards selfrealization via the quest does not give them all the pieces of the puzzle does not warn them of all the dangers they will face does not in fact coddle them he like an ideal parental figure gives them principles and goals and lets frodoco figure out how to accomplish them on their own thus they meet black riders and need to learn about them first hand and ultimately will defend themselves against them  the next major character they meet is strider who will later be revealed as aragorn he inspires wonder and mystery and helps the hobbits during their initial voyage to rivendell during which frodo has his first brush with death on weathertop they built a great watchtower on weathertop amon sl they called it it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head p  i have unfortunately never visited stonehenge but the description reminds me of the photos i have seen of the site  frodo is saved by his friends and brought back to health by the elves at rivendell a place of dreamsalmost it seemed that the words took shape and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world p  there are many passages such as this one where tolkien gives us a magic vision of shards of paradise  once he is fully recovered a large council is called to discuss the happenings in middle earth and formulate a plan to fight to lurking evil that is casting its growing shadow across the land we learn that the danger is twofold saruman the white has risen in power and decided to throw his fate in with sauron the evil one gandalf tells the council of his meeting with saruman where he tries to recruit gandalf to the dark side but fails i looked and then and saw that his robes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered i liked white better gandalf said white he sneered it serves only as a beginning white cloth may be dyed the white page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken in which case it is no longer white said gandalf and he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom  the elder days are gone the middle days are passing the younger days are beginning the time of the elves is over but our time is at hand the world of men which we must rule p  saruman sees correctly that the epoque of fairy tales and elves and childhood of the world in a sense is ending and a harsher time is coming and wants to take supreme power over the change gandalf points out that breaking things is not the best way to gain wisdom and refuses for gandalf wisdom is an entirely different thing it is not despair for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt we do not it is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courses have been weighed though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope well let folly be our cloak a veil before the eyes of the enemy p  and thus it is decided to create the fellowship of the ring and have the seven companions make their way west to east ultimately to mordor to destroy the ring it is interesting to note that tolkien rejects fatalism and seeks the unexpected in order to keep hope alive which points to the authors deep catholic belief system  the company sets out and are blocked at passing over the mountains and must use old tunnels underneath them into the old lost dwarf kingdom thus we come to the first great combat of the trilogy  the epic fight between dorins bain the balrog and gandalf it is not very precisely described but the balrog must be somewhat similar to smaug in appearance but in a far worse mood gandalf breaks the bridge they were fleeing throwing the balrog into the abyss with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its shadow plunged down and vanished but even then as it fell it swung its whip and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink he staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slide into the abyss fly you fools he cried and was gone p  the company is crushed by the seeming loss of gandalf he will not appear again for a long time and this loss will soon precipitate a splintering in the group  the group then reaches the elven tree village of lothlorien where the lovely galadriel will entertain them here we get another taste of tolkiens deep love of nature as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it he felt a delight in wood and the touch of it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the delight of the living tree itself p  i loved this passage as it seems to prefigure the ecological movement that has been written of in recent years most notably in richard powers wonderful the overstory  while in lothlorien lady galadriel turns out to bear one of the three rings of power one of the others having been lost in the dwarf kingdom under the mountain and the other worn by gandalf and is offered the ring that binds them all by frodo but after looking into a famous mirror inspiration for dumbledores pensive of course and being suddenly transformed into a formidable figure of power and beauty she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken a slender elfwoman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad p  we will meet another very strong but very human heroine in the return of the king but galadriel will ultimately fade into history already she seemed to frodo as by men of later days elves still at time were seen present and yet remote a living vision of what which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of time p  this idea of elves being somewhat beyond time and using the river metaphor is classic tolkien and plays on his image of the elves as being ancestors of the people who existed in england before
Slaughterhouse-Five,i have to admit to being somewhat baffled by the acclaim slaughterhouse has received over the years sure the story is interesting it has a fascinating and mostly successful blend of tragedy and comic relief and yes i guess the fractured structure and timetravelling element must have been quite novel and original back in the day but that doesnt excuse the books flaws of which there are a great many in my seemingly unconventional opinion take for instance vonneguts endless repetition of the phrase so it goes wikipedia informs me it crops up  times in the book it felt like three hundred times to me about forty pages into the book i was so fed up with the words so it goes that i felt like hurling the book across the room something i have not done since trying to read up on french semiotics back in the s i got used to coming across the words every two pages or so eventually but i never grew to like them god no  i found some other nits to pick too some of them were small and trivial and frankly rather ridiculous such as  wait for it  the hyphen in the books title seriously what is that hyphen doing there theres no need for a hyphen there couldnt someone have removed it like  editions ago and while im at it couldnt some discerning editor have done something about the monotonous quality of vonneguts prose  about the interminable repetition of short subjectverbobject sentences dont get me wrong im not saying all authors should use henry james or claire messudlength sentences heaven forbid im actually rather fond of minimalism both in visual art and in writing but vonneguts prose is so sparse and simplistic its monotonous rather than minimalist to the point where i frequently found myself wishing for a runon sentence every now and then or for an actual indepth description of something i hardly ever got either as a result there were times when i felt like i was reading a barebones outline of a story rather than the story itself granted it was an interesting outline larded with pleasing ideas and observations but still i think the story could have been told in a more effective way a less annoying way too  as for the plot i liked it i liked the little vignettes vonnegut came up with and the colourful characters he created the british officers being my particular favourites i liked the fact that youre never quite sure whether billy is suffering from dementia brain damage or some kind of delayed posttraumatic stress disorder or whether there is some actual timetravelling going on i even liked the jarring switches in perspective although i think they could have been handled in a slightly more subtle manner and i liked the books antiwar message weak and defeatist though it seemed to be in short i liked the book but it took some doing i hope ill be less annoyed by the two other vonnegut books i have sitting on my shelves breakfast of champions and cats cradle here it is yet another book that i didnt read in school but decided to pick up later in life and i think this is one of the rare instances where i think i would have benefited from some educational instruction to supplement my reading because i did not seem to get this on my own  i mean on a surface level i understood the antiwar tones and commentary on society in general but anything deeper than that eluded me so taking this at face value i think its safe to say this is a really weird book lol  also i wasnt really a fan at how women were portrayed in this they were always noted as being ugly or dull or only good for sex and i know many people might say thats vonneguts signature satire but it definitely rubbed me the wrong way  overall i get that this story evokes much needed discussion on several important issues however this didnt impact me as significantly as it was probably meant to so it goes a stunning piece of sciencefiction audaciously centred around the allied fire bombing of dresden at the end of world war ii slaughterhouse five tells the story of billy pilgrim as he time travels back and forth within his own lifetime a life forever marked and tainted by his experience of being a pow and then being stationed in dresden at the time of the fire bombing a postmodern metafictional satirical novel that has often been censored especially in the united states for being seen to be so laid back about homosexuality and being perceived as being disrespectful to american soldiery a true modern classic  out of  i was eating a hotdog right after reading slaughterhousefive and as i was contemplating on what to write for my review i was suddenly attacked by a bunch of threeheaded toads they called themselves the threeheaded toads and they wore mexican sombreros and nickelback tshirts they were roughly the size of peter dinklage and were colored from neon pink to dark orange for some unknown reason their leader named pedro the pope decided to declare war on hotdog eating humans i was tragically their first victim i wet my pants as the toad named lollipop susanna tried to poke me with a rusty swissknife pedro the pope saw in my hand slaughterhousefive he read it from covertocover in about  seconds threeheaded toads read very fast surprisingly it was the only fast thing they could do they read lots of books and somewhere along one of those books they read that hotdogs caused globalwarming they despised hotdogs so it goes  after reading slaughterhousefive pedro the pope decided that he didnt like wars anymore he now despised wars more than hotdogs he was very easy to convince hankydoodle the neon pink toad with a disposable spork on his hand suddenly burst out with random shrieks of snakes are noodlepussies snakes are noodlepussies he was not right in the heads i was mortified i wet my pants again so it goes  pedro the pope then asked me if whether or not i knew where tralfamadore was threeheaded toads did not understand the concept of fiction i decided to point him in the general direction of my toilet i said there was a portal there and that all they needed to do was to flush away after a few moments i heard some serious flushing the last thing i heard was ribbit so it goes  i waited a few moments to make sure that they werent there anymore when i came in i saw something written using lipstick on my toilet  warz r nut kool  i wet my pants with a steady stream of urine joy i read this book over  years ago but i only just realized that montana wildhack the porn star with whom billy pilgrim shares a cage in the zoo on tralfamadore is played in the movie version by valerie perrine who was also lex luthors girlfriend in superman and saved the world by removing christopher reeves kryptonite necklace so he didnt drown in the swimming pool  busy busy busy never was keen on the idea of taking something as important as the secondworldwar and throwing in time travel but its a book that came along by chance and i thought at least give it a go no doubt kurt vonnegut had the greatest of intentions to write an antiwar novel which he clearly has done but it just never really struck me as anything that particularly special its driven by his own dresden experiences during the war so why not just write a semiautobiographical novel without blending in scifi one thing he has done is create in billy pilgrim the protagonist of his novel a sort of cult figure and hero in american culture and i guess its easy to see why slaughterhousefive is a war novel but one that twists and shouts with a strange warped feel to it it is rather cleverly done but it is also rather silly one thing it wasnt was never boring and it does a good job of disguises itself as a sciencefiction piece about time travel and aliens as well framed by a narrator who is a war veteran he embarks on writing an account of his experiences in ww when he was a pow in dresden germany  the shift of focus from the true horrors of war suggests that the brutality of the experience is too harsh and horrific to be addressed headon i would rather see it like that full in the face and that it needs to be looked at sideways or upside down mediated by a thick layered narrative to hide the nasty stuff vonnegut has a distinctive style of writing that is disjointed and episodic which also has a cinematic quality perhaps this style is also in keeping with the story of a man who becomes unstuck in time and begins to view life not as a continuum and death not as the end but as moments which when chronology is pushed aside causes the finality of circumstances to lose their significance which also takes away the sting of hopeless events in ones existence  others may see much humour in here but for me it only came in small amounts and the fact it is more like a novella than a fullon novel makes sense its essentially a short sharpe assault on the senses but sadly for me not one to keep on running through my thoughts after finishing it what a strange book i honestly have no idea what this really was about i enjoyed parts of it other parts however dragged like a bitch soooo  stars  three good things  you have never read a story like this before it is completely original and different from everthing else  there are passages and writing techniques in this book that you will never forget eg the use of the phrase so it goes after every death that is mentioned in this tale it is so simple yet memorable and effective because it normalizes the war and thousands of people dying with three simple words  even though this was a strange account of the second world war it showed quite clearly the devastating consequences of war and how inevitable a war is when humans are involved what he meant of course was that there would always be wars that they were as easy to stop as glaciers i believe that too and even if wars didnt keep coming like glaciers there wuld still be plain old death  it is so short and jumbled and jangled sam because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre  three bad things  this book with its unreliable narrater and  of different layers of plot is quite overwhelming  there are no relatable characters in this piece and its extremely hard to feel for any of them even though they go through some tough shit  by the end of the book youre probably going to think what the fuck did i just read and then move on the story will only leave an impact on you if you do further and deeper research  so what is it about thats a really good question in the first chapter we are introduced to the author himself yep vonnegut talks about that he really had to serve in world war ii and that he witnessed and survived the bombing of dresden he then proceeds on telling the reader how hard it was to actually write a novel about the war because he forgot a lot and there is still information being withheld by the government he talks about how he went to visit his war buddy ohare to help him remembering the war ohares wife doesnt like the idea of vonnegut writing about the war because she fears that he will romanticize it and wont acknowledge that they were basically babies back then vonnegut reassures here that he wont do such a thing dedicates his book to her and names it the childrens crusade people arent supposed to look back im certainly not going to do it anymore ive finished my war book now the next one i write is going to be fun this one is a failure and had to be since it was written by a pillar of salt how fucking perfect was that i was sooo hooked after the first chapter i wish the whole book would have been about vonnegut but nooooo he had to write about billy pilgrim  billy pilgrim is the protagonist of this tale the remainder of this tale is about him billy pilgrim served in germany in the second world war as well billy pilgrim is unstuck in time he says he was abducted by aliens the trafalmadorians who showed him the fourth dimension he says he now knows that every moment is infinite and happens at the same time i guess therefore billy pilgrim can travel in time basically he is sometimes in the year  with ronald weary serving in the war getting imprisoned by the germans sometimes in the year  in which he has to face off with his daughter who worries for him because she thinks hes crazy i mean who can blame her sometimes with the tralfamadorians and a hot porn star whom he has impregnated on this foreign planet yes yes totally believable this totally happened you cannot help but thinking that billy is totally crazy or rather suffers from ptsd he has no friends the memories of the war are haunting him and he is trying to cope with it this whole being unstuck in time seems like a coping mechanism to me he is jumpy and paranoid  a siren went off scared the hell out of him he was expecting world war three at any time  they had both found life meaningless partly because of what they had seen in war  so they were trying to reinvent themselves and their universe science fiction was a big help i really liked how vonnegut was a distinct character in this novel he comes up as a soldier whom billy pilgrim meets eventually in dresden but that as a writer of this piece he was omnipresent in every other characer as well there is some vonnegut in billy pilgrim and there is definately some vonnegut in kilgore trout the writer of the scifi novels of which billy is a huge fan of  i also appreciated vonneguts criticism of religion and how hypocritical it gets when it comes to tough times like a war in which people are senselessly slaughtering one another the flaw in the christ stories said the visitor from outer space was that christ who didnt look like much was actually the son of the most powerful being in the universe readers understood that so when they came to the crufixion they naturally thought  oh boythey sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time and that thought had a brother there are right people to lynch who people not well connected so it goes i also really liked how vonnegut emphasized how unimportant humans and the earth are in the scope of the universe as a whole when billy visits tralfamadore he suspects that the humans with their wars must be a pain in the ass to the universe but the tralfamadorians just laugh and tell him how little the earth really means and that the universe will live on i liked that he kept things in perspective  this book has many odd and hilarious moments because billy is so serious in his craziness he knows a lot about the future eg that he will one day get on an airplane which will crash and hell be the only surviver on the way to the hospital his wife will die he knows that these things must happen have already happened man the fourth dimension keeps fucking with my brain and therefore alters nothing billy pilgrim got onto a chartered airplane in ilium twentyfive years after that he knew it was going to crash but he didnt want to make a fool of himself by saying so but it were those odd moments and the unbelievably original and weird concept of this book that kept me interested in the story it is definately one of those books that i have to revisit when im older because im sure i wasnt quite ready for it just yet and a lot of references flew over my head  favorite quotes  how niceto feel nothing and still get full credit for being alive   engraving on a tombstone everything was beautiful and nothing hurt this was my second time reading and i didnt remember much from the first but i knew my first time through was a  star experience i was interested in seeing if that had changed  while this is a very interesting and bizarre book with lots of potential discussiondebate points it was still just  stars for me i wasnt drawn into it and the choppy flow with repetitive themes kind of made me start to lose interest  this may be considered vonneguts classic but it was not my favorite of his works that i have read i recall reading vonnegut novels on my own time while in high school in the early s and liking them very much especially cats cradle but i never got around to slaughterhouse five about the bombing of dresden until now  from his introduction i learned that vonnegut had been working on or at least thinking about his dresden novel for many years but other than his memories he could not come up with much detail about the bombing he actually contacted the us air force for more information and was told it was secret he called an old war buddy working as a da in pennsylvania who had been with him in dresden vonnegut went to visit him the friend could not or did not want to remember much  it seems likely that theres more in the page wikipedia entry about the bombing of dresden than vonnegut knew at the time he wrote his book frankly i dont think this novel stands the test of time the scifi element is very clunky and reads like filler to make up for the fact that he did not have enough material about dresden to write a book about that alone to continue after mobydick on a theme of books with a hyphen in the title but not in the concept as mentioned within the book  i feel like i have a lot more time for kurt vonneguts ideas than for his execution which is not to say that his execution is bad at all just that i find him a very acquired taste my partner swears by him has copies of pretty much everything he ever wrote rereads timequake every couple of years and seems to have an endless fascination with vonneguts attitude to humanity  im also fascinated by that last but in a kindof more anguished way i have a tough time with the choppiness of vonneguts writing the spareness of his characterbuilding the fact that he never goes very far inside anyones head before coming right back out again circling them once or twice and going on to the next thing it strikes me i dont know if it strikes me as a bit masculine somehow or maybe i just know a few men who can really get behind it and a few women who really cant  one of the things that for me takes on a significance in my relationship with kurt vonnegut is a quote of his from somewhere or other not this book at any rate where he said i know what women want they want a whole lot of people to talk to what do they want to talk about they want to talk about everything  and i remember getting briefly outraged at getting lumped into the universal category of all women before i realised hes absolutely right i do want to have a lot of people to talk to  not all the time not right there at every moment  but i want to have people i can talk to about contemporary literature and seventeenth century english politics and human rights in africa and astronomy and poisson distributions and when i meet a new person what makes them or breaks them for me is how interesting they are last night my partner and i spurofthemoment went to a lecture on the use of petrification by nineteenthcentury italian medical doctors weird shit and apparently we still dont exactly know how they did it  how interesting is that people study this stuff so maybe the problem i have with kurt vonnegut is not that he doesnt get things but that hes got my number really easily in two rhetorical questions and he rubs me up the wrong way with how he puts it  and that brings me back round to slaughterhousefive which im sure for vonnegut for many people just is what its like to be in a war and have been in a war and not to want to be anywhere near it any more its stark its graphic in places it pulls no punches and i cannot get my head around it  maybe there is an alternative reality where i am not yelling stop telling me about war wrong at a dead veteran and instead i have been in a city siege myself in that reality i have been shipped out to a place i dont understand with no shelter or means of protecting myself physically or mentally i am frozen cold and bullied away til theres nothing left of me i have been a prisoner and the world around me has been flattened completely by bombing and then years later i pick up slaughterhousefive and i shake and i shake because it rings true to me but thats not this world and this book feels like it was meant to resonate with people who know it already rather than to build it for people who dont  what the trouble boils down to i suppose is that i dont have enough in common with kurt vonnegut to like his book i dont doubt that this book does something important and good and clever or that vonnegut has hit upon something that works for a lot of people but we are working at different frequencies and i dont really think theres very much i can do about that  glad he wrote it glad i read it and now i shall retreat to find a writer who reverberates round my head til my vision goes funny  stars an intelligent book about the absolute uselessness of war and its effect of people enjoyed the aliens with the philosophy that all things have already happened along the time stream and you can visit any time you wish  nominee hugo award for best science fiction novel  nominee nebula award for best science fiction novel i was trying to define the difference between literary fiction and commercial fiction recently only to struggle with the usual superfluous nonsense about whether something is genre or not or what kind of prose or style the author brings to the work after reading slaughterhousefive i think i have a definition that works for me commercial fiction tries to get you to enjoy it literary fiction couldnt care less  and thats a good thing  to say that every act of reading should be pleasurable is like saying we should only ever think happy thoughts slaughterhousefive is not only filled with many unhappy thoughts it doesnt even give us the respite of a main character railing against the injustice of the world instead billy pilgrim takes on a fatalist attitude rendered through the frequent leitmotif of so it goes even more frustrating for many modern readers this fatalism manifests as a distinct lack of any kind of agency billy trundles not only through the world and his own life but even through time never once attempting to take control of the time jumps that send him from the horrors of dresden at the end of wwii to his comfortable life as an optometrist in postwar america to the strange planet of fourthdimensional creatures who put him in a zoo and have him procreate with a similarly kidnapped film actress all this takes place in a jumbled order with characters coming and going not so much for the sake of the plot but for the sake of whatever joke vonnegut is making at the time these are not laughoutloud jokes mind you but ones played upon billy pilgrim and youll come to find on the reader  these stylistic choices whether they appeal to one or not are part of the package this is how vonnegut gets you to experience billy pilgrims life and more importantly the absurdism of the very notion that there can be any nobility or purpose to war so you have to accept this going in and instead of resenting the book for not conforming to the comfortable style of modern genre fiction accept that when reading one of the classics its the readers job to learn the particular language of the book  i was okay with all of that you find the rhythms eventually and learn to see the subtle shifts in delivery that break through what would otherwise seem like a monotonous neverchanging pace what ultimately kept me from fully enjoying the book wasnt any of these literary conceits but simply that  despite being a short novel  slaughterhousefive repeats the same idea over and over without ever seeming to expand or explore it further its been accused of being a quietist novel  a story that tells us not to resist not to fight back but simply to passively accept the world horrors and all and take what comfort we can from that acceptance i dont know if that was vonneguts intent but it does read that way to me  in some ways slaughterhousefive reads almost as an antiexistentialist novel it says the universe is absurd and devoid of meaning but never suggests the existentialists path of choosing ones own set of meanings and living authentically to those for this reason i found slaughterhousefive to be a bit more depressing than i think readers at the time of its publication would have found it then again maybe i just read it wrong thats always the danger with literary fiction in addition to not caring whether we enjoy it it also isnt particularly concerned that we understand it making the effort though is always worthwhile which is why im glad i finally read slaughterhousefive i have to admit to a little bit of disappointment  i was hoping for something brilliant which would blow me away instead i got an okay book which i quite enjoyed so i am left wondering what all the hype is about i did like the story i really liked the idea of billy losing himself in time and wanted more about that i was interested to discover more about the war than i already knew i felt the book was too short by half i did not appreciate the repetition of so it goes so only three stars and another must read book knocked off my list so it goes the only vonnegut book i have read before now is cats cradle and i read that a long time ago so i am not terribly familiar with vonnegut i didnt know much about this book except that it had been based on vonneguts pow experience during the dresden fire bombing of wwii i thought to have witnessed such an event from the ground would be something worth reading so it made my should have read by now list while i didnt really have any specific expectations i must say that this book was something i could never have foreseen let alone expect i am not sure how to characterize the writing was this surrealism or the meandering thoughts of a character suffering from brain damage resulting from a plane crash whatever i was reading it sure was different and certainly a creative method for telling a story i guessed that this was meant to be surrealism i think to have witnessed something as horrific as the fire bombing of an entire city and the resulting carnage and death would have been traumatic in the extreme for any human being how could a person describe this to somebody else what would be the words to use are there such words i believe the authors choice to opt for surrealism is perfectly understandable and i have no argument with the choice nevertheless the story really didnt have the impact i would have thought such an event would have on a reader why i suspect that the technique of the writing its novelty and uniqueness has become the primary focus of the reading the writing has supplanted the story and its message i also considered that this book was published in the late s the era of the antiwarcounterculture movement is it possible that this book was written to appeal to a popular attitude of its time and that the passage of this attitude has dated this book i suspect it has the authors message is clear but i believe it has been diluted by the novelty the author chose to convey it i give the book my three star worth the investment of time and expense to read i enjoyed the book but i think i probably would have enjoyed it more had i read it while i was in college and when the book came out today it is an interesting book primarily for its technique im going to start off by saying that i loved this book as a book and i love james franco as an actor but james francos narration of this audiobook is so whiny and nasally that it is hard to listen he talks this way throughout the whole darn thing i hoped he was going to stop talking like that at first but he doesnt theres even some parts where hes doing character voices and it sounds like hes doing an impersonation of tommy wiseau i would have thought that even if he hadnt done the disaster artist this was worst than when he cohosted the oscars and who knows maybe its cuz anne hathaway wasnt there to save is ass damn you franco damn you time travel sci fi war this is definitely not my preferred genre at all as i normally steer clear of books of this nature but i must say i did like the layered themes of this book its so much more than an anti war book its also witty and full of satire humour i can definately see the universal appeal of this book and how it has stamped its place in popular culture i couldnt help smile at the genius of this book still i had trouble with the narrative it did shoot off into some weird places a little too science fictioney for me although maybe an extra point for ethan hawkes narrative i have a soft spot thereso it goes this is one of those books where i know ive read it before in the longago but then when i sat down to read it for my reallife book club last month i realized i had no memory of anything that happened within the story  to be fair though i have that experience a lot with vonnegut where i always have to say which one is that again because aside from my mind being a sieve when it comes to my memories vonnegut is yes gonna say it avert your eyes sort of forgettable  billy pilgrim is a seemingly unforgettable character though i mean how many characters in literature have become unstuck in time i cant really think of any others and while this is an interesting story involving aliens how did i forget those and the firebombing of dresden theres actually more going on than i generally get out of vonneguts novels they are generally amusing and help pass the time particularly when its  youve just had surgery and youre on pain pills that make you sleep through most of the day and then youre up for half the night so you raid your partners minilibrary of vonnegut novels to stave off boredom or maybe that only happened to me  what i found especially interesting about this book is the very frank depiction of a character suffering from ptsd i have a kneejerk reaction to a lot of portrayals of mental hospitals and mental hospital patients in literature and film but occasionally someone gets it right i feel that vonnegut got it right here in that i didnt feel he wrote this exploitatively like a so many others i understand this book was semiautobiographical and im sure it wasnt the aliens vonnegut himself experienced so im fairly certain he drew from his own experiences with ptsd to write billy pilgrims story  sometime if you have an opportunity to watch the  william dieterle film ill be seeing you starring joseph cotten ginger rogers and shirley temple i highly recommend it cottens character is home from a military hospital to readjust to daily life the long and short of it is he is suffering from shellshock something i havent seen very frequently if at all really depicted in the films of the early th century there is one particular scene in the movie that is especially powerful in both the way it is shot and cottens performance where he is clearly having a panic attack of sorts brought on by his ptsd  i remember watching that scene and being sort of blown away by how honestly the portrayal of a character suffering from shellshock was especially in a film that came out in  while wwii was still happening compare it to for example the  movie the best years of our life  this one was um a chore to watch but i know its like one of the best movies ever made or something while it too showed the return of soldiers to their homes in brutal honesty at times it also had a glorification to war that i felt was missing from ill be seeing you  glorification of war was also missing from vonneguts novel its a brutal account of the after effects a very honest showing of activities that can occur during war and its a strange book to read because while all that very serious stuff is going on there are these tralfamadorians who observe billy pilgrim like a creature in a zoo and it is quite honestly rather absurd but it didnt feel hokey like so much of vonneguts books can feel  powerful at times humorous at others and vonnegutian all the way through one of my favorite novels by him but thats also not saying a whole lot i still say he didnt write women very well but thats not an uncommon issue  so it goes im not really sure what to think about this one it was interesting in that i was curious where all the little snippets and fragments would be going and how they would all come together but i cant really say that they did except in the vastly interpretable possibilities  there werent really any characters that i could identify with the main character just listlessly wanders through life being shepherded along by whatever circumstances come accepting everything not even caring enough about his own life to try to save it the narratorauthor finds his way into the story a few times but we learn nothing about him really and he adds next to nothing to the story unless its supposed to add a mild sense of realism it didnt for me it only confused me as i wasnt sure how a separate person would know all about the ma
The Old Man and the Sea,a story of a destroyed but undefeated thin old gaunt man santiago with an unlucky boat a story of a decrepit man with deep neck wrinkles everything was old about him but for his cheerful and infallible eyes with no fisherman luck but a helpinghand in a young boy with ardour and empathy manolin the bond between the two is way too adorable though the circumstances distance the two physically but could not deter the love between the two both have sincere love and care for each other one day the old man ventures onto the outer lying areas of the sea lost in his musings a gigantic fish marlin eats his sardine bait breaking his reverie what follows is sheer adventure on the sea but santiago keeps feeling alone keeps cursing his diminishing strength he says hail marys and our fathers to magically assist his quest for conquering the fish it is a story of adventure of the man to get hold of marlin what happens during the expedition and upon his return kindly read for yourself to swim and breathe   my views  i am personally a fan of stories about sea and seafarers this story is emblematic of it and corroborated the concept phenomenonally  in entirety and handsomely indeed a masterpiece the appealing themes of unity undying heroism and obsession with proving ones worthiness are propounded gracefully  i forever tried my best to increase the rating beyond stars but could not seriously in a pickle situation   maybe because of the exposition of hopelessness declining age and at no juncture of the story seeing infusedhope refrained me from falling in truelove with this awardwinning story i am a sucker of hopeinducing plotsthough santiago remains undefeated till the end still the signals of despondency and downheartedness at smooth intervals gave me a grimace of pain  at no point i was unleashed from this vicious cycle of pain and despondency conferred on by oldage and dwindling muscle  oldage is fated inevitable and a hardfact which cannot be changed and hence wailing over it and commiserating didnt do any good to me irrespective of the lack santiago keeps fighting which is creditable  one of my biggest takeaways from my personal life is harping or sympathizing with irrevocably painful truths pervades more despondence and imparts infirmity  again this is purely my stance so couldnt go beyond stars    what stood out for me  the unique relationship between the old man and boy comprising of sincere love and friendship afterall they had spent countless hours on the sea together love and concern werent incumbent on the boy but just out of compassion for the old man   old age  the limitation of being old is shown clearly in this story though the old man keeps cursing his diminishing strength old and decrepit body but he remains undefeated until the very end of his battle with the sea as stated earlier irrespective of being unbeaten i personally was cast down onlooking the shrinking strength and grim circumstances of santiago  the closing line mentions about him dreaming of lions lions are symbolic of valor strength and youth according to me he dreamt of them hoping to get back his youth or found solace and comfort basking in his memories of youththis story propounds a lot on aging and diminishing strength    nb i havent shared any events during the expedition or upon his return there are existing brimming reviews on grs openly disclosing spoilers for this story and many other stories but yet not marked the title the old man and the sea is the biggest spoiler in itself so faultfinders and overtly sensitive readers kindly sue ernst hemingway  thanks ernest hemingway is considered one of the masters of american th century fiction garnering from his life experiences his novels reflect on his time as a newspaper reporter and correspondent in a europe during both the inner war and war years a member of the lost generation hemingway was the first of his group to have a major work published in addition to all of the accolades bestowed upon him hemingway is considered along steinbeck to be a master storyteller especially of short stories the crowning achievement to an illustrious career the old man and the sea won the pulitzer prize for fiction in  less than ten years before hemingways death  santiago is an older fisherman in havana he is content fishing and contemplating on his life while finding out the daily baseball scores his favorite ball player is joe dimaggio because his father was a famed fisherman as a younger man santiago was considered the strongest man in havana one time outlasting a negro from cienfuegos in a twenty four hour arm wrestling duel yet despite his fame and accomplishments as a fisherman santiagos luck has run out on hm as an older man her needs help from a boy to complete his daily fishing hauls and tasks and has not caught a fish in  days in spite of this run of poor luck santiago still returns to the seas on a daily basis hopeful to catch the big fish that has alluded him for his entire life  because of lack of successes his boy has turned to another lucky fishing boat santiago has to go at it alone with only two fishing lines and baits determined to catch that big one he sets out even with the dangers of sea especially sharks knowing that each journey into the water could be his last yet this is subsistence and sustenance for many people on an island so santiago persists at his task his voyage for the big fish becomes more than a fishing trip but his contemplating life bestowing his wisdom on both the fishing trade and life knowledge on the younger generations this is without the assurance that he will even catch a fish or if this determination to catch the big one will be his last voyage  from this  page novella one can see glimpses of hemingways greatness his sentences are full of imagery and imparting the wisdom of a rich life as an older man he himself enjoyed fishing and santiago mirrors how hemingway spent his later life i have read a number of pulitzers and while the writing of this novella is enriching i am left wondering if perhaps hemingway won the award here as a crowning jewel on his life body of work the story was captivating and full of messages yet a novella rather than a novel perhaps unbeknownst to me this powerful novella was the best work of fiction in its given year and worthy of the award  in my quest to read the pulitzers i am glad that i was finally lead to read hemingway it is clear to me that he is a master of his craft and i look forward to reading his further work the old man and the sea looks back on an enriching life and won hemingway a deserving award if not for his lifetime of writing as a lovely story and another pulitzer i can check off my list the old man and the sea rates  powerful stars my big fish must be somewhere  many years ago when i read the old man and the sea i thought it was going nowhere that it was too simple and ordinary to be of any consequence on a second reading however my view changed and i ended up loving it what i mistook for repetition was a literary device for emphasis and the boat like the story that i judged to be unmoving in the rolling seas was caught in a whirlpool churning the waters in its depth so that the boat and the old man at the sea were never at rest till the end  although grounds for comparison do not exist reading this novella orhan pamuk came to mind its their ability to weave the many similar threads of narrative into a stunning improvisatory whole that turns a small and prima facie simple scenario that might be covered in a few pages into an expanded mass of words that transcends the boundaries of its immediate context to inform on larger human struggle repetition or artistic improvisation when done well is fascinating and here orhan pamuk and ernest hemingway appear brothersinarms you start with a pin prick of a view that widens and opens out into a wide vista giving you a clear view of the clutter of human ethos  like his so many stories its a tale of a heroic struggle but only inasmuch as a fraillegged ant suffers to get a tiny lump of sugar to its colony to claim its superiority on the lesser types a knackered old man dreaming on the seas of a big catch in a boat fit for the axe of a lumberjack with a young boy for a helper do not evoke the romantic world of heroic battles fought by the gunwielding machismo of hemingways other stories this is something simpler in its setting yet more profound in its humanistic import  a piece of writing  a prose story or a poem  becomes great because it has no single fixed literal meaning that forbids imagination it is the reader who picks up the idea consistent with the subjective conditions of his own worldview interpreting the text changing it and then getting changed by it in turn this novella lends itself to interpretation on multiple levels and for its rich imagery of natural elements and human emotions remains one of the very best hemingway offered us  this was my very first hemingway and i loved it however i am not sure if it broke me for future hemingway novels this one was so perfect in its simpleness when i got to other hemingway novels it was almost like there was too much in them  i wanted the basics of this book again that is not to say that i have not enjoyed his other books but if i had read the others first and wasnt tempted to compare them to this i would have rated them higher  so if you want to read lots of hemingway maybe dont start here i would suggest probably a farewell to arms followed by the sun also rises i dont think i would recommend for whom the bell tolls until you were sure you are into hemingway  if you have always thought about reading hemingway and you just want a taste with the chance that you may not read more the old man and the sea is a perfect place to start on the first glance the old man and the sea is a very simple story about a cuban fisherman fighting against a giant marlin on the second glance  it is still a very simple story you wont find any complex characters in this story you wont find even the smallest trace of complexity one can try to find symbolisms in this story and will most likely succeed but as ernest hemingway said himself  there isnt any symbolism the sea is the sea the old man is an old man the boy is a boy and the fish is a fish the sharks are all sharks no better and no worse all the symbolism that people say is shit what goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know  what remains when you take away the lack of complexity a powerful tale about the efforts of a human being to achieve a certain goal and about how easy it is to lose what you have won and powerful it is indeed i was familiar with hemingways writing style and his tragic life due to preparing a school presentation about him years ago and reading some of his short stories so i was able to direct my expectations to the necessary direction ultimately finding  as surprising as this may sound  a lot to enjoy in here  i dont know if any other author would have been able to spend  pages on a subject as simple as this although dickens probably could but ernest hemingway succeeded in the attempt creating a timeless classic the language is not very demanding  sometimes even poor if you look at the way he repeats himself unnecessarily at passages every writing adviser would cringe at and yet there is something powerful endearing behind those words something which lures you in without you even realizing it it is impossible to describe the atmosphere within this tale read it for yourself if you are open for classics without a lot of action going on  and this is a short one a story i read in the course of two hours with interruptions  or dont if you need your complex plots for everyone else id highly recommend it after eightyfive fishless days santiago hooks more than he bargained for can he battle everything the sea throws at him to land his prize  in the interest of reading a wider variety of things i snapped this up like an eighteenfoot marlin bites a baited hook it was definitely worth a read  the old man and the sea is the tale of an old man and a sea its man vs nature at its finest hemingways language is spare but very powerful i felt every wound and heartbreak along with santiago and was nearly as worn out as the old fisherman by the end of the tale  if you havent already had the ending spoiled for you do yourself a favor and steer clear of introductions reviews and wikipedia summaries i knew the ending before i got there due to reading an excerpt in middle school and the experience would have been much better going in cold  what else is there to say it didnt win a nobel prize for literature for nothing for years the only hemingway id read was the sun also rises and i wasnt overly fond of it however the old man and the sea has made me a believer four out of five stars since theres about  reviews of the old man and the sea on goodreads and theyre likely better then this one im keeping it brief  im surprised with how much i enjoyed this book this is my first book by hemingway and im glad i started with the old man and the sea  its pretty straightforward theres an old fisherman hes broke and hes had the worse luck with fishing recently he lives in cuba and this was written back in  so the fishing is old school i honestly cant imagine trying to fish like santiago  the old man goes off to find a big fish and he catches a huge one now its a battle of who will survive between the old man and the marlin on another note since i talk to myself at times reading about santiago talking to himself didnt bother me at all what else is he going to do while battling the marlin and trying to survive in the sea  i loved the tenacity of this old goat and how he would not give up especially when the sharks showed up holy smokes santiago was doing all he could to make sure the marlin wasnt eaten by the sharks i was so mad at those sharks the old man does all that work could have died while battling the marlin and the sharks take his damn fish away just goes to show you that the sea will likely always win  i really liked the relationship between the old man and the marlin its like they became kindred souls together on this epic journey check out the old man and the sea if youre working on your classics you enjoy fishing or you love the ocean  dont remember the exact time when i started forgetting things let alone the reason be a medical or psychological i forget remembering my forgetfulness even at times and things go irrevocably wrong but our dear brain do quiver things with us our memory is discerning in keeping things and the only reminiscence i have in all its luminous shape is of the way to school of the old man i used to pass in my way daily there was something in his eyes even as a child i could sense that or i was the only child who could sense that because no other one seemed to even notice him his wrinkled weatherworn face had a pair of speaking eyes they spoke as you looked into them same as the santiago of hemmingway had everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated santiago and hemmingway both are entwined together too much to shun the autobiographical acclaim of the struggle away hemmingway wrote his last work to restore the position of his literary genius and succeeded undoubtedly the story is quite simple one like the style of eh even the principle heroism of hemmingway novels is not prevalent heresantiagois not to be expected to have macho expeditions fighting supernatural forces projecting immaculate masculine powers what he is is a man destroyed but not defeated what he fights is life itself and what he fights foris not mere living hemmingway is at his best while portraying the sea imagery the sound the air the smell and sight all seen through the words and lived through the eyes of old man are more like a character rather than objects the sea itself is symbolized with life and all it has to offer the treasures and miseries and sorrows for those who mistook her for a woman who can be wooed with hearty songs santiago knows the skills but lacks the fate he is not to take the biggest catch of his life home albeit his struggle of three days with mighty marlin the ambivalence in the treatment of pride is very much vivid in throughout the novella  a heroic man like santiago should have pride in his actions and as santiago shows us humility was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride but in truth wasnt it the pride that drove the old man past from usual sea stations beyond all people in the world to catch the marlin while he loved the marlin and called him brother santiago admits to killing it for pride the excitement that stirs the blood that rushes through those old veins while battling the mighty antagonist is unshakably nothing else than a notion of pride and after all as wilde says  yet each man kills the thing he loves by each let this be heard some do it with a bitter look some with a flattering word the coward does it with a kiss the brave man with a sword    the plot is pretty much known the old man  santiago a fisherman poor and with wife either gone or dead  goes to the sea one september in early th century cuba to catch a fish a marlin and is gone a long time his best supporter in his home town is manolin a young boy who wants to become a fisherman too and who helps him get by when not at sea and the fish  my big fish  is the challenge a footer that surfaces first time right in the middle of the story which i feel was written to happen so  i figure this is cuba from the mention of havana and the hatuey beer the old man and the boy also discuss baseball here and there including dimaggio the old man is made fun of or pitied mostly though at the end when he comes back with the fish eaten right down to skeleton by the sharks he might be viewed differently for a while  i observe him as he spends time on the boat thinking about his past lifes moments of glory and witnessing the natural beauty moments while working especially the lions i witnessed the toughness of the chase hand cramps cord burns cuts the tiredness the varying levels of consciousness and perhaps the breaking of a rib which couldve been the reason for bloodspitting the moment when he finally gets to harpoon the marlin was almost close to feeling it for this reading very intenese and then the sharks made me feel the intensity again even though the loss would be inevitable  no chance of pulling the marlin on the boat sigh i almost expected there to be a storm among other things but that didnt happen xd  but at the end when hes back home the despair of loss is in my opinion somewhat averted as the man and the boy already start making plans for more fishing even if the old mans experience and desire to catch a similar toughtoget fish might be gone it seems the boy is more motivated to be a fisherman and the slightly amusing moment at the end with the tourists and the shark skeleton is very fitting and makes for a perfect ending for this great experience of a story sad book read it but know it is sad this is probably written at about a th grade reading level and the audience is at least that broad  ill spare you the christ imagery chitchat  why did ernest hemingway cross the road no this book is not a smooth read it will probably not give you a good time you might not read it again in the future you will simply keep living your life and nothing will change  but you will find yourself thinking about this book time and again nothing really specific or significant no you will probably think about the old man or the boy or the sea or sharks but this will surely come back to you  and life will go on yours and the old mans hi  im drunk again  so this book ostensibly about a geriatric dude who goes fishing the old man and the sea covers way more bases than that one could say it is a book whose themes include the solitude of man or um one being pitted against the world or maybe even a powerlessness against nature or whatever and all of these things may be true but i think i would have enjoyed this touching novella even if it didnt capture those thematic bases of course i only say that because i enjoyed the book to the extent that i did and had it not employed those themes into its narrative perhaps i wouldnt have liked it so much who the fuck knows but i did and heres i think one of the reasons why hemingway writes like a simpleton i remember this sort of stripped down bare bones writing from books like for whom the bell tolls and stories like hills like white elephants which is one of my favorite short stories ever by the way and it works just as well here if not for different reasons  santiago is an old man who fishes out of his skiff somewhere in the gulf of mexico havana is mentioned so maybe this takes place in cuba although  of the story takes place in the ocean so it doesnt even really freaking matter the point is santiago is an old man who fishes out of his skiff somewhere in the gulf of mexico he lives alone and has seemingly one close friend a young boy namedactually i forget his name thats really weird i just finished this book yesterday and i already forgot the kids name  oh  manolin yes thats right manolin anyway manolins his only friend and theres a level of mutual respect and admiration that exists between the two characters which is highlighted by the very understatedness of hemingways simpleton writing the boy wants to go with the old man oh who cares about names anyway except the boys parents have decided maybe he shouldnt hang out with the old man and not because the old man is creepy or anything which youd think might be a bit concerning but apparently nope its the fact that the old man hasnt caught a fish in four months which is a super long time not to catch a fish when all you do in life is catch fish  so the old man goes out into the sea by himself and breaks his fishless streak by landing himself the biggest marlin ever and theres a lot of internal struggle that occurs here which is brillianttheres selfdoubt which creeps into the old mans psyche and is replaced by fake it til you make it confidence which then circles back into more selfdoubt theres an overwhelming sense of loneliness both physical being leagues away from shore and emotional the old man misses the boy but not in a creepy way and theres also this really beautiful union with nature that occurs as the old man tries to land the fish he recognizes the fish as his foe but ultimately becomes one with it as he begins to identify it as an extension of himself its all very layered for a guy whose sentences contain seven words or fewer  i wont say what happens after he catches the marlin because im almost wondering if even saying that is spoilerish but boy howdy do you guys want to know what happens after he catches that marlin or what well then maybe you should read this book  id also like to say that weinz is wrong about margaritas being for pussies that is all so hemingway won the pulitzer prize for a book about an old man in a boat chasing a fish impressive  i tried to analyze it while reading it but i found it way too exhausting because its so simple and to crack open simplicity to unearth something complex is just hard work and to be honest im not convinced hemingway didnt just write a book about a man and a boat and a fish which is enough amazingly  the story made me incredibly sad and i felt immediately sorry for the old man im not sure why because he doesnt feel particularly sorry for himself it was probably his unwillingness to admit how bad things were  and that isnt a thing to pity is it but we do and the boy does and thats why he takes care of him because he wants him to have a better life even when he is himself too stubborn to admit it  the old man just wants to fish he was born to be a fisher and yet he chasesgets chased by a fish beyond the point where its sensible which is only something a man deeply discontent and frustrated with life would do its not about coming back in its about catching the fish once the fish is caught he gains hope he lights up once its gone he collapses and everything returns to where it used to be more or less  but man is not made for defeat he said a man can be destroyed but not defeated  what is he then in the end destroyed or defeated it would be the ultimate humiliation if he isnt destroyed but defeated perhaps not being destroyed is defeat his lack of destruction is his defeat he stops fighting thus ruining his chance of being destroyed  and then comes defeat  i have no idea what it all means really but i understand why it is his most wellknown work and why plenty of people must utterly loathe it i liked it though i like how it can be read as exactly what it is and nothing more or as something layered and complex i particularly love how i can most assuredly reread it in a few years and get something completely different out of it  what you read into it says more about you than the book that was at least the case with me everything i have just said well thats how i feel about life right now and for that to happen you need a strike of genius in the author well done hemingway to be honest this book kept me confused for a while before reading i thought based on reviews and many analyses this is something that is written entirely focused on symbolism for an example like alchemist may be its because the some of underlying ideas are out of my usual scope of understanding or the fishing part was more engaging in any case it didnt become apparent to me any complex underlying messages aside from the obvious one of course such as not giving up in face of difficulties continuous regret on paths that werent chosen or the law of nature santiago is an old fisherman after suffering a prolonged period of bad luck he is determined to catch the one big fish he sails far out beyond the usual limits and does indeed snag a giant an eighteenfooter probably a marlin or sailfish he battles fatigue pain hunger and thirst in an effort to bring in the fish after he finally wins that battle and has the fish strapped to the side of his boat he suffers through a long journey to port havana in which the fish is mostly eaten by sharks  this is a tale of character of strength and determination against the forces of nature maybe better a battle within the forces of nature he sees the fish as a brother and respects his strength and courage he is successful through a reliance on sheer will there is an anecdote in here about a handwrestling contest he had won against a local champion in which simple determination and endurance win out this reflects the battle he wages with the fish he is alone in the boat his young erstwhile assistant having abandoned him for a fisherman with better prospects so it is man vs whatever  although the fish is close to worthless when he gets back he feels great satisfaction in having won the battle in having proved his manhood in a decisive manner  he dreams of lions on an african beach  he thinks about baseball and his hero joe dimaggio wondering if the pain he feels rivals the bone spurs joltin joe suffers the beauty of this  pulitzer prize winner lies in its simplicity  the old man the fish he tries to capture the sea the old mans thoughts and his battle with nature thats it  theres not much plot here but thats not the point anyway its about mans challenge to the elements about persistence in the face of adversity about growing older and probably wiser its about knowing yourself and knowing and accepting your strengths and weaknesses its about not giving up  hemingways writing here might be simple but life isnt and he captured it beautifully  definitely recommended a man can be destroyed but not defeated   it is a novel that describes the epitome of courage simplicity love and most importantly belongingness belongingness between the boy and the old man belongingness between the old man and the sea which is beyond impeccable and of course the fight of luck  every day is a new day it is better to be lucky but i would rather be exact then when luck comes you are ready  a fine short story claiming to know more about life than many well written books the consistency of not giving up on oneself up until whether you achieve anything or nothing at all and also the love of the boy for his master will give your heart a feeling to melt down instantly out of warmth i will surely remember this one for a long long time my first hemingway  the old man and the sea was the first thing ive read by hemingway hardly surprising because it is a part of curriculum for th graders  i suppose it is what makes it the first hemingway for most people needless to say i wasnt able to fully comprehend this story in fourth grade why because of the story itself because of some complex analogy no i actually dont believe there is a single analogy or symbolism in this story it is a story about an old man catching fish what makes this story deep is not some symbol of analogy but the incredibly insightful psychological and spiritual portrayal of this old man as a child one is simply and understandably not able to relate to the experience of growing old not in a way an adult can the story is only seemingly simple and straightforward the narrative composed of simple sentences makes you feel like youre reading some simplified old fashion fairytale but that is only an illusion there is a lot of profound sadness in this story at the end of the story youre either able to understand the old man or you are not in other words you either get it or not it is a story that is much more complex that in may intially seem but not in a symbolic way i dont think we should see santiago as a representation of somebody if anything we should see him as one of us  like conrads lord jim  the plot and the friendship between the boy and the old man  the plot is very simple there is this old fisherman named santiago who befriends or is better to say is befriended by a little boy madolin who also happens to be his apprentice santiago hasnt caught any fish for a long time so madolin parents advise the boy to abandon the old man and become an apprentice of some other more successful fisherman i dont think that the parents of manolin are urging him to spend less time with santiago because theyre following this modern trend of avoiding the old it is just that theyre afraid that the misfortune of santiago for his not having caught any fish for so long is seen as almost a curse will rub onto their son theyre worried that manolin will become unlucky too santiago is determined to end his unlucky streak so he sets on a long journey what follows is his epic struggle with one particularly big fish a giant marlin during which we get to see inside of santiagos soul his doubts become our doubts and his fears become our fears everything that he is opens up before our eyes it is one of the most startling portrayals in literature and it is done with so few words hemingway crafts his sentences with a great restraint theyre minimalist almost bared to the bone and yet there are such moments of poetry that caught you by surprise just like this glimpse into the soul of santiago while he is finishing he remembers the boy obviously santiagos feelings for madolin are very tender he is nearing the end of his life and perhaps this friendship with the boy is a way of sharing what he has learned the boy may also be the motivator for at least of some of his soulsearching he is wondering what he might teach him  im not surprised by the fact that genuine friendship can exist between a young boy and an old man im surprised that anyone could question it in fact friendship between the very young and the very old seems a natural thing to me it is a cursed thing that our society seems to ignore or forget this fact the energy of old people often balances nicely with those of very young it can even help children focus and learn better we are making a grave mistake by pushing the elderly away instead of integrating them in our societies i fear this is done mainly because people are so afraid of dying and death the very old often have the kind of patience that we regular adults lack because of our jobs our duties etc to explain things to children those of us that work with kids have this patience but we develop it for us it is a part of our teaching skills while with the very old it seems a natural thing when i was a kid it was normal to me to spent time with old people i learned many things from the old as is natural for elderly were always the keepers of the lore i wonder is it the case today i would even go so far as to
Catch-22,absurdist plays are one act for a reason  seriously i know there were points to make about the repetitive ridiculousness of bureaucracywarcapitalismlife but over  pages of variations on the catch joke  i did find myself more affected than i would have guessed by some of the deaths and some of the lines were clearly awesome  underlined bits in a world in which success was the only virtue he had resigned himself to failure about the chaplain because he needed a friend so desperately he never found one  about major major since he had nothing better to do well in he did well in school  about same clevinger was one of those people with lots of intelligence and no brains and everyone knew it except those who soon found it out  kraft was a skinny harmless kid from pennsylvania who wanted only to be liked and was destined to be disappointed in even so humble and degrading an ambition  it was neither possible nor necessary to educate people who never questioned anything in an airplane there was absolutely no place in the world to go except to another part of the airplane  actually there were many officers clubs that yossarian had not helped build but he was proudest of the one on pianosa it was a sturdy and complex monument to his powers of determination yossarian never went there to help until it was finished then he went there often so pleased was he with the large fine rambling shingled building it was truly a splendid structure and yossarian throbbed with a mighty sense of accomplishment each time he gazed at it and reflected that none of the work that had gone into it was his  there were terrifying sudden moments when objects concepts and even people that the chaplain had lived with almost all his life inexplicably took on an unfamiliar and irregular aspect that he had never seen before and which made them seem totally strange jamais vu  you put so much stock in winning wars the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed the real trick lies in losing wars in knowing which wars can be lost italy has been losing wars for centuries and just see how splendidly weve done nonetheless   lots of repetitiveness even in that short list reminds me of confederacy of dunces i feel i was bored and frustrated in a similar way but probably wont reread either to search for actual parallels beyond obvious supposedly hilarious classics i outright hated classification there was only one catch and that was catch which specified that a concern for ones safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind orr was crazy and could be grounded all he had to do was ask and as soon as he did he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didnt but if he was sane he had to fly them if he flew them he was crazy and didnt have to but if he didnt want to he was sane and had to yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of catch and let out a respectful whistle  catch did not exist he was positive of that but it made no difference what did matter was that everyone thought it existed and that was much worse for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute to accuse criticize attack amend hate revile spit at rip to shreds trample upon or burn up a couple of years ago i bought the pop chart  essential novels scratchoff chart catch is the th book ive read off that list set during world war ii primarily on a island off the coast of italy catch is an ensemble story of a group of soldiers caught up in an insane military bureaucracy some of them are crazy and some have had craziness thrust upon them the narrative bounces from character to character in a series of vignettes and shifts back and forth in time its not particularly plotdriven though there is an overarching story we keep getting glimpses of throughout until it is fully explained in the final pages  catch is a classic an important work of great literature but its not entertaining unless youre the kind of person who would enjoy  somewhat repetitive pages capturing the phrase military intelligence is an oxymoron the book is full of contradictions like major major never sees anyone in his office while hes in his office and my only fault is that i have no faults it is comic but not funny its neither a heroic nor a gritty war story but an absurdist one a take that im not sure holds up today though it is occasionally gory and while it is unsurprising that the vast majority of characters were men it was still jarring that pretty much every female character was simply a sex object including the one referred to at least a hundred times simply as natelys whore  it was impossible not to notice how heavily the tv show mash borrowed from catch from the ensemble cast and vingette structure to numerous similar characters to the idea that klingers attempt to get out of combat only reinforced the belief that hes sane but id argue mash was a far better work of art because it examined a far wider range of emotions sure there was the same sarcasm and antibureaucracy themes but there was also joy love humor fear catch really only has one note to play and i grew weary of it long before the book ended in fact i was rather like natelys whore who was bored and indifferent and wanted very much to sleep this book is very overrated frankly it is just bad why do some people constantly call this one of the greatest books of the th century one of the worlds greatest mysteries if you want to read a good war satire read slautherhousefive by ole man vonnegut it is still not the best but surely is at least two times if not three better than this weird heller thing ive stopped reading this for the second time in quick succession i really love the idea of catch   that is that there are things in life where for example to show you are crazy you need to say you are crazy but saying you are crazy proves you cant be and while these paradoxes are interesting and sometimes even amusing  i found this book anything but i found that the humour was far too laboured and far too overthetop to be really all that funny the repetitions in the book started to drive me nuts too not just the obvious repetitions of things to identify characters  although these made the characters seem to be more caricatures and highly irritating ones at that  but also the idea that this was a working through of every example of a catch  situation that the writer could think up also started to annoy me i know it was meant as parody but   i think part of the problem may be that i think the humour has not aged well i have had a very similar experience with a book i loved when i first read it a hundred years ago  milligans puckoon but when i started reading it again recently i had to stop half way through as i barely getting a smile out of it this has worried me greatly as i was thinking of going back and reading his adolf hitler my part in his downfall  but might just rely on my pleasant memories of that book  i had really hoped to enjoy this and perhaps i would have if i had read it in the s when i first planned to  but unfortunately this one didnt work for me nearly as well as i had hoped now i just found it far too heavyhanded hmmm so one of my goodreads groups had wwii as a theme and this was one of the books we read this month i hadnt read this before so was keen to try it it is a classic after all so i thought it would be interesting  i downloaded this on audible the book itself is wonderfully read by trevor white who did much to make this outing bearable my husband watched warily as i downloaded the title said blankly you wont like that and turned back to the snooker this shows that at least he knows my tastes as i really found this a struggle  this is of course the story of yossarian and his squadron who are doomed to fly neverending missions in wwii the number of missions keep increasing and it seems that yossarian  who understandably feels that everyone is out to get him killed  will never manage to get sent home  without doubt this is a clever satire the enemy as far as yossarian is concerned are his superior officers all colluding in what he sees all too clearly as his future demise there are a host of other characters and it takes some time to work out who is who and what their place in the storyline is some of these characters are female but well  they are hardly part of the story  i suppose you expect banter and sexist talk in a novel written in this period the sort of behaviour shrugged off as locker room talk not that long ago just about every female who ventures warily into the pages of this book is grabbed groped abused and insulted women are on the game out for money looking for sex and play no other role than to excite violent sexual talk dreams and behaviour in the men somehow this goes well beyond casual sexism  had i found this book funny then perhaps it would have helped but i didnt really it could have just been me but i found this an uncomfortable unpleasant read there are some great moments of characterization here so long as youre not a woman at least women arent allowed personalities beyond sex appeal but after  pages theres still no sign of a plot so im officially hitting the eject button and bailing out catch was mildly funny in a exaggerated over the top kind of way its a highly character driven book the hyperbole stereotyped personages are exactly that characters but nonetheless they are oddly believable heller knows people and how to write them the bombastically ridiculous characters are mixed in with utterly real scenarios and those elements mix well but the disjointed timeline and pace is awful i understand what the author is trying to do by structuring chapters around his outlandish characters and not the events but he failed utterly and intertwining his characters storylines with only a few characters interacting meaningfully at any giving time and the reader has little idea when these event took place other authors can relate character with little connection in many different places over a lifetime seamlessly while heller has trouble getting a bomb squad in italy for a couple of years to seem like they belong in the same book thats a major flaw the imagery of war created a vivid atmosphere especially during yossarians last visit to rome but it felt hypocritical and heavy handed through the eyes of a pampered pilot and not a frontline ground trooper or even a civilian who has to live it everyday he was just visiting after all i dont want to write a political review but yossarian was a whiny selfish coward who did harm others by his inaction i understand he had bad superiors but duty is duty he did not help anyone not even natelys whores kid sister stop complaining and finding faults with others and do what your paid to do you can always blame others and make excuses but that never improves anything to those who say this book was ahead of its time i disagree it influence the next generation so much it became theirs this is a common mistake in pop culture yossarian was in the hospital because he had pain in his liver none of the nurses liked him but he was very comfortable in the hospital and wrote letters to everyone he knew then one day he wrote that he was going on a very dangerous mission yossarian was discharged from the hospital and sent back to his squadron to fight the war yossarian initially trained as an aviation cadet then as a bombardiernavigator and eventually transferred for overseas duty  clevinger went missing the day he joined the squadron he was yossarians partner as they shared the room together yossarian wanted to go back home but everytime he finished his missions colonel cathcart would increase them as the catch they all were posted at pianosa in southern itlay yossarian and others didnt wanted to go to bologna because yossarian knew he would be killed there colonel cathcart was very insecure of himself hence to prove his worth he kept increasing the number of missions  yossarian and his colleagues went to the bar to have fun where an italian told them how despite losing war for centuries italy was doing spendidly italy once won a war in ethiopia and promptly stumbled into trouble victory gives an insane delusions of grandeur that italy helped start a world war in which italy didnt had a chance of winning first germany protected us against americans now americans were protecting italy from germany the chaplain also tried to help yossarian and others to reduce the number of flying missions by talking to colonel cathcart but he didnt listen to him  doc daneeka was declared dead even though he was alive his wife started receiving all the allowances hence even she didnt believe his letters and left for michigan without leaving any address after natelys death yossarian refused to fly more combat missions which created a stir and all the superiors were not happy with it according to them morale in other men was deteriorating and it was all yossarians fault but as per yossarian every victim was a culprit every culprit a victim and somone had to stand up sometime to try to break the lousy chain of inherited habit that was imperiling them all  yossarian made a deal with colonel kom and colonel cathcart and they promised to send him back home catch wasnt any order or implication rather a facade which was used to do whatever the superiors wanted you to do they only thought about their image and profits hence nothing else meant anything yossarian decided to run away to sweden which he eventually did  catch is the reality for most of us where we fall for the rat race without realizing that its a never ending mirage the book was emotional apt but sluggish as well as every new chapter brought in various characters later dropped without any closure it was a hotchpotch of characters backend stories and deaths that i lost count of them the message was great the writing not so well at least i am finally done with my tbr  list yeah but i had to finish this long and not very interesting book to complete that list um yeah  i always feel weirded out when i dont like something that is pushed on readers as classics heck i didnt like the catcher in the rye or the fault in our stars so i should realize now that not all books called classics are going to resonate with me  i dont even know how to explain this book there was too much going on catch takes place during the latter part of world war ii we follow a character called yossarian who flies in an air squadron yossarian and several other characters are faking injuries for the most part in order to not be forced from their hospital beds yossarian you realize after a while has to be suffering from ptsd you start to get there later on in the book when you have him recalling events that occurred before he ended up in the hospital bed yossarian is still a hard character to like though he is at times absurd mean spirted nice and then back to being mean and ugly again  catch comes up again and again when you have yossarian realizing that if he pretends to be insane meaning he no longer has to participate in the war then he is really setting himself up by not looking insane since if someone was truly insane they would not know it  there are so many other plotscharacters going on in catch it was very hard to focus as i was reading there felt like there was too much happening and it really made it difficult to wade through the book i realize that heller was trying to say something about the price of war but it was hard to focus on that message when there were so many moving parts and a main character that i really didnt like  one of the other characters who becomes linked to yossarian and has it out for him in the novel which honestly i still dont get why was seriously called natelys whore yeah so there were a lot of unappealing characters in this book  the writing was good i just think that i had a hard time caring about anything that was going on this was up there with getting my teeth cleaned for me i know i have to have it done every couple of months it doesnt mean i am happy about being at the dentist though its just something to suffer through the flow wasnt great due to the book jumping around every chapter or so and deciding to focus on someone or something else  the end when it came i was happy to get to since it meant no more book i would like to begin by saying that i have nothing against senile drunks with adhd i assume heller was all of these things because otherwise i dont know how he could write this thing i would simply rather not read their books i mean what the hell is this he jumps back and forth in time without warning or provocation he talks in circles and recycles jokes and ineffective devices he communicates in  pages what others communicate on a bumper sticker war is bad and only crazy people want anything to do with it  there i just saved you several days of reading  the best i can say for this novel is that it is not nearly as good as mash in the early days and only slightly worse than mash during the last seasons when alda took over and got all preachy this book is considered an american classic novel it is a satirical look at the military and war  unfortunately i have to go against the majority and say this classic didnt do it for me i value the importance of the novel and its message but i just could never really enjoy it this is really weird too considering that it contains many colorful characters and situations these characters did make me chuckle out loud on several occasions the concept of catch is relatable to all as i am pretty sure we have dealt with some form of it dealing with bureaucracy in one form granted not to the extent it was portrayed in this novel  the story is told in a nonlinear form as we hear a scene that could either be out of place in the time setting or the same scene could be told from different character perspectives it took me a while to get use to this to me this novel was just a series of amusing anecdotes mashed together the problem with this is that i got bored with these anecdotes as i did not see any progression in the story halfway thru the book i felt like i was still in the same spot when i first started it i understand this is symbolic of war but i could never relate to it therefore my enjoyment of this novel suffered  i understand that this book is beloved by many and it is a very important novel i am not one of the fans of this classic as i could never connect with it in my opinion it was too long and a repeat of the same thing the catch for me is that i thought the characters were colorful and i did laugh but i still did not like the book it pains me to give up on any book without having finished it but i just cant take any more in this case shallow and sophomoric page after page of submarx brothers dialogue seriously just watch duck soup instead and cardboard characters the bulk of which seem to exist for no other reason than to drive home yet another unfunny joke i get it war is absurd i was with you on that before i opened to page one heller says the same things over and over again and although the book is often lauded for its circular logic to me its simply redundant and directionless i dont feel like im in the hands of an accomplished author who knows exactly what hes doing and where hes taking the reader the whole thing feels amateurish im tired of it after  pagescant imagine reading the  that remain but dont you want to see what happens no ive never felt less engaged with any cast of characters than i do with this one i suspect that whether or not a reader will enjoy this book largely depends on whether they actually find the authors sense of humor amusing i dont for every joke that hits the mark and i did laugh a few times there are five that make me cringe i do wish id read it as a teenager because i get the sense that i may have enjoyed it at one time but its too late for that im afraid ive missed the sellby date why do most of my goodreads friends like this did thomas pynchon really claim this as the best novel of its time tom what the    dont say i didnt try after about fifty pages i decided to look up some interviews with heller thinking that perhaps acquainting myself with the artist himself might renew some faith in the work unfortunately what i watched had the inverse effect heller seemed overlyimpressed with himself quoting his own lines to the interviewer and then laughing and did nothing to sell me so yeah sorry most love it you might love it i strongly dislike it  what i thought was a hilarious book turned one of the most boring books i have read this year with absolutely no purpose  i really tried very hard to push myself and see the light at the end of the tunnel with this book but it just kept going and going with random stories repetitive jokes and pathetic conversations all about men in a war with hardly any respect to anyone around them especially women  life is too short to spend reading  pages of nonsense unless this is your thing i didnt really hate it but the way these characters talk to each other also made me want to repeatedly bang my head against the wall until i pass out i read the first  pages for a book club i always planned on picking it back up to finish it but the idea was like finishing off leftovers that didnt taste good even before theyd sat in the back of the fridge for a week was i planning on finishing it because i genuinely wanted to find out how it continued or was i just trying to finish it out of dedication to the idea that this is a classic and therefore should be read i finally decided that there are too many books that i want to read to spend another second with one that annoyed me so much i couldnt even bring myself to drink good scotch while reading it  who wants to waste the good stuff on a bad mood id been advised that it gets better after the first  pages but the way i figure it really ought to start well if it wants to hold my attention sometimes you have an allergic reaction to a book and know from page  that its not going to work out such unfortunately was my experience of catch which has been on my reading list for as long as i can remember and which i fully expected to enjoy not so much a did not finish as a barely got started should i have stuck with it possibly although i find one of the upsides of being the wrong side of  is a greater decisiveness in abandoning books from which i am deriving no pleasure or other benefit lifes too short i know this book is a classic and im really hesitant to say i didnt like it but i didnt like it i grew up with so many great books and movies that were inspired by this approach everything from dr strangelove to mash but all that other stuff was so much better than this  i just absolutely hated yossarian i mean hes meant to be this brilliant rebellious antihero but he just comes across as another version of holden caulfield all snark and no action not once does he actually seem to register any actual human suffering its all around but he doesnt ever seem to feel anything i suppose the point is that too much combat numbs a man out but if he were really numbed out he wouldnt be making schoolboy wisecracks every other sentence and thats all they are really wisecracks without any real moral force or emotional depth i grew up watching hawkeye pierce on mash and week after week he made the same kind of remarks except he was usually in the or at the time saving some kids life while he talked about the insanity of war its really odd how the popular culture tv show was actually more complex and more involving than the literary classic  then there was the matter of natelys whore i mean come on natelys whore in norman mailers the naked and the dead half the men in recon platoon swear that they hate their wives and never want to go back to them but at least theyre honest theres so much nastiness in this book that has nothing to do with war and the author never even confronts it the only parallel i can think of to natelys whore is curlys wife in steinbecks of mice and men  i really hated this book and i was amazed at how empty it was give me the naked and the dead or slaughterhouse five any day catch by joseph heller was a crazy and confusing read once i figured out that the book was written by different characters point of view then i realized that there was indeed a timeline of events but you didnt see that until later in the book or the end because they werent written in chronological order it was very sarcastic and i often wondered if what was happening was really happening or if it was just part of the humor if youve ever heard the term catch  meaning a kind of nowin situation this is the book that coined the phrase interestingly enough it was originally named catch  but the author was asked to change it at the last minute because another book was coming out around the same time that had the number  in its title and he didnt want the two to be confused it went through many numbers before they finally decided on  this book was also often said to be one of the great literary works of the th century and im not sure why perhaps because it was set during world war ii and follows the imaginary squadron of yossarian our main character who is a bomber the whole book seems to be about how the government is one big catch  or contradiction of itself when talking about the term specifically he is learning that this clause applies to anyone wishing to leave the war it states that the most important trait of a soldier is his sanity if he is not sane he cant do his job to the best of his ability so if you want to get out of military service all you have to do is ask but only a crazy person would want to serve in the war so if you ask you are deemed most definitely sane therefore you can not get out of service therefore the ultimate catch  the book has these catch s in them some of the conversations i cant even follow because they seem to make no sense this is a book i will have to read again whether its deemed a classic or not yet well the jury is still out i simply dont have enough qualities to list to make it a classic the backwards type conversations that are held in the book remind me of the deep conversations we used to have back in college where a friend of mine jason always seemed to be the devils advocate taking the opposite side with the ability to talk until the wee hours of the morn without giving in whether or not he really believed in what he was saying this book reminds me of him so much that when i recently saw him at a wedding i called him yossarian all night i cant say that this should be a classic yet but ill reevaluate it again in the future when i have more of my classic definition formed i would recommend this book only because i am so curious to know what other people think of it please write me your thoughts if or when you read it what did you read catch  did you like it like what catch  what about it did you like it no i didnt care for it why did you read it if you didnt like it i wouldnt know i didnt like it until after i read it so you didnt dislike it while you read it no i disliked it then too then why did you keep reading it if you disliked it well i wouldnt be able to say i disliked it if i didnt finish it but you already disliked it while you were reading it what does that have to do with anything do you know why i brought you here in the first place what do you mean when you say you i mean you the person here besides me were not people were not people were not people then what are we identically voiced sentences that the author needs in order to get his point across well that sounds like a lot of effort for no gain to me youre telling me i read catch  you sure are clever you sure are bitter  there may be an actual review later who knows i cant say how much i hate this book i definitely acknowledge its cultural and literary significance which is why it gets two stars instead of one i appreciate that heller is a bit of a genius for the way his mind works and the style of his writing its quite unique and even impressive i value the themes in this book i too think war is insane i appreciate the realism of this book and especially that juxtaposed with the comedy but reading this book feels like reading a very repetitive and very long abbot and costello skit abbot and costello are funny but imagine watching whos on first for hours and hours and hoursas long as it takes you to read  pages i admit i didnt finish this book i have a page test for books if i get to  pages and im still in agony i stop wasting my time i just couldnt do it i think i really would have enjoyed this as a short story i can start with an apology for my many geek friends who read and loved the book i really wanted to love it i really tried to enjoy it but i think i might be too old for such a book a book that probably you can enjoy much more as a young  year old than a  thats the age where sarcasm and sophisticated humor makes you feel that you now understand the world and not a young naive person any more i am sure i could love it back then because of those reasons i have attempted to read this book on two separate occasions and only on the third succeeded to go through most of the book i didnt even understand what heller wants to say for a few tens of pages and when i did get it i was rather disappointed as people say it is not the book it is me but still  stars is rather generous in my opinion i loved this book in middle school i tried to reread it as an adult and couldnt get past the second page i completely hated the main character i was ok with him hiding out in a hospital so he wouldnt have to fight kind of but when he started to mess with the other gis mail when his job was to censor certain things then i got upset and stopped reading this is no longer a keeper for me i cant be sure but i think i first read this when i was  years old when i joined goodreads in  i added books to my read shelf ex post facto including this one which i rated as  stars upon rereading it ish years later the new me didnt care for hellers humor or viewpoint  i wanted to stop reading on many occasions either because i grew tired of the same joke or because the only reaction i could feel was a seething desire for revenge against the horrible characters which devolved into seething hatred for heller who couldnt allow any characters to want any kind of revenge every character is either pathologically passive or pathologically stupid or pathologically greedy or pathologically selfabsorbed or pathologically a combination of the aforementioned apparently hellerian fundamental traits  for most of the book i kept asking myself what is he parodying is this meant to reflect reality in any way at all and finally in the final or the penultimate or the antepenultimate or the preantepenultimate chapter it occurred to me that maybe hes trying to represent totalitarianism okay fine you still only get  stars from me joe  one for yossarian the syrian and one for chaplain tappman i wouldve preferred kaplan but   maybe ill watch a film version of it or try the new streaming show if its a fixed  of episodes just to see how they attempt to make this shit funny cuz the script in my head was decidedly unfunny really wanted to give this book a higher rating unfortunately in the end such a thing was not possible  catch has been sitting on my toread list for an exceptionally long time recently i started raiding the university library for classics i have yet to read dantes inferno was at the top of my list followed closely behind by catch i expected to get through catch much quicker than i worked through dantes inferno instead it took me almost three times as long to finish the book  dont get me wrong the book is not badly written there were a lot of things i enjoyed when it came to the writing style in fact if im honest a part of me had always feared this one was badly written what got to me was the way chronology seem to go out of the window and the fact that the madness was monotonous  ill start with my complaint regarding chronology as it is the shorter complaint  whilst the story was constantly moving towards a set point it was impossible to tell when certain events were taking place one moment people would be sitting in a hospital ward talking and the next moment they would be flying a plane on a mission there was no warning when this change in time was coming there was no way to tell when it was a flashback to earlier events these things were interesting to read but it was so unclear as to when in the storyline they were happening and i sometimes had to stop
The Scarlet Letter,another school book  updated i did read this in school but i was one of the kids who enjoyed the book hester is one of the first stories about a real outcast from her society she had to be strong and pay the price for her partner as well i think this is a great story about a strict society and how they dont work people are different and life happens and we have to be able to allow for mistakes and variations  the world we live in is about variation there isnt one type of ant or beetle but like  thousand variations there isnt simply an oak or maple but many variations on the oak the world loves differences as we see all around us some reason society usually tries to put rules in place for people to make us all the same and we arent all the same i think i read this in th grade and it sort of opened my eyes to the different types of stories out there i was not an advanced reader as a child so this was eyeopening i actually enjoyed most of the stories we read in school accept for hemingway and steinbeck i didnt care for any of their stuff but i always enjoyed the discussion  thats why i loved english i loved discussing the stories with people about what was going on hester lived in some hard times they are roots in america that are still around and part of what has our country so divided anyway i think this is a great story and i should reread it now that i understand more and have more life experience let me start my review by stating that im guilty and should wear a big p for preoccupied on my chest i mentioned in a previous review that i was worried that if i wasnt in the right state of mind and in an adequate setting i wouldnt be able to enjoy dickenss great expectations  turned out it wasnt the case i never expected that for the scarlet letter but this might be one of the reasons i didnt enjoy the book that much and rated it  stars i was in the middle of preparations to move in to a new place and had tons of decisions to make and wanted to solve everything as soon as possible so maybe this is the type of book that you need to get into a proper mood and mind state to really enjoy  as it has such a different and unique atmosphere to be completely fair though i started the odyssey around the same time and had no trouble concentrating and isolating lifes questions while i was reading all about ulysses  that isnt to say i didnt enjoy  or couldnt recognize  particular positive aspects of this book its a very interesting study of how people with their morals can be impacted by sin and guilt  especially when in a very puritan society the scenes where hester and arthur meet in the woods and are finally alone are beautifully written and we finally get to see a glimpse of the love that put them in severe penitence  speaking of that i simply cant wrap my head around the fact that hester  a married woman whose husband is long gone is sentenced to wear the letter a stands for adultery sewn to her clothes on her bosom to be publicly and constantly humiliated  didnt simply decide to leave new england for good with her daughter it doesnt make sense to me that she would agree to such a thing and raise her daughter in that unsound  to say the least  environment  the highlight for me is centered around reverend arthur dimmesdales inner conflict its greatly enticing to witness how a secret  and the guilt that revolved it  so well hidden would inflict on a physical wound not to mention the religion vs sin debacle the fact that arthur was so strongly devoted to his god and his principles that a spiritual disease would eventually lead to serious consequences and turn out to be his demise is  simply put  a very rich topic to write and think about  in the books conclusion we learn that hester after being away for some time  which again is what she shouldve done since the opening scene  is back and wearing the scarlet letter on her bosom again  but there was a more real life for hester prynne here in new england than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home here had been her sin here her sorrow and here was yet to be her penitence she had returned therefore and resumedof her own free will for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed itresumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale never afterwards did it quit her bosom  although i can admire the authors beautiful words i still cant understand or relate to hesters reasons i cant help but wish that hawthorne had put hester pryne under the same lights james used while painting isabel archers portrait  a wordy treatise on the aftermath of adultery on the couple who committed the sincrime in the theocracy that was massachusetts in the mids the scarlet letter is interesting and im glad i read it but i didnt care for it overmuch one reason for that is the vagueness of hawthornes theme are we to believe in witches for he includes one in the story who doesnt hide her allegiance to the devil are hester and her lover and especially little pearl supposed to be the living embodiment of evil it seems that pearl is because he describes her thus time and time again if that is the case i am glad that thoughts have changed on that issue at least i suppose the puritans didnt believe in forgiveness or redemption or weakness their will was to enforce divine law and they did their duty what a dour book so bleak at least it ends on a bit of an uplift th book of  artist for this review is french painter hugues merle hawthorne considered his painting the scarlet letter as the finest illustration of his novel   a fine novel that starts off very well hawthorne is a great writer better than i was expecting but as the plot went on i found his prose did become overworked and dense reminiscent of henry james the scarlet letter is often lauded as a strong candidate for the great american novel the phrase was coined in  by john william de forest interestingly forest didnt consider the scarlet letter as being a contender but it is now regarded as one of the most famous ones i dont see why personally it is not a bad novel but compared to some of the other candidates from the century like moby dick and the adventures of huckleberry finn it pales for me the latter is still the gan of the thc  description the scarlet letter  a lot of people have read this due to studying it at school i never did and have been meaning to read it for a long time the novel is mostly centred around the themes of sin and redemption it is set in puritan boston in the s but published in  and concerns hester prynne who conceives a child through an affair and is forced to wear a scarlet letter a on her chest for adultery there are two men entwined into her story in different ways which i wont reveal but they are painted into the background of merles painting above prynnes daughter pearl grows up throughout the course of the novel till the age of about  she is a great little character an elvish child that some of the townspeople presume as some sort of devilchild there are also witches and the idea of witchcraft crops up now and again due to the novels time period  though the novel tackles some interesting themes i didnt find it tackled as many as some of the other gan novels nor particularly representative of america as i think huckleberry finn is certainly it is somewhat but i agree with forests original verdict a good novel but not a potential contender in my eyes ignoring its gan status it is a strong thc novel with a good plot climbing towards redemption a worthwhile read at least difficult as it is to come to an acceptable idea of existence it is interesting to study the social evolution of mankind in terms of ethics values and morals held or dogmas followed it helps to gain some coherence when coming to terms with the understanding of the rules of the society we make a part of more importantly to question certain unreasonable dogmas and beliefs while still considering the sensitive nuances forming the very fabric of society the contemplation which so verily stimulates the mind to question also makes it ponder upon the beliefs which we may follow unconsciously only because our minds are conditioned for them beliefs which may not hold much significance if viewed objectively but still influence options considered or decisions made in life  a reading of the scarlet letter accompanied such contemplation much as there was to think about the beliefs and dogmas that prevailed in a puritan society the punishment indicted upon hester or the revenge sought by chillingworth what troubled me more was the idea of sacrifice as portrayed which made the characters somehow larger than life and hence alienated hesters devotion to dimmesdale the clergyman was contradicted by her decision to stay back at the same place it was quite understandable in the beginning only that her presence would be unfortunate for him her character though she being the protagonist was not as explored as were the characters of chillingworth or that of clergyman in the sense that we had little idea about how she felt about being adjudged as an adulterous woman or why she decided to stay back in the same place though she is presented as an admirably strong woman who walks with her head high and adorns her child in the best possible manner it is puzzling that she lacks foresight  what the character of hester lacked was explored and portrayed at length in her daughter pearls character she was sensitive impulsive and instinctive and seemed to possess more clarity dimmesdales character is the one fully explored and somehow to me it is also the weakest character in the story as a clergyman dedicated to divine intervention and religion he is the one who is pretentious his decision to stay silent and let hester bear the punishment even if for the purpose of remaining true to his position and not ruining peoples faith while tormenting himself is incongruous with the very ideals he seem to be advocating or protecting and though we witness a hint of malevolence in him towards the end when he feels tempted by the prospect of going far away with hester he is redeemed in the end by his confession by his acceptance of hester and pearl and by taking up the scarlet letter himself  i couldnt understand the authors intention here though did he just attempt to portray a true event or did he mock the hypocrisy of a so called puritan society  either way the work did succeed in making the mind deliberate upon human nature and upon the extent to which societal beliefs impact the choices made by an individual when i read this as a teen growing up in liberal s san francisco its points about hypocrisy and morality seemed obvious and outdated unfortunately it now seems relevant again i guess thats what makes for a timeless classic a religiouschristian psychodrama concerned with guilt sin redemption this gets very fevered at times with first pearl and then chillingworth being associated with the devil  there are interesting secular themes too about identity forms of authority and the individual vs society but gosh hawthorne is heavyhanded with his symbolism  from the scarlet letter itself which has multiple manifestations and interpretations to inyourface instances of meteors beams of sunshine and roses hawthorne is constantly beating us over the head to make sure we get his figurative subtexts slightly more subtle are visions of pearl flirting with her reflection in a stream echoing both ovids narcissus and miltons eve  i feel like the scarlet letter just kind of bounced off of me i liked it without ever really connecting to it i often have strong opinions about well just about anything i read in this case not so much although there have been other classics that ive felt at a loss to explain my reaction to  note the rest of this review has been withheld due to the recent changes in goodreads policy and enforcement you can read why i came to this decision here i didnt quite know what to expect from this book but probably not exactly what i found i guess i expected it to be a much more powerful story  this is a very interesting story idea the entire book begins at an extraordinary moment when we see the effects of events that took place before hester is punished interestingly we are not going back to what led to the current situation at all we will never know how the feeling between her and the young pastor arose for most of the book we dont really know if they really were in love or if it was just an impulse one moment  some aspects of this book have gotten so old they are practically incomprehensible for example i did not always fully understand the behavior of hester who on the one hand bears her punishment with dignity somewhat in defiance of the people of the city and on the other hand she selfflagellates herself and believes that her punishment is justified because she has sinned i didnt think i understood pearls symbolism either was the girl supposed to be evil at least a bit because she was born of sin it is not at all clear to me i dont think this book has aged very well  i also wonder if i understood the message of this book i think that the symbolism sometimes went too far and everything was a little chaotic philosophical considerations about morality did not always reach me  but most of all i think this is one of those stories that i will totally forget soon i wont be able to remember what the book was about nothing made such a strong impression on me that i would remember it this would be the first book this year ive read with my own two eyeballs instead of going with the audiobook and i honestly regret it my brain now hurts in my opinion the writing style destroyed this one i found myself skimming through paragraphs just wishing the torture would end and its a shame because otherwise it couldve been a good one  stars  i did quite enjoy this story and most of the characters however i didnt enjoy the writing it seem to meander around a scene would start to get interesting and then the narrator would go in depth describing the philosophical meaning of what the characters were feelingdoing i love philosophy but in my opinion it shouldnt be told to you its something for you to think on and discover for yourself  i think it was rather predictable who was who it is only a short novel and so doesnt have a lot of time to keep secrets for long i loved the themes of redemption and love of how sometimes we will punish ourselves far more harshly than any criminal punishment will hester is i think a brave and strong woman to takes the scarlet letter and her shame and ends up wearing it with pride even though she is ostracised she doesnt let it spoil her good nature she is still charitable and she helps everyone she can this pays off for her as it means she can work as a seamstress which pays for all the she and pearl need i think it also speaks for her character that she doesnt tell anyone who the man was with whom she had an affair i think that she knew what sort of hardship that will bring about on the man and as the reader is aware the father of hesters baby is suffering probably far more than hester he is punishing himself for his sins  so yeah it was the writing that let this down for me still very glad i read it and im curious about watching an adaptation of it there is a whole passel of exceptionally invigorating and deftly executed personal drama of the family variety and of the social criticism variety and also of the examination of the role of religion variety and yet the long sentences  quite appropriate for the writing style of the time and also includes heavy use of adverbs  made it grievously difficult for me to maintain longterm interest and also had a tendency to confound my person unless i was paying absolute strict unwavering attention to each syllable uttered in the newfangled contraption known as an audiobook  its a very good story but im giving an honest review on my reading experience it was hard to get through i see why it is a classic its definitely worth the read especially for writers who want to understand how language can change which should give said writers more freedom in exploring their visions of narrative  as for the story itself theres a lot going on adultery a child born out of wedlock palace intrigue true love the endurance of the human spirit and a hardcore loyalty that is its own reward not requiring reciprocation from the target of that loyalty this is so far removed from the current american experience it reads like a fantasy novel even though the story of hester pryne might be based on the reallife example of mary bailey beadle of kittery maine who was convicted of adultery in the s home girl received  lashes she was whipped and was branded with the letter a  branded dude  thats some grrm shit right there puritans were extremely strict repressive bunch the scarlet letter gave me a snapshot of how far womens rights have come on our culture the scarlet letter depicts the dynamics of guilt and shame in seventeenth century massachusetts bay colonys puritan society but we may find similar forces in communities where established social norms direct members behavior  hester prynne has to wear the scarlet letter a a symbol of shame for committing adultery the town fathers seek to enforce the puritanical code through shame and alienation from the community yet grounded in her identity hester stands tall and calm on the scaffold and refuses to acknowledge the power of the town fathers or of the social norm throughout the novel we see her directing her destiny helping the sick and the poor seeking to leave boston with her lover returning from europe wearing the scarlet letter not as a symbol of shame but one of defiance  massachusetts bay colony massachusetts bay colony  on the other hand her lover the minister arthur dimmesdale avoids shame because hester refuses to name him but guilt torments him so much that his health deteriorates his guilt may have come from having an affair with hester though her husband is presumed dead or from allowing her to suffer alone whatever the reason the same power that hester refuses to acknowledge crushes and ultimately destroys him so while hester embodies shame without guilt arthur does guilt without shame he has internalized the puritanical system such that internal punishments may exceed any external ones  the contrast between hester prynne and arthur dimmesdale is an interesting study in human character while some in society respond more to external punishments other avoid transgressions for fear of internal ones  salem witch trials salem witch trials  the massachusetts bay colony like other communities uses both external and internal forces to direct behaviors but one problem comes from government merging with religion and the legal code besides protecting individual rights enforces morality laws and punishments curtail behavior and therefore have vital roles in society but they cannot create good people whenever we force people to be good the result is either conformity or rebellion not goodness  nathaniel hawthorne nathaniel hawthorne  another problem though hesters husband is presumed dead the town fathers punish her for having an affair and consider it adultery because she is legally married to him and she probably couldnt get a divorce so here the legal code traps wives whose husbands have passed away and they become widows for life so legalism can be dangerous i know that the scarlet letter is considered a timeless classic and that most of my friends have read it ages ago i finally picked it up as part of the  popsugar reading challenge for me it qualifies as a book at least  years older than you but it might as well count for a book you were supposed to read in high school but didnt that was one of last years categories now that i am revisiting this book i understand why my teenage self couldnt stomach the tale hawthorne is superfluous in his descriptions which makes the book tedious to read just see the amusing review that sarah wrote here  as an adult however i have more appreciation for the moral behind the story it is not a mere cautionary tale about the punishment for sin but more so stresses confession and forgiveness indeed he that buried the secret paid a far higher price than hester prynn the sainted minister in the church the woman of the scarlet letter in the market place what imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both  nathaniel hawthorne has intended to designate the mood settings and the people of the story so so much gloomy to make us realize and repent the gloom and depression of the sin of the characters as we are the sinner to have the burden of something heavy for many years and to feel relieved when it is taken off of you so it is preferred to be read fast the atmosphere will drag you into the wood and it doesnt matter if it is the wood of new england only i fully expected to hate this book the way i do with literally all the classics i have to read for uni but this was surprisingly entertaining and i loved hester as a character  the only thing that bugged me was the writing style ahh it was sooo hard to get into the book and focus on what i was reading because the writing was so dense and all over the place if english isnt your first language id definitely recommend listening to the audiobook while reading bc that makes it a lot easier hawthorne writes a strange novel his introduction is  pages long in which he attempts to denigrate his family who helped hang the women at the salem witch trials while acknowledging that he loves the inherited fortune from the same relatives you would think that any novel he wrote would have nothing to do with witchcraft but the doctor is satan and has a child possessed the ending is so convoluted that he actually gives you  scenarios on what the ending means the first time i read the scarlet letter was in high school so when i found the book randomly one day i realized it has been a while since ive read it i also wanted to see if my opinion on the book would change of course when i was younger i didnt like the book because how often do you end up liking a book school makes you read its a rare ass chance guys  this book follows the life of hester prynne its set in a town of boston around the th century and she is being publicly disgraced for committing adultery she has also given birth to a illegitimate child named pearl hester now has to wear a scarlet a so that everyone knows what she did  now while reading this i remember on why it frustrated me so much i didnt get the big deal about what she did but thats probably due to the fact that the situation is kind of common now not so much back then but today its like a random ass tuesday thing also this book reminded me of that movie easy a  weird i know to compare a movie to this book but it just reminded me of that movie  honestly i felt bad for hester i hated how she was treated for what she did shes human and people make mistakes every day i envied her because of how strong of a person she became out of this whole thing i loved that she didnt let other peoples opinions push her into a deep dark depression she was a strong and independent woman the entire time good for her  overall this book was good and it still frustrates me to this day  stars  meh it was okay but definitely not something ill revisit im not gonna lie manys the time during my experience of this fairly short book i thought too many words hawthorne if there are  different ways to express some emotion hawthorne is going to use them all and then repeat them in the next chapterand the next also i agree with my sister the prologue is a huge yawn and nearly put me off the book  despite my occasional struggles with this verbose book i liked it because it was pretty forward thinking for its time in fact i would argue for many it would still be considered forward thinking and it was wonderfully gothic with lots of supernatural elements that i did not expect that at all witches and devils imps and scarlet letters burning in the sky  and i loved pearl she reminded me of the little girl character from the movie the piano i also really liked how it was intimated that she represented in her person and character all that her mother could no longer outwardly express the living embodiment of hesters shame but also her refutation of that shame  stars not going to lie this is probably the first book i have ever actually read and finished for school i enjoyed it for the most part but i would not have understood it if mrs graham hadnt stopped to explain it terrible male characters i wasnt forced to read this in high school unlike most other teenagers in america and im glad because i would have hated to write an essay on this the story in and of itself is interesting and this along with the characters of hester and pearl were the main things that kept me reading this book the connection between hester chillingworth and dimmesdale are made apparent from the beginning of the story so there is not even that mystery to keep you interested however there are some very wellwritten passages that i appreciated and hawthorne does a good job of illustrating the various ways people deal with their sin i do not believe it should continue to be required reading in high schools though there is no special message or life lesson taught in here that could not easily be translated through some other more captivating medium  i found this very difficult to get into it takes about  pages until any sort of plot starts to unfold anytime there was dialogue i found the novel engaging and whenever there was pages of description my eyes glazed over overall a classic im glad i picked up but not one i was entertained by for the most part powerful book rich in symbolism and critique but would it kill nathaniel hawthorne to be more concise i read this book because my english teacher adored this book and i really liked her as teacher im happy this was never required reading in finland i dont think i would have been able to finish this and like this as much as i did i seriously dont get the whole required reading thinking i also get why many people hate this book  i liked the use of thee  and thou and thyself it was like reading shakespeare i also liked how hawthorne wrote hester and pearl setting was interesting th century massachusetts  puritan society sort of gothic atmosphere this was so much better than i expected it to be and im so glad i got to read it the story is really captivating and there are so many interesting characters that just seem so real and raw  i was pretty hooked and thoroughly enjoyed this book however at parts it was a little slow and confusing particularly with the chapters that werent based on hester  it was a good book and i can clearly see why it is considered a classic today yes i had to blast white noise to even attempt to focus on the words but ms elfchild pearl and hesters little rage moments made it bearable  update after watching a few video essays i realized that i was really just frustrated with the slow pace and language so i am adding one star  hester is a girl boss and doesnt shy away from male judgement she makes her own decisions and sticks to them which i really respect i am glad i was not required to read this for my english class because i think i would have enjoyed it a lot less but i am still glad that i read it public shaming before social media puritan style classic novels often blow me away but not this one i dont get the hoopla
Macbeth,least favourite so far i was lucky enough to find an oxford version at the charity store  with further annotations by someone studying the text so it was good to read there were parts i liked little bits of insight and metaphors about the human psyche and condition but other than that i didnt really like or connect with the story like othello its about darkness creeping in in the aftermath of the trauma of war in a mans psychelife and the following consequences but it was far less interesting as a remote supernatural dark force screwing with macbeths fate the weird sisters instead of the interesting dynamic with and personality of iago and unlike othello macbeth really had nothing going for him no noble or good characteristics that we can see that were overrun there was no reason to empathise with him or his wife in their demise   super fast review sigh im actually kinda disappointed not with the book but with myself the story and tone in this are very interesting to me but goddamn i cannot get into shakespeares writing style at all it might be that his work is so old so a lot of the dialogue and storytelling dont translate well with me in  so yeah probably would have liked it but the writing doesnt click or connect with me to the point that it slightly ruins it for me  when you are reading a play its nice to actually be able to read it not have a teacher explain it to you or see actors attempt to explain their roles and most definately not study it for hours on end  when you are studying a play its nice to have a break once in a while not to listen to the teachers opinions or discuss it with other clueless students and most definately not write essays for weeks on end  when you are watching a play its nice to see it played out before you not to watch it retold on the tv or watch students fail to create a scottish accent and most definately not look into other scenes for no apparent reason  studied for year ten hated since month two macbeth a play in two halves or my copy at least i will simply have to accept the fact that shakespeares plays are not for me it either goes over my head or i fall asleep or both or i just start skimming without actually taking anything in  im trying people but i guess i need to try some other classics to hopefully fall in love with because this isnt working at all compared to hamlet this book is such a disappointment its dark and bloody hamlet had character and was humorous recording myself being an s british witch has to be some type of core memory this book was super dumb why cant shakespeare just talk normal he really is doing too much the ending was stupid and i kinda hated it lady macbeth was a girlboss tho i loved her so thats why its  stars now lets just hope my grade doesnt go down in english when i take the macbeth test short and quick review from memory before i reread and rereview at a later date  all i know of macbeth is what the world knows in general will be an interest reread consider my recent rediscovery of shakespeare and a love for him rekindled i read this for an assignment and also acted in a production using this as the very script but i wasnt a big fan  while i found the themes to be thoughtprovoking the scenes were very dark and i pretty much hated all the charactersthey were either victims of murder murderers or drunk  while i probably wont be reading this again anytime soon i do have respect for the author despite his works not really being my favorite  this book was okay it isnt the best in my opinion but that is probably because i had to read it in english at school the old english was annoying but luckily my english teacher was able to make us a version which was translated to go alongside it the ending was kind of quick to be honest and the start dragged on but i mean its a very popular book and was written a few centuries ago so the book does deserve some credit i guess i read the original play a modern translation for a better understanding and i even listened to the audio play with an entire cast speaking the different roles and still i couldnt really get into it  i heard macbeth is dark and cruel and full of suspense yet while reading the original play i felt utterly confused and just bored most of the time for me the whole play felt rushed shakespeare introduces important characters and kills them off silently and offstage mentioning their death in one sentence the whole play felt hastened to me but maybe thats just his writing style i cant really say i have never read anything from shakespeare before  if you read this in  when it came out it probably was amazing and blew your mind but now with epic and emotional storylines around every corner tv shows movies and even in games its pretty pale in comparison i know its a classic but thats how it felt for me i read lots of plays this year and almost all of them were more gripping than this one  i guess what makes it so hard for me to like this play is that almost everyone in macbeth is unlikeable i always need a character i can relate to someone i can empathize with or look up to i have a strong sense of justice and therefore macbeth madness resulting in pointless murdering women and children got on my nerves  i often read that lady macbeth is the real villain in this play not her husband i dont agree with that yes she is a poisonous snake powerobsessed and tells macbeth to do all kinds of terrible things while she herself drugged some guards and even threatened to kill the king herself if macbeth is too much a coward to do it  but macbeth is a grown man he can think and act on his own of course this makes her cruel evil and manipulative but she was just a voice whispering these things into her hubsands ears macbeth ultimately did all of the atrocities on his own i believe everyone has a choice and he chose to follow the dark path  im not sure if i would recommend reading the play but what i definitely recommend is listening to the almost  hours long audio play it was much more detailed than shakespeares play while not changing anything important and therefore much darker definitely more disturbing and it also didnt feel so hastened well this was very interesting interesting as in it was very odd  im thankful i only had to read the play version and not the real book i couldnt find the play version on gr so i had to add this one the one i read only had  pages not  and some sighs with relief  so how did i like it ha i didnt really like it at all and i dont plan on reading it again i understood two sentences this morning when i was finishing it a miracle or what d give me my armor and my names macbeth d  storyline  its about the sin of macbeth who murdered someone and it falls heavily on him in the end i understood what shakespeare was trying to get out i just didnt understand what everyone was saying d  content nothing gory it did mention in the last scene that malcolm brings in macbeths head after macbeth was killed  so two stars i know other people might enjoy reading shakespeares works but i really dont enjoy them i think i got more about of julius caesar than i did macbeth but even then i didnt d  side note my essay for it is going to be miserable  i dont even know what im going to say d coughs it would have been really cool to see it as a play and i enjoyed watching the movie but its just not the same reading it i really wanted there to be an alternate ending where lady macbeth ends up killing macbeth because her ambition was greater than her husbands that would have been awesome if only shakespeare was a hardcore feminist the story was okay i think i had trouble understanding it and needed help from a website i dont know why when i understood a midsummer nights dream perfectly hmm maybe dont start with this one when you havent read any of his plays yet i read this at the beginning of the school year for my english class simply because it was a requirement usually i would not write reviews for the books i read for school however since i did write harsh reviews for my mandatory summer reading novels i thought i would write another bitter review im going to be raw i found this annoying and overall bland i will never understand the extraordinarily astounding and marvelous connotation surrounding shakespeares books i find his work quite exhausting the only reason i am giving it two stars is because lady macbeth is ambitious truly insane and the queen of manipulation okay second time lucky i tried the audiobook instead and i managed to finish it at least but i still had no idea what was going on my brain is too tiny for this i was confused  of the time but im glad to know that the what you egg is from macbeth because its the funniest thing ever i had to read this book for education purposes and i have to admit my vocabulary is not advanced enough for me to thoroughly understand this book i started it in late  and finished it sometime in january  read this but a shorter version  and well explained version for school last year but i sort of liked itsort of didnt kinda hated it bruh no i have to write an essay onthis  overall everyone in this play needs to shuteththefuckethup   shakespeares irony is always top notch though   read for english class  better than i expected it shouldve been called melodramatic macbeth i had to read this for school and could honestly barely understand the writing it was very confusing but we had to write a group essay on either a character or theme and my group chose lady macbeth as a character and i wrote a psychoanalysis for my portion of the essay and it was actually really fun probably a sign that im majoring in the wrong subject but i find shakespeare sooo exhausting to read so i kinda struggled my way thru it but i perservered it was okay i didnt really find this one interesting but im taking a shakespeares tragedies course at the uni with the best teacher ever who explains things wonderfully and his enthusiasm about anything shakespeare is just so contagious i wish more teachers were like this he even made shakespeares histories cool so when reading this play on my own id give it  stars but after the lectures of my amazing teacher id go to  or so what a difference one man can make my favorite character was macduff the line tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day had me reciting all of hamilton reading shakespeare makes me feel sophisticated even if i had to translate everything and lady macbeth is a girlboss thank you for coming to my tedtalk much better than rj shakespeare can definitely write but the stories themselves are only decent apologies to all my shakespeare fans out there but this just didnt quite do it for me im afraid   i liked the witches i appreciated some of the language and imagery and i enjoyed the setting but i didnt much care for the revenge power and guiltcentric narrative  that being said i did find the witches loopholey prophecy to be a pretty neat plot device on the other hand i found malcolms whole im an abject sinner oh no but wait actually i was testing you and im as virtuous as they come shtick really freaking clunky like what was up with that  at the end of the day this had one big thing working against it for me im just not a fan of reading plays never have been id much rather see a play performed on stage plus i also feel like i really shouldve encountered shakespeare in an academic setting kind of like i did with molire racine and corneille it doesnt necessarily mean i wouldve liked it more as such but i believe it wouldve made for a more engaging experience than to just apprehend it like this in a pretty cold and outoftheblue fashion on my own time i mean sort of i did read this because of my significant other so its somewhat special in that sense  thankfully my edition of the play provided a decently interesting introduction and id already watched a  movie adaptation of the play which gave me some additional context and visual reference points anecdotally i didnt really like the movie either but i actually appreciate it more in retrospect now that ive read the original source material so theres a strong chance i might really enjoy a live performance of the play some time in the future if youre under the impression that this is a feel good story you have been misinformed its not not at all theres regicide murder witches murder suspicion murder power and must i say it again even more murder overall i found the play quite depressing dark and twisted the ending although kind of what you are supposed to want is gruesome and just plain terrible hint it has something to do with a head the only redeeming quality to macbeth are the questions that it brings to the table who can rule perfectly and justly who can overcome greed and natural human nature the answer no one these are also depressing themes but true nevertheless not that im judging shakespeare or anything hes a great writer probably the best of all time but i feel as if he could have drawn out that point a bit more at one point in the play a son of the murdered king and a nobleman are discussing these points and come to the same conclusion that i came to that no one with an inherently selfish human nature everyone can rule with utmost selfless efforts but the play ended with the son claiming the throne which i feel totally undermines all of the previous conversations anyway i dont enjoy rating books poorly but sometimes there are just notsofunandhappy books to read like this one i recommend to all those who have this play as required reading and to lovers of dark twisted literature
"Twilight (The Twilight Saga, #1)",it turns out we dont need dr john gray to tell us that men are from transylvania and women are from venus we just need to read stephenie meyer books for example from this book we learn that the millions of women who have wolfed down the twilight series pun intended want men who   talk about their feelings either meyers husband is the singlemost communicative male on the planet and she doesnt realize how unusual he is or she like most of her female readers is using her fiction to imagine a world where men not only have deep emotions but want to admit to having them and talk about them over and over articulating even the most subtle of their internal dramas   make them flutter but just being a sensitive newage kind of guy doesnt cut it a man has to be hardbodied chiseled dashing and have eyes that pierce the soul if not the skin even as they never look at your chest this book suggests that a real man makes you constantly stumble over your words bite your lip to refrain from exclaiming adulations and lose yourself in the sweet smell of his breath   are fiercely devoted that a girl of no spectacular beauty who lacks any trace of conversation skills  whose only virtue is that she smells really yummy  can inspire an immortal creature of godlike power and grace to alter his entire existence to serve and protect her watching over her by night more on that in  this is a womans ultimate fantasy  to have the perfect man perfectly devoted for no good reason at all   want them so bad that they wont take them this alas is the most transparent aspect of this books appeal it speaks volumes about the differences between men and women to have so many women toss their bodiceripping romances aside in order to read how a feral man with otherworldly physical desires can contain his passion and lust out of his pure and perfect love for his beloved it says that women really do wish they could have it both ways to be an object of lust and devotion at once to fulfill a mans desire without actually slaking his thirst for her to have a man watch you sleep and not want to have even a little peek under the covers  now thats hot fantasy for todays woman who is otherwise told on a regular basis that to be her best self she has to enage in casual and risky sexual behavior  to see just what an indulgent fantasy this book is just imagine the malecentric version of twilight in which a troubled teen boy moves to a small town to find the hottest girl in town is a vampiress such a book would be about  pages long all the unnecessary internal dialogue would be removed no one would talk except to comment on the awesome size of um ones videogame library the vampiress would be simple relatively dumb incredibly hot wearing almost nothing and with no expectations of her man but drawn to him only by the smell of his gym bag she wouldnt hold herself back from trying to bite her intended but would get so distracted with his bedroom technique that she would never get around to it  we would laugh at such a book in fact we know it would never be a book since men dont read it would be a movie and it would be a smash summer hit called american vampieer ill start the screenplay right away somehow when this story is told in a similarly indulgent femalecentric vein we dont reject it but sympathize with it i believe this is because women get to indulge in their fantasies so rarely outside of jane austen novels while men are surrounded with theirs so far i have yet see spam email inviting one to read hot things devoted husbands would say to their wives or see pictures of hunks promising not to get nasty out of respect for their women or buy this purple pill so you can stay up late and share your feelings  seven times in one night so hats off to stephenie meyer for figuring out what it is that women really want and giving it to them i actually had to give this book three separate reviews by three sides of my personality my threestar rating is the median of the three  review  by my inner fifteen year old girl  stars bella is smart funny wellread pretty and yet misunderstood by most of her peers just like me then she meets a cool hot guy who turns out to be a good vampire and he can do really cool things like run fast and stop cars with his hands but hes still sweet and wonderful its ultimate wishfulfillment fantasy  whats not to like meyers can make your heart speed up with some of the tense tortured we must be togetherno what if i hurt you pg erotica  review  by my fan of ya lit  stars meyers can tell a pretty good story when she lets herself actually tell it  the book starts out well and would have been a bit more interesting if i hadnt known he was a vampire all along then it slows down during the long getting to know you dialogue exchanges between edward and bella  theres no plot just backstory and exposition disguised as conversations and far too many i cant be with you i dont want to hurt you but i love you i dont care about danger backandforths when the evil vamps show up however the story kicks back in and the end is quite exciting when meyers isnt dwelling on how perfectly angelic edward is again she can get the pages turning since there are a lot of pages to turn i wish she would have infused that urgency into the story more often while abandoning most of the conventional cliches of vampirelore stakes sunlight garlic coffins she keeps all the modernvampromance cliches alabaster skin good hair expensive taste in clothes tragically distant and adds a few of her own unfortunate twists vampires avoid the sun because it makes them sparkle the goodvamp clan play some extreme version of baseball in a scene that was far too quidichy for my taste too many cliches or trying to hard to be original  somehow both criticisms are accurate  review  by my inner feminist  star meyers describes bella as being strong brave and independent but then shows her as a spineless cowering victim who needs to be saved by her violently jealous and overprotective boyfriend she constantly goes on and on about how edward is perfect at everything and how hes so gorgeous and she is so unworthy of him how hes so strong and he protects her in fact she never gives any reason for liking him other than how hot he is but thats fair because edward never gives a reason for liking her other than she smells good he is frustrated that bella is the only person whose thoughts he cant read so he eavesdrops on her friends minds to find out what they talk about he follows her whenever she leaves her house and he secretly camps outside her room when she sleeps  that doesnt sound sweet it sounds creepy if girls want a romantic conflicted vampirehuman romance they should go watch the firs three seasons of buffy  not only is there the dark mysterious conflicted vampire but the girl hes in love with can kick some serious ass all on her own twilight drinking game  take a sip every time  edward smiles crookedly  bella trips on something  a random guy is jealous of another random guy bella is talking to  edward has a wicked glint in his eye  bella says shes not hungry  take a shot every time  you wonder whether this town is suffering from a womenonly pandemic or general shortage of women just because at least that would explain the lowgrade tsunami of high school students constantly flooding bellas proverbial dms  edward refers to bella the person he is lusting after so intently that his boners are setting off earthquake detectors as a child  theres that relatable moment when your crush is like hey im probably going to kill you  and youre like omg thats so sad for you to have to deal with that  realizing i typed drinking game above when i meant to say way to get alcohol poisoning within  pages autocorrect  the good news is that you dont even have to be zonked beyond human comprehension to have fun with this book  it justis fun  even as its problematic  even as its poorly written  even as its kind of unoriginal and not wellcharacterized and generally lacking in all those areas that tend to make books good  this is simply never not fun  i wish i could lie and say its unpleasant i wish i could pretend to be better than this book and unsusceptible to its charm and genuinely exist at superhuman levels of judgment and clarity and coolness as per usual  but i am honest above all and this is a fun read sorry take it up with the bad book justice system  bottom line im not proud  oh boy i know this is probably not a review that most of you expected to see pop up on my blog and honestly i almost didnt even review this because there are a million and one reviews in the world for each book in this series and this was at least my eighth or ninth time rereading this however it was my first time reading it in ten years and i had a lot of unexpected feelings about it so here we are  and so the lion fell in love with the lamb he murmured what a stupid lamb i sighed what a sick masochistic lion  okay first of all you guys i gotta be honestthis book is still just as cringey as i remembered it being the instalove is so real bella has major notlikeothergirls syndrome and some of edwards behaviors are downright terrifying all of this is on top of how incredibly awkward most of the cullens are how ridiculously stereotypical some of the native rep is and the fact that the writing is just not up to par with what im used to reading these days  i decided as long as im going to hell i might as well do it thoroughly  all of that aside i had a freaking blast rereading this i laughed my ass off at so many points i awwed over little cinnamon roll jacob all over again teamjacob for life yall i rolled my eyes at  of edwards dialogue and i grew seriously concerned for the level of clumsiness bella withholds i mean if your claims to have fallen down two flights of stairs and through a window just sounds like an average friday night to your family well  what if im not a superhero what if im the bad guy  this is where my struggle to rate this comes in though if i were reading this for the first time right now itd probably be a star read its fun enough to be worth more than  but problematic and ridiculous enough not to warrant  either as an og twihard rereading these just for the fun of it at a point in my life where i no longer let people give me hell for the things i like this was so much fun and i legitimately cant wait to continue rereading the series so well say a star rating rounded up eh  do i dazzle you  so if youre wondering if i recommend this title it depends if its going to be your first time reading the series eh you could probably live without it if you were an oldschool fan though go into this with a grain of salt the size of a buick and understand that no its not going to hold up to todays ya literature but yes i think youll be happy you did it dear god this was hard to get through while fairly entertaining the writing is objectively not great and bella is one of the most insufferable characters i have ever witnessed seriously she is a terrible friend and daughter and everything that she said or thought had me so annoyed she continuously wonders why edward is obsessed with her because shes so as she proclaims over and over again ordinary and bland and honestly im wondering the same thing edward whats up with that also miss stephanie meyer did too much with the whole im so clumsy thing like we get it bella is uncoordinated with that being said the book is less confusing than the movie the chemistry is somewhat better and i enjoyed reading the first half even though i knew what was going to happen its also deeply iconic so it gets another star for that alone i wont be reading the rest of the series but this was a niceexperiment  october    instagram  twitter  facebook  amazon  pinterest   edit typo      read for the unapologetic romance readers halloween  reading challenge for the category of a romance about vampires     this is the one romance book that many men have deigned to pick up even if just to look at the cover and sneer and is frequently used as the scapegoat example to bemoan the romance genre as a whole as being a tasteless wonderland for idiots without brain cells ie women because as you might have noticed anything that is marketed exclusively to women is frequently condemned by the general populace ie men as being without taste merit or worth eg romance    my feelings about twilight could be mapped out as a series of complex dips and rises ive always been really into vampires and remember seeing this book on amazon back in   you know back in the days when it only sold books and cds  while looking for books about vampires to ask my mom to buy for me intrigued by the promise of dark romance i clicked to read the kindle sample and was a little surprised when the opening paragraph featured not vampires but some privileged bitch in an eyelet lace blouse whining about how she was exiling herself to one of the most beautiful places in the world as punishment    i remember thinking wow this is dumb nobody is going to read this    and that is why i am not a marketing executive    when the book became ridiculously popular i was curious because i was a teenager and if theres a demographic thats demonized more than women its probably teenagers eg teenagers are sheep etc my mom bought me the book from costco of all places and with no small amount of skepticism i settled in to read i actually stayed up until am that night to finish it and ended up getting only a couple of hours of sleep for the classes i was taking the next day it was good there wasnt a lot of action but in a way that was kind of comforting bella was one of the first heroines that i really identified with  she was quiet and studious and socially awkward she enjoyed reading and not just in that token way that makes her not like other girls she wrote an essay on the misogyny in shakespeare a topic that i myself explored in one of my college essays i also liked the fact that she seemed both jaded and naive something that i as a worldweary eighteenyearold strongly related to i burned through the second and third books also purchased at costco thanks mom and then noped out of the fourth book when i found out that there were things like baby soulmates sex scenes involving pilloweating and weird science that involved giving vampires venom in place of bodily fluids and for some reason a different number of chromosomes that just so happened to equal that of the pineapple lets all just take a moment to sit back and imagine a pineapple with fangs    my point here is that twilight was easy to read and featured a generic heroine who had a quiet personality that didnt make me feel like i wasnt enough after all she was ordinary and got a gq vampire boyfriend maybe that meant that being ordinary was okay many ya novels stress the quirkiness or the glory of their heroines but i liked the idea of a plain jane it was also my gateway novel to classic literature i made my mom buy me copies of all the books bella read or mentioned which was how i ended up reading a slew of classics like jane eyre wuthering heights pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility that year for fun i know right    then the movies came out and kristen stewart became the muchmocked star with her dead eyes and robert pattinson the questionable hero with his scoffing interviews and scruffy appearance i wasnt happy with the casting choices and did not see the movie but other people did many other people did suddenly the movie  and the merchandise  were everywhere and so were the fans my god honestly if anything put me off this book it was probably the fans especially the ones who tore forums apart with their vicious arguments over the battle that will go down in history long after everything else has crumbled to dust edward vs jacob i found myself growing embittered against the book that i had previously enjoyed and suddenly i could see all the problems with it that i had previously ignored the relationship is toxic bella lacks agency grand sweeping gestures of love are expressed in the form of mortal peril twilight also ushered in a whole new era of copycats as everyone tried to write twilight with angels fallen hush hush twilight with werewolves shiver and twilight with faeries wicked lovely or the iron king    i decided to read this ten years later for a halloweenthemed romance challenge and also to see how my perspective on the book changed with time it is hilarious to me that bella with her limited experiences at the ripe old age of seventeen sounds at many times like a weary mormon housewife speaking about her father the way one might express frustration about a husband creepy and about her mother as a child she claims ignorance to social practices and yet gives herself the advice that a mom might and lectures her friends about being rude or irresponsible also who says holy crow unironically who isnt either eighty years old or mormon exactly    edward is also significantly less attractive to me this time around i think maybe its because he smacks of the patriarchal with his constant talking down to her as one might a child and his sly winks about her being so young while seeming old if you know what i mean hurr hurr thats a little creepy all the claims about their relationship being unequal are valid he is so much older than her that he has so much knowledge and experience and resources that she can never really aspire to be on equal footing the relationship is skewed in his favor and he is by his own admission a master manipulator its also very creepy that he watches her sleep and knew without asking where she kept her house key im still not over that even as a teen i was kind of like um hey wait    i also never noticed that um edwards taste in fashion is kind of bad in fact he dresses kind of like a sleazy s actor i have receipts go through some of my status updates for the book and see what pics i paired with them all that hes missing is a ron jeremy mustache i guess this could also potentially tie into the whole yearold mom vibe if bella is actually modeled of stephenie meyer and shes using edward as a template for all of the heartthrob leading actors in movies that she watched growing up which probably were from the s or s and probably featured questionable fashion choices like ivory turtlenecks and beige colored leather jackets    i do think that twilight changed the young adult and romance genres for the better in that it showed people that things ladies like can not only enter mainstream pop culture but also become raging successes that empower women not just to seek out and enjoy their own entertainment but also to go out and create their own i could say a lot of things here about some of those paranormal ya copycats and how i feel about pp fanfiction that is repackaged as original fiction but this review is already getting pretty long so lets save that for another day part of the reason its so hated is because dudes had to confront the fact that a movie for women had entered their safe space there was no room in this world for them the narrative was not about them there arent any guns or lasers in twilight and the action doesnt happen until the last  pages unless you count vampire baseball or nearcar accidents its an entirely characterdriven romance between a female teenager and a vampire and about how their relationship develops over  books im counting that bree book as  and midnight sun as  since it was never released people love to demonize romance and i still get comments from individuals telling me how stupid they think the books i read are but honestly twilight like all romances was just about escapism and having fun shes not very well read and is convinced that twilight is the best book in existence so we made a deal she agreed to read my suggestion if i read hers and something weird happened i actually liked it  turns out she gave up on the gaiman novel whilst i read this in one sitting i dont consider myself a literary snob i like to read a bit of everything but ive always steered very clear of this one because it has a certain stigma attached to it everyone i know considers it trashy but sometimes trashy can be a very good thing  so im a little bit surprised and i must say the interaction taught me that we should always read the so called bad trashy books ourselves before we jump on the bandwagon in favour of its infamy  moral of the story keep an open mind always edward i want to kill you and eat you alive i watch you sleep every night and eavesdrop on every conversation you have bella omg baeeee stoppppp how romantic for years i didnt even think of ever reading this book thats how convinced i was of how this must be the worst novel anyone has ever written on this planet until four days ago i had marked it on goodreads on my to go a long way round it shelf and now that i have finally read it as a result of some weird mood i must have been in  i can confirm that it isnt quite as bad as a lot of people proclaim it to be sure a lot of things can be found in this book which are simply wrong it is full of plot holes and inconsistencies but it is addictive and keeps you hooked if you are in the mood for a fastpaced story to which it is easy to get attached i was so convinced i would read twilight only so that i could hate it and tear it apart in a onestar review that i didnt expect of how it would actually surprise me that it would be entertaining gripping that i would not have to force myself to reading it but rather had to force myself to put it down  there are a few flaws with that story  bella swan might have talked about a different topic but she definitely knew how to perfectly summarize the book stephenie meyer wrote about her yes that book which teens have cried about that book about sparkling vampires and teenieweenie romance stuff from a literary point of view this book is pretty bad it was easy to find moments in which you wanted to get into a serious conversation with stephenie meyer about whether she thinks that the way her characters behave is really okay i mean watching someone sleep without them knowing  nobody can tell me thats normal  nevertheless i will not spend any money on the cash cow meyer turned her series into yet i have to confess that twilight made me feel like a lot of the hate surrounding this novel is directed towards yearold fangirls screaming their mind to the heavens by the mere thought of edward cullen dont get me wrong from an objective point of view twilight still deserves quite a huge number of star ratings and i would have been one of those people who hated it if i had expected to love it and be completely enthralled by a fascinating plot and heartbreaking romance that was not the case obviously my first introduction to the series was back in eighth school class when in our german classes each of us had to choose a book of our liking to present to the rest of the students one girl chose to read from a passage of twilight a girl who fit perfectly into the definition of the term fangirl i never understood the hype and still cant see why exactly edward cullen is so wellbeloved would he have turned into such a famous character if robert pattinson hadnt portrayed him in the movie adaption which by the way made me appreciate the book even more because of the movies awfulness  to mention some more positive aspects about twilight it introduces teenagers to literature and while it would of course be more appreciable if teenagers were reading the great classics at least it is better than reading nothing at all with reading being regarded more and more as something oldfashioned and obsolete among teenagers this can never be seen as a bad thing before i discovered classics and literary fiction ya fantasy has always been some kind of comfort zone something you can identify with as a teenager the question is should teenagers even identify with characters like they are portrayed in twilight the shy and emotionally acting bella the superattractive and heyletswatchgirlswhiletheyaresleeping edward  its questionable if they are indeed characters to look up to its also questionable if stephenie meyer is a great writer i dont think so at some points her writing made me cringe but millions of fans will probably tend to disagree with me twilight is not for everyone and it has definitely divided its readers but i have personally read books which were far worse than this it might come as a surprise to some but i actually read all  twilight books plus that additional seminovel eclipse thingy  and while i am by no means a big fan of this book unlike with the host also by stephenie meyer i think this is a case of revisionist history a lot of people hated twilight when it came out and a lot of people still do but in retrospect compared to most of the ya books coming out today this was actually pretty well written it is no masterpiece but it stands on its own  and while it might not bring new things to the table at least it doesnt try to convey itself as something other than it is and for that i give it props well i must admit it except for bellas outrageous sense of fashion that makes her think the long khaki skirtblue blouselow ponytail combination is peak haute couture this was a wonderful ride down memory lane maybe it has all to do with the huge amount of nostalgic feelings linked to this series but i kinda missed this world and i didnt even know it i also didnt remember sms writing to be so lovely as i didnt remember bella and edward being so sarcastic and cute once you cross off the list the insane obsession they have for each other rosalie and emmett are still my favorites after chief swan that is       me to myself at am wouldnt it be super absurd if i ignored all my current readings and tbr and just reread twilight for the first time in  years myself to me at am super absurd absolutely lets do it  im going to be honest here this wasnt even half as bad as some of you made it out to be  let us backtrack to when i was  years old i absolutely loved twilight back then despite me knowing how cringe the movies were a lot of the time i loved them although i went through quite a lot of the popular ya books during the next couple of years i somehow never got around to twilight i completely forgot about them to be honest but ive decided  is the year im going to read the series  the first time i read twilight was in  i forgot so much about the book that i decided to reread it before continuing the series i genuinely enjoyed twilight much more the second time around i will admit i cringed a whole lot throughout this book but thats a story for another time it honestly annoys me that bella wasnt thisemotional in the movies i feel like movie bella is a whole different person i was surprised with how sassy she actually was she had her cloudy moments but not as much as in the movies that aside she had some less than smart moments and a whole lot of recklessness i rolled my eyes here and there but in some ways i liked her  edward was so very weird i found it kinda funny how his expressions and reactions always changed from one minute to the next he was constantly moody but if i were more than  years old i guess i would be too i did love the cullens though when reading the baseball scene i felt so much nostalgia the scene from the movie was playing in my head and i just remembered how much i really loved the dynamic between the cullens alice was always my favourite and im happy to say that nothing has changed i enjoyed reading about carlisles past something i completely forgot about and almost everyone elses too i think im most excited about learning more about them in the coming books  i didnt like the romance much it felt rushed and instalove like which im not really a fan of the book felt kinda slow at times but i didnt mind it all that much i actually enjoyed the writing there was just something about it that really kept me reading the last quarter of the book was probably the one with the most action and it might have been the part i enjoyed the most though some stupid mistakes were made it is what it is safe to say ill be continuing the series im actually pretty excited about that hopefully ill continue to enjoy them at least a little bit  im not embarrassed to say i reread this because i was falling into a reading slump i needed to keep reading but i also didnt want to focus too much on what i was reading so yes this did the trick  am i changing my rating from the first time i read it nope initially i thought i might because i was so wrapped up in nostalgia however as i continued reading i began to see all the flawsclichesweird phrases this book harbored and i think three out of five stars is appropriate it isnt a terrible novel it really isnt but it also isnt great  oh bella because of this reread i realized you never had any aspirationsgoals before you met edward therefore that makes me dislike you  and i hadnt minded you much the first time id read this about  years ago seriously though i didnt like thinking that shed set aside anythingeverything for love or worse that shed been waiting to find someone to fall in love with because thats thats all you need in life insert beetles song here i think thats crazy shes sort of following in her mothers footstepsthen again i think thats mentioned later on when shes getting married the whole youre getting married so young bella like your mother im not sure  of course im team edward remember when that was a thing i was in middle school now i have a year until i graduate university its funny how time flies so yeah i still dont like jacob but i like him much more he seems like a nice crushridden kid  really i still wonder why people hate this book so much i think the writingstory is fine maybe its just because it was so overhyped and people hated that either way it certainly isnt terrible  while i dont see myself rereading new moon anytime soon i might surprise myself and continue rereading this series though i serious doubt it unless i hit another slump sometime soon  overall this did the trick with my reading slump and i also finally got around to writing the review for this novel so thats two birds with one stone  i have to be honest and say that i almost stopped reading this book several times despite the hype i was convinced it was not for me but then around page  or so  i got hooked so if you are having the same problem hang in there if you can i think i will read the others but not right away really its not that bad i definitely recommend anyone who still hasnt read this book to read it not because its great which is clear by my rating but because its so fun light and easy to read the humour is just enough to balance out the boring bellaproblemsparts it might be good to get you out of a reading slump imo dont expect much going into this is all id say just read it for a light read and youll love it at least i did and i laughed a lot  obviously no in depth review on this coz im sure there are lots and im not saying anything new many love it many criticize it i just dont feel like i have to write something to defend this book or say why its not a  star good book its just good and sometimes thats enough my thoughts on twilight a to z teen magazine style  i thought about hitting the spoilers tags but theres nothing revealed below that you dont know if youve been paying even mild attention to the bellaedward phenomenon  awkward action the mad rush in the last third of the book to create some dramatic tension seems to come out of nowhere and isnt always very um thoughtful i guess however maybe in the world where vampires and human interact or not these slambang conflicts emerge i cant say  bella edward gets too much attention bellas a better character shes smart isolative insecure forthright reserved confusing well everything a teenage girl can be i imagine every woman can relate to bellas attempts to navigate a ahem challenging relationship i like bella shed be a good kid to have around the neighborhood  cullen family i suppose you cant develop every character equally and maybe you get more on each of them in the sequels but the cullens outside of edward were as cardboard as they come esp esme who seems interesting but hardly speaks and whats the deal with emmett and carlisle i want to know and what about that one who hates bella i cant even remember her name shes so unimportant to the story  doubt these two fall in love awfully quickly and the doubtfear about some pretty heady issues gets resolved in literally a couple days now one could argue thats how teenage love develops but i dont know i agree  edward you know what i find fasci
Lolita,ranked as one of the top  fiction of the th century im not quite sure how to put this in words hell im not sure what i intend to say so this is going to be ugly if you want to sit in on this exercise be my guest youve probably got more important things to do such as organizing your cassette tapes and lps before shoving them in a box destined for the attic believe me your time will be better spent especially when you take that stroll down memory lane and consider how killer it would be to rock out to depeche mode and aha all afternoon its possible youre one of those badasses with some dead kennedys on cassette more power to you feel free to tear off your shirt and bathe with a oz of big bear you might want to clean your bong while youre at it you never know how immersed youll get in the hazy recollections of your exploits during the new wave or burgeoning hardcore era and might prefer a soundtrack to complement your deranged thoughts  as for lolita maybe this tangential bullshit will help get my point across ive recently taken a keen interest in watching deadliest catch but as soon as the show concludes i wonder what have i walked away with after investing  minutes and  rum  cokes to the accompaniment of these aweinspiring images of man battling the elements to strike bepincered gold not much appears to be the answer its just a bunch of crabs crabs crabs and masterbaiting the simple ingredients of all my friendships and relationships sure its awesome to watch seafaring maniacs risk life and limb to haul in the nasty creatures that pay their bills but theres nothing else to it just dudes getting stoked over a huge haul of crabs or lamenting some element of the life theyve chosen then you get to thinking how these dudes wives manage without them at sea for  days at a time obviously they are in the crabcatching business as well and the real kick in the ass is that i dont even eat crab hell ive never even tried a dish that incorporates any crab when i consider the ridiculousness of it all it seems pretty disheartening this sort of pointless introspection is probably how des esseintes got his start so ill leave it at that before it becomes habitforming  i cant say that my opinion of lolita is much different its just humbert humbert endlessly rhapsodizing about nymphettes most substantially his nymphette lolita and thats it ive probably never read anything so onedimensional in my life im sure the upper echelons of literary critics found myriad reasons beyond my primitive sensibilities for including this in the top  works of th century fiction i just dont happen to see it one of these qualifiers might be this absurd statement on the back cover lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized european colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar america now when we consider the social climate at the time of publication with bookbanning and obscenity trials recently being all the rage and you know that in order to somehow foist upon the public a tale concerning a grown mans obsession and fornication with a  year old girl the defenders of this thinlyveiled smut have to somehow show that there is something above and beyond mere prurient interest hidden between the covers of the book so statements like the one above are thrown out there to mindfck all i dont even know what the hell that statement on the cover is supposed to mean but postwar america were powerful buzzwords at the time and truly what else could you possibly use as a thematic defense for this book seeing as the book has nothing to offer except the ridiculous tale of a weathered old pervert ogling young girls on the hopscotch courts finding one that epitomizes his unacceptable desires and eventually having his way with her before attempting to completely control her young body and mind during a trek that can only be considered kidnapping on the grandest scale lets not forget that when his precious nymphette is purloined by an unknown fiend he goes off to ambush the guy and shoot his ass this is not the behavior of the hypercivilized my own rather sloppy upbringing declares that anyone with a shred of civility offers his adversary a duel rather than attack him unawares humbert is a lowly coward of the worst disposition the hypercivilized dont go around bagging  pound kids sporting skinned knees from spills at the rollerrink real men fish for those awesome and voluptuous amazonians the women who proudly stand  or more and have generous curves that modern fabrics fruitlessly struggle to contain from spilling forth in all their fullydeveloped glory our man humbert has no such redeeming qualities hes a scoundrel of the lowest and basest rank lets not forget that he weeps and when i conjure a mental image of the elusive hypercivilized european weeping like a bitch and throwing a tantrum doesnt enter the picture  while the frauds who compiled the top  fiction list and i might diverge in our estimations of lolita i will agree with our man john updike when he states nabokov writes prose the only way it should be written that is ecstatically there is no denying that the book is phenomenally written but the repetition of nymphettethis and nymphettethat simply overwhelmed me i was left with an indelible image of nabokov sitting there alternately referencing his thesaurus and a collection of kiddie porn for inspiration while hammering this out id have enjoyed this book a thousand times more had it been about turtles or walnuts or my mothers first communion hell anything else nymphettes suck there is a reason i dont go trolling for trim at the nearest bus station who the hell wants to put up with the behavior of a pubescent trollop  there isnt a whole hell of a lot that i know but i do know this if my choices were either read lolita again or spend a day crabbing in the arctic id better be prepared to get some frostbite on my beanbag i dont have anything to say that hasnt already been said about lolita but i ultimately found this more tedious and tiring than shocking or beautiful as it is described by many   this book is absolutely not a love story of any kind just to get that out of the way and the fact that it is described as one makes me doubt that those people even read the book  however one thing that the author of lolita is praised for is their ability to write so well that it makes people sympathize with a pedophile and abuser personally i can see what people mean by that as lolita is written in a way that distracts the reader from what is actually going on with gorgeous writing beautifully written monologues about love and what i found to be rather random anecdotes told by the narrator too often for my taste i think that making something so ugly sound so beautiful at times takes true talent so i do think that the author succeeded in that area  however for me knowing the premise of the story i was disgusted by the narrator from the beginning and that did not allow the pretty writing to make me feel as if i was reading something other than what i was reading and therefore i did not appreciate the writing as much as i couldve if it was say not written about pedophilia but something else entirely  take the monologues and quotes about love for example that i did not appreciate in this book as much as i couldve if they had actually been written about love and not something so horridly disgusting ultimately i could not separate the gorgeous writing from what it was written about so it was rather lost on me flowery quotes about love that are supposed to make me feel something will not make me feel what i am supposed to feel from them when they are referring to something so entirely undeserved of that beauty and therefore the feelings that said flowery quote would normally evoke in me   regardless of how effective i personally found the distractions in lolita i frankly found it boring  i did not understand many of the references that the narrator made to things in his time and while i understand the intent of the author in including all of those references and details it was wholly lost on me  my other issue was the frequency of those details that i could not understand it seemed as if the narrator could write about those things forever   additionally i almost felt as if nothing happened throughout  for me at least it was easy to get the gist of lolita from the description and just knowing about it its premise and the general controversy surrounding it it feels like one of those books that can be known and understood without necessarily having to read it yourself and that it is possibly not worth reading it yourself   still i am glad that i read it if not for anything other than just to say that i have and to now be able to form my own opinions on it i will also likely reread it later in life to see if my perspectives will have changed   the last thing i want to mention and the only reason i am mentioning it now is because i forgot to mention it before is that i do think that the author greatly succeeded with writing an unreliable narrator i also think that the story we were told would have been extremely different if it was being told by dolores nope not for me the verbiage is great the story is unique i just couldnt deal with this book its a very cringe worthy read i did no like lolita  i am giving lolita a two  i am just now writing this even though i read it some time ago  this review is inspired by some of my gr friends whose fearlessness about giving low stars to books they do not like has inspired me to change my rating of lolita from three stars to two stars as that is what i really feel  i could not read the whole thing  i struggled  i get that this a classic and book snobs who read this will sign in indignation but i do not care  i just did not get it and still dont  id like to thank anti book snobs everywhere for giving me the courage to rate lolita two stars i will never forget you  wowis this what an oscar speech feels like  back to the booknothing like what i expected and a nasty unpleasant business yes it is loved i do not judge anyone for loving it you can love the book lolita you can shout its praises from all over you can make the hills alive with the sound of lolita praise but not i  if everyone has a classic they dislike or two or five then this is mine  yes the writing is unique but i still do not like the book  and now i must admit i gave it three stars in deference of its classic status  to all involved in a certain recent lolita conversation this is for you two stars  hey lolita loversit could be worsei could have given it one star  lolita is a classic but it just is not my classic now it is time for some food  how do you review a book like this  was it wellwritten thoughtful and even amusing at times yes was it awful horrifying and disgusting also yes  i read rust and stardust by t greenwood last year and it was so fantastic that i wanted to read the actual lolita the story doesnt surprise any of us but it was still hard to read and at the end of the day i just didnt enjoy it  stars for me popsugar challenge   a book everyones seems to have read but you  im not sure if i went into this with too high expectations or if this book is actual meh i went in expecting something explosive like my dark vanessa something deeply uncomfortable that makes you want to look away but you cant what i actually got felt like a soggy newspaper from the fifties  lets me explain  for the entire book you are in the head of humbert a unreliable narrator if there ever was one who is a pedophile and falls in love with  year old lolita we never really know lolita as lolita we only know her through the eyes of humbert but hes more interested to tell us about car journeys than anything else its felt like we spent  of this book driving in his car and it was a snooze  the author is totally playing to stereotypes here the pedophile that swans around in his purple silk bath robe and perfumes his hair humbert is always referring to himself as fat and sweaty i guess this is the time period before we admitted that monsters come in all shapes sizes and are generally the normal looking human that lives next door  and this is why it feels like a soggy fifties newspaper to me i imagine on release this made headline news but as the decades have passed this just feels very weather worn and a bit meh  i think my reaction to this book is because i went in expecting something much more than it was and not taking the publication date into account i didnt find anything on the page  horrifying things are eluded too in a past tense the reader protection level is high here  im glad ive read this its a classic piece of russian literature ground breaking in its own time period and referred too a lot in modern media  clearly i am a weird human who is upset that i wasnt horrified and uncomfortable enough reading something this old and so fawned over i was sure i would hate it the new yorker said the reciprocal flow of irony gives to both the characters and their surroundings the peculiar intensity of significance that attends the highest art to which i respond wtf and how the hell does irony flow reciprocally like the reader gives irony back do they know that books are a onedirectional media with no interactive features and parsing the objects of this sentenceafter the bs about irony theyre saying that really great art is really great well duh and it is apparent to me the new yorker is the inspirational source of the magnetic poetry game whereby complex words are pasted together to produce what sounds like english but in fact has no meaning which brings me back to lolita which also has no meaning but thousands of sparkling words for those of you who dont know its the story of an amoral narcissist pedophile who manages to seduce a  yearold girl it takes  pages to really get a feel for how loathsome the narrator is thats fine craftworkhes unredeemable unapologetic though he apologizes constantly as people disrespecting others are wont to do and obsessed with little girls if this were a  page short story it would be brilliant alas there are  more pages of exactly the same thingwhat he daydreams about lolita at the beach what he daydreams in a cafe what he daydreams in the car some other stuff happensan accidental death a wave of paranoia where he thinks someones out to get him and eventually a sloppy murder but none of that matters as we concentrate on day after day after day of the narrator musing about how irresistible little girls are and how delighted he is to have one of his own yuk not for the creepy subject matterits fictionbut yuk for the publisher who thought  pages of a pedophiles streamofconsciousness was a novel oh plot spoilerin the three year span of the narrative lolita becomes three years older does that count as a surprise ending im going to look up how to reciprocate irony at the new yorker   as i said im torn between a one and a fivestar rating so ill divide this review into two parts just to make things absolutely clear i still think lolita is one of these unrateable books not only due to its highly controversial subject matter but that plays a huge part of course so lets talk about all the reasons why this novel is a masterpiece the writing style is superb nabokov has absolutely no right to be this freaking talented seriously this isnt even his first language go away honey you make us dumbasses who dont know how to write shit in english look bad yeah yeah so the prose is definitely the real protagonist of this book and the way nabokov abuses it to manipulate his readers and trick them into rooting for a paedophile genius disturbing but genius though i wouldnt call it rooting for him but more on that later  lolita is one of these books you hate then love then hate then love all of this happens in less than a second every single sentence you never get a break youre always on the run just like humbert never gets a break from his obsession with dolores and its so freaking exasperating and tiring but the writing oh the writing its so incredibly beautiful and cunning and devious it literally brainwashes you i know this all sounds like a red flag but purely from a storytelling point of view its actually quite brilliant i felt my appreciation for nabokov as an author grow and my revulsion for the book increased by the chapter as well im pretty sure that ive never  not once in my life so far  read anything from another person remotely capable of what nabokov managed to accomplish in lolita so yes i am very torn this man has a bunch of serious jedi tricks up his sleeve and i deliberately begged him to show me more ugh      okay now that i have raved about the perfect prose lets move on to the stuff that wasnt as enjoyable granted lolita does not have much of a story in the traditional sense its basically on the road with the bonus of child molestation i know i know its not the point of this book that humbert tells you about his great adventurous road trip or whatever but i still felt like the plot weakened halfway through or maybe i just got exhausted at some point because this book is awfully draining it sucks the life out of you not gonna lie some of the themes  no paedophilia surprisingly did not make the list humbert is a character who does not see paedophilia so its seldom discussed of course the readers know exactly whats going on  were remarkably well done and interesting to read about this might sound surprising but the most disturbing part for me wasnt the paedophilia it was the identity theft humbert strips away lolitas true self or well we never even get to know the actual lolita both metaphorically and literally he steals her childhood her free will and turns her into a doll shes nothing but a sexual fantasy bruh the male gaze has never been more real  i believe that its overall a rather interesting yet highly distressing position the reader is put in and it makes you think about topics you probably dont want to think about at least not from the pov of a child molester i felt extremely ambiguous when reading lolita though i had way more issues with both movie adaptations  freaking disgusting voyeuristic sexualisation what is wrong with you hollywood still i was insanely fascinated and intrigued and i also felt sick most of the time but watcha gonna do this is selfexplanatory i know but i just wanna remind everyone to feel sorry for or even emphasise with a morally greyquestionable character does not mean that one has to condone their actions or cheer them on when they do those things  we all rationally know that what humbert does is wrong and despicable but that doesnt mean we cant see things from his perspective  especially when the novel is for one so wellwritten and just beautifully manipulative and for another told from humberts pov perhaps that is a personal preference for i highly enjoy morally grey characters and fiction that sort of pushes me to my limits and forces me to think about certain delicateproblematic issues in an unconventional way however id argue that precisely because its a piece of fiction  yes child molestation is a real enough issue and i dont think that any of us reading lolita and maybe pitying humbert would ever disregard how grave it is in actuality  we are allowed to see and to a certain degree understand things from the position of the perpetrator again i am pretty certain none of us support his actions but the world aint black and white folks  at first i actually tried resisting humberts charm as a narrator because i already went into this book feeling somewhat appalled but nabokovs incredible prose and his dive into humberts deeply messed up mind made it almost impossible not to feel for him eventually or at times even feel with him for example when lolita turns into a selfcentred brat once theyre on the road  i caught myself rolling my eyes multiple times which seems exactly like the reaction humbert wants us to have since that is his as well humbert is a highly unreliable narrator but we are aware of that from the beginning and we know we cant trust his word we also know that the lolita presented to us is a construct a perverted fantasy an idea not an actual girl nevertheless he still manages to win us over at some point and that is due to the brilliant prose of nabokov and the intense way in which humbert manipulates us  all things considered this does not change the fact that i straight up despised reading this my experience was the absolute worst and i wanted to throw this book in a dumpster on various occasions i guess thats the point this novel is supposed to drive you over the edge slam you in the face and bully you even harder when youre unable to deal with it if lolita were a person theyd be a complete and utter psychopath  a masterfully charming and convincing manipulator capable of anything since my reading experience usually triumphs over objective criticism ill rate this novel lower than it probably deserves yes as i mentioned earlier this book is not supposed to be enjoyed or whatever but still im giving this  stars as much as i adore the prose and am in awe of nabokovs talent i cant  for the life of me  give this more than  stars perhaps one day ill reread this and be more generous who knows once again once again i am reminded of why i so seldom write reviews of classic books  theres the prevailing feeling that everything you could ever wish to say about them has been said much more eloquently by someone else that any topic or theme or character you want to analyse has been analysed much more extensively and deeply by many more scholars and critics sometimes as in the iliad i find this wealth of research and opinion reassuring and helpful sometimes as in hamlet i find it excessive and pointless sometimes as in lolita i cant even really bring myself to delve into it because ive yet to sort out my own feelings about the piece at hand  but i am rambling possibly because im not sure what to actually write in this review possibly because im still conflicted about this book  see lolita is a great book but it is not a good one it is wellcrafted sublimely written but rarely enjoyable i loved it but i never liked it more than any other this book has taught me that liking a book isnt necessary to appreciate and understand it i cant isolate one thread of itwriting character development plot settingbecause theyre all tangled up in the disturbing and mesmerising mind of the infamous paedophile humbert humbert though some argue hes technically a hebephile which is probably more accurate but its connotation isnt sufficiently vile i cant say i liked the writing without admitting that i fell at least a little into the trap humbert set for the unsuspecting reader lure them into the story with wit and wordplay i cant say i was sometimes irritated by dolores without acknowledging that shes entirely portrayed in humberts own warped and deeply unreliable view and i cant call humbert interesting because that would be the most damning praise of them all many people who claim to have read this book but havent or who read it entirely incorrectlyand yes you can read a book entirely incorrectly dont fight me on this believe that even entertaining the faintest interest in humbert means either that you sympathise with him or have a morbid fascination with paedophilia and the destruction of a young girl  and its understandable really by praising any of these things im admitting that i was at the very least a teeny bit complicit in the narrators actions that i voluntarily read the book all the way through and entertained his whole sordid tale and that is a very wrong and dirty feeling  never mind that its fiction the fictional part may even make it worse because we cant hide behind the guise of being informed or carrying on the memory of a terrible crime no its fiction face it unless you were required to read this for a class you read it for pleasure you read it because you were looking to be interested or entertained or because you were morbidly or literarily curious it feels icky doesnt it dont worry i read it looking for the same things not knowing what i was stepping into and still searching for them long after humbert lost any semblance of moral or physical restraint  so what can i say about lolita i can say that im relatively convinced nabokov is a genius or a wizard of some sort as he can turn a phrase like no other and really has no business being so incredibly literate in his second language i can say that structure and framing is used here to great effect  i can also say that it started off fantastically but got progressively more grating and difficult to read towards the end when events felt disconnected and boring hence the  stars it got exasperating i can say that nabokovs or is it humberts selfindulgence became wearying after a while and the descriptive details that before seemed so clear and precise were muddied and stifling and i can say that reading this book is an exercise in masochism like continuing to sniff some awful rancid smell because you think you can just barely catch a whiff of roses cloying about the edges  and i will sayadmit confess divulgethat i think this book was good and that if i cant pick and choose which parts of it to accept i would rather take all of it than none at all and i would rather people shoot me nasty looks for saying that it was great than nod primly when i say falsely that its a heap of paedophilic garbage because even though lolita is uncomfortable it forces us to come to terms with the fact that even a disgusting cruel manipulative man can play on our emotions and love of wordplay to use our humanity and our empathy against us its jostling and troubling but i think that being troubled is better than being righteous and i think that we all ought to be jostled every now and again  and the rest is rust and stardust disappointingclassics   travelsandwanderers   only reason why i made it through this book    i dont really know what to say once again my rating is based on my enjoyment of the book i put it up to two stars because  prose the way a very ugly story was told beautifully hh loved lolita had she not been  and he hadnt kidnapped her oh and the forcing himself on her and yeah the list is long this would have been beautiful it says something that the nabokov can make the reader forget that we are traveling with a horribly disgusting individual i even enjoyed parts of the book it was an interesting study on the writing style but i honestly did not like the book and i want to send hh through the seven gates of hell life is short and i dont want to spend my precious time on books that i dont enjoy i have so many books to cover on my tbr hence i have decided to dnf this book i didnt like the writing style i found the writing flowery verbose complex and intelligent but at the same very uninteresting i enjoy mental gymnastics but this one wasnt for me  so we have a middle aged protagonist named humbert who feels attracted only to girls less than  years of age he avoids women he doesnt feel attracted to all underage girls but only to the promiscuous ones whom he refers to as nymphets humbert is obsessed with a  year old girl named dolores aka lolita lolita is no good as well like humbert she is only  but has already lost her virginity to someone else consensually i didnt even know what sex was till i was almost  and how children are born till i was  so it was a bit shocking to come across things like that in a book and how so young a person especially a girl and that too from th century can do things like that  beyond that i stopped reading the book not because of the dark theme but i found the book dull the writing was definitely beautiful but the story was oh so very boring you would think that a book about such a disturbing subject would at least be interesting but i struggled to get through it humbert humbert is disgusting  hes obsessed although he claims to be in love with his  year old stepdaughter delores he refers to her as lolita  his nymphette gag me the only parts i liked in the book were when lolitas mean streak showed and she hurt him with her adolescent cruelness he plays the victim incredibly well  so well that i almost felt sorry for him  the book gets two stars for the writing alone the story gets zero i first read this when i was fifteen and i found it disgusting and didnt finish it four years later i still dont get whats good about it but i do form a new understanding of lolita a girl not passively molested but aggressively seductive nonetheless no matter how molesting instead of molested she is she will always remain the sexual object consumed by humbert it will always remain sexual violation instead of lovemaking last time i read this book i was near lolitas age and i read it in his russian translation and it did not impress me at all the second half just dragged and bored but people seem to love this novel and its english prose perhaps his russian was weak should i reread it in english as an adult although nabokovs writing is harmonious and there is a tranquil tone that carries the reader through to the end i simply could not get past the creepiness and evocative obsession of the narrator not enjoying reading this so im not going to put myself through any more  im not denying the excellent writing but im done personally i think this book is overrated storywise but as part of literary history its something worth checking out if you have the time for it just to see what its all about its especially something to consider nowadays the year  with the way pedophilia and consent are two hot topics for debate i forced myself to finish this so that finally i could get my around the world in  books challenge  donein  oh well i swore i would get it done even if not within the year and i did    honestly this is not getting two stars because of the subject matter because i honestly have no major problems with sick and twisted its just that this book went on and on and on and it was so incredibly descriptive in a way i didnt care for that being said yes absolutely the opening sentencephrasepoem of this book was absolutely brilliant but generally humbert humbert just seems to want to hear himself talk at length or rather wants to write things with insane amounts of detail i think this would be an interesting one to discuss in an open minded book club though as there is a lot to dissect but did i enjoy it the answer to that would be a firm no i dont think theres anything i can contribute which hasnt already been said considering its been published and controversial for more than half a century  so for future me you did it you read the book it was challenging but you confirmed for yourself that this book is definitely not a romance it is a book of distractions tricky distractions fun distractions manipulative distractions wordy distractions etc super fast review so i finally read this controversial classic wasnt even entirely sure what to expect but it was in a list of classics i knew it was controversial and my local library had the audio edition available first of all i would like to say that it is not the pedo porn that some people try to claim it is yes it is written from the perspective of a character who is a pedophile but i saw it as more of a book that goes inside the mind of a twisted man not something trying to promote that shit i saw it as very clear that the main character is fucked up that being said while it is very twisted and disturbing it is an interesting story i also think the characters are very well written unfortunately what ruins the book for me is its so slow and filled with a bunch of pointless babbling filler and rambling for way longer than needed it kept losing my attention thanks to this i mean this guy went on for half a sentence at one point as a prelude for using the word it i mean for fucks sake so yeah cut the filler down and i would have given this  hell maybe even  stars but i couldnt recommend this to anyone thanks to that its not terrible but gosh it just drones on about shit way too much which is a shame for how interesting the plot could be  when i started reading lolita i had a general idea what it was about but kinda wanted to read the original work through fear  disgust i dived into this novel details a very young hh in a love story inspired by the legendary poem annabel lee  by edgar alan poe then losing his childhoods love and what a dreadful person he turned to be   it was many and many a year ago    in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know    by the name of annabel lee and this maiden she lived with no other thought    than to love and be loved b
The Metamorphosis,gregor samsa wakes up one morning to discover hes been transformed into a giant beetlelike creature can he and his family adjust to his new form  the metamorphosis is one of those books that a lot of people get dragooned into reading during high school and therefore are predisposed to loath i managed to escape this fate and im glad the metamorphosis is quite a strange little book  translated from german the metamorphosis is the story of how gregor samsas transformation tears his family apart i feel like there are hidden meanings that are just beyond my grasp i suspect its a commentary about how capitalism devours its workers when theyre unable to work or possibly about how the people who deviate from the norm are isolated however i mostly notice how samsas a big frickin beetle and his family pretends he doesnt exist  theres some absurdist humor at the beginning samsas first thoughts upon finding out hes a beetle is how hes going to miss work now im as dedicated to my job as most people but if i woke up to find myself a giant beetle i dont think id have to mull over the decision to take a personal day or two  aside from that the main thing that sticks out is what a bunch of bastards samsas family is hes been supporting all of them for years in his soulcrushing traveling salesman job and now theyre pissed that they have to carry the workload poor things its not like gregors sitting on the couch drinking beer while theyre working hes a giant damn beetle cut him some slack  all kidding aside the ending is pretty sad ill bet mr samsa felt like a prick later the metamorphosis gets four stars primarily for being so strange and also because its the ancestor of many weird or bizarro tales that came afterwords its definitely worth an hour or two of your time i once used my copy to kill a beetle thereby combining my two passions irony and slaughter  wields   it was no dream  gregor samsa awakes one day changed forever how unpredictable is life one moment leading to a new labyrinth of existence where forward is the only motion available our scars and choices following us in a tuneless parade with few interested spectators despite our lives being a personal struggle it is constantly judged criticized and appraised by all those whom we encounter oh the injuries we inflict upon one another we alienate and assume instead of communicate we fear differences and we yell when we should love strange how the ones we love tend to be the ones we hurt or hurt us the most kafkas classic story the metamorphosis is an alarming tale of alienation and hurt that seems fantastical on the outside to house a bitter pill of reality that has roots in us all what is most compelling about kafka is his ability to construct a tale from personal anxiety and injury that broadcasts as a universal message to all that read it honing in on the guilt loneliness and frustration in every heart gregors terrifying tale of transformation is a powerful rendition of guilt and the failure to succeed in a fathers eyes that utilizes religious imagery and fantastical occurences to drive the knife into the readers heart and soul  gregor lives a life of solemn servitude to his job and most importantly his family his job is a necessity to support a family whose debts accrued by the nowunemployed father are being repaid by the fruits of gregors labor while gregor has provided the family with a modest home which he shares with them the debt seems an unquenchable burden he can never fulfill in the original german the word schuld means both debt and guilt a critical texture to the text ironed away by translation that opens a gateway of understanding gregors father issues there is the guilt at being unable to satisfy the father to live up to the father and the senior samsa is a quick tempered man kafka struggled with a strained relationship with his own abusive father a struggle that he transformed into a literary theme permeating much of his artistic output much of kafkas life soaks into this work much like the constant slamming doors he often complained of in his own household with his family  despite his transformation what initially upsets gregor most is that he is missing work i felt this sting deep within myself being the head of a household and barely making ends meet despite long hours the burden of the working class is to be so dependant on a job as lifeblood creating a system of guilt and depraved necessity that pulls us from bed to work despite any affliction we must work we must provide we must survive to stumble is to die yet even staggering onward seems just a slow suicide climbing towards an unattainable surface from our pit of existence gregor feels this the reader feels this and kafkas magic has been unleashed to fail to work is yet another failure in the eyes of the obdurate father but also in a society that is built to enrich the upper classes on the blood and sweat of the working class and at their expense at its very core this story is a critique of capitalism and the absurdities of upholding such a system  the father and the father seem united in the character of the elder samsa kafka himself struggled with his jewish identity made plain in his diaries as vladimir nabokov points out in his exquisite lectures on the metamorphosis the number three is pivotal to the understanding of the story the story is divided into three parts there are three doors to gregors room his family consists of three people three servants appear in the course of the story three lodgers have three beards three samsas write three letters three of course representing the holy trinity there are many other important details surrounding three such as the clock tower striking three after gregor retreats into his room or gregor standing on his three hind legs since the fourth was damaged beyond repair the rejection and unfulfillment of the father is also gregors failure to be valuable in the eyes of the father god and perhaps this may be the cause of the unexplained and rather unquestioned for the most part transformation that has befallen the poor man the fatal blow pinning gregor to the ground like a crucified christ while this may be a slight stretch there are other christlike references such as the sudden pain in gregors side much like the spear in the side while on the cross is an edenic apple thrown from the father rotting and festering in him like our sins until we breath our last  all language is but a poor translation said kafka made evident in gregors failure to communicate in his new form communication is the cornerstone of understanding others and being stripped of his voice severs his link to his family and humanity that was the voice of an animal the office chief exclaims after gregor attempts to communicate with them through language with his loss of language his family slowly ceases to view him as gregor but as a dumb beast easing them into letting go of their notions that he is still gregor he is now an unproductive dumb hindrance to their lives and they begin to forget him and move on to a productive life of work and family without him it is like an invalid aging relative many continue to care for them out of respect for their memory but the person slowly becomes a chore or a burden and not a humanbeing in their minds another view of gregor in his new state is that of a person stricken by crushing depression or other mental or emotional ailments where those around them begin to view them by their illness and not their soul they forget the person that is still there the person they know and love and dwell on the chasm forged between them it is human nature it makes it easier to cope how many people walk away when times get tough even abandon the ones they love because it is easier to convince yourself they are not the person you loved than it is to fight for them or fight for what was once had kafkas genius is that he took a personal experience and related it as a universal parable with endless interpretations each unique and equally valid as they blossom within each respective reader  rereading this story was a rewarding experience and i very much connected with it gregor was a traveling businessman and i am a traveling delivery driver the musings on the plight and unique depression of long hours in strange faraway places hit home as well as the notion from everyone else that traveling in such a manner is some royal treat granted i greatly enjoy the work and the freedom of being essentially a professional vagrant yet there is a tinge of alienation being a person without an anchor always on the move always chasing a horizon the feelings of guilt of alienation the struggles with family everything range true plucking my heartstrings like a guitar to form a foreboding yet fantastic melody kafka is as relevant to the modern reader as he was in his own time with themes that illuminate us with their timeless insight into society and the individual the metamorphosis is a novella written by franz kafka which was first published in   one of kafkas bestknown works the metamorphosis tells the story of salesman gregor samsa who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect and subsequently struggling to adjust to this new condition  the novella has been widely discussed among literary critics with differing interpretations being offered  the hunter gracchus is a short story by franz kafka  the story presents a boat carrying the longdead hunter gracchus as it arrives at a port  the mayor of riva meets gracchus who gives him an account of his death while hunting and explains that he is destined to wander aimlessly and eternally over the seas  an additional fragment presents an extended dialogue between gracchus and an unnamed interviewer presumably the same mayor gregor samsa awakes from a bad dream into a mad nightmare as he struggles stuck in his own bed this weary young traveling salesman has overnight been miraculously transformed incredibly gregor is now a hideous bug a dung beetle  or even a cockroach does it really matter what  he has missed his train in more ways than one but samsa is a real trooper still thinks he can catch the locomotive and make that vile business trip eventually getting off the bed with great difficulty just a slight crash in truth opening the locked door somehow and moving around on the floor in his many new ugly little legs the parents and sister are greatly shocked at his new repulsive appearance and when the office manager arrives to see what happened  big mistake he spots samsa and is out the door without a word spoken twitching a little now the bug becomes a burden to his lazy ungrateful family after years of gregor supporting them all by himself a job he hated with a big passion they much embarrassed  hide him in his modest quiet room feeding the monstrous vermin leftover garbage from their table scraps a menu the bug implausibly prefersmonths pass and it becomes obvious something has to give the reader will decide is samsa a real dung beetle or is he mentally ill but to some the gist of the fable is how much does your family love you a brutal depiction of a family in tremendous turmoilexpediency triumphs surreal inexplicable and unusual kafka explores the futility of human existence or does he  gregor sansa is turned into a bug and through the process he realises just how insignificant he is how insignificant we all ultimately are in the greater scheme of things he was his familys backbone holding them up supporting them financially whist they took the easy path however when that backbone is removed the unit adapts it carries on and finds new means of survival the most important member of the family is swept aside forgotten about and life continues as it always must i guess he wasnt that important after all  there are so many designs that can be put onto this story so many interpretations and this is what kafka does so well he leaves you with absolutely nothing no answers or explanations only a simple case of this happened and it ended like this we as readers look for meaning within the narrative because that is how narrative traditionally works there has to be a point to it all right but perhaps that is the point there is no point perhaps by looking too hard we miss what kafka is trying to say or not say with his passive writing  there are certainly elements of alienation in here even in the recollections gregor has before he was turned into a bug as per the modernist mode he was isolated from his peers and the world at large powerlessness is also another theme that runs through the story gregors family and gregor cannot stop what is happening they just have to go on with it and hope to make it through to the other side a suggestion that no matter how hard we work in life how much love or success we appear to have we can be struck down at any moment forced into a situation we cannot control we perish such is life  it would be easy to talk about elements of kafkas own biography here and consider the works relevance to events that would eventually happen later in the century but i think that would be to put too much of a design on the book his personal feelings about life obviously helped to propel much of his writing he wrote many strange stories though metamorphosis is the most renowned of his work utterly compelling yet bewildering this isnt a story that will ever leave the reader its haunting and told with realistic mundanity  one morning as gregor samsa was waking up from anxious dreams he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous bug the reader is left to interpret much of the story and its purpose but being so open to interpretation and at times vague is what lost the appeal for me  however what was incredibly thought provoking and powerful was the sense of alienation hopelessness and the evident breakdown in communication the lack of understanding and callousness of the family is not lost on the reader either and highlights how peoples habitual prejudices can cloud good judgement and kindness  this book made me ponder how well society deals with those things they dont understand or accept in other people it feels that some might avoid or even reject what we dont understand and therefore could respond inappropriately when we observe behaviour that is different in this case the further gregors mind deteriorates the less understood and coherent he becomes and instead of receiving the muchloved support and empathy he craves the family instead cruelly banish him from their day to day lives and employ a carer to do the work for them whilst being openly critical and abusive  what is extremely poignant with this story is that it appears to be inspired by kafkas own experience because shortly after completing the metamorphosis kafka apparently wrote in his diary i am living with my family the dearest people and yet i am more estranged from them than from a stranger  how sad  described as one of the best short stories ever written metamorphosis has received widespread critical acclaim but my feelings are mixed at times it felt ambiguous and imprecise yet it carried such important and sobering themes that were well done how can that be so it may sound strange but like the idiom claims the whole is greater than the sum of the parts was the reverse for me because i enjoyed the individual themes reflections but not the whole story i was left questioning the point of this story because of the ending and matter in which gregors story ended  some loved some readers disliked i felt both because i loved most of this very unique book but was disappointed because i feel the ending could have been written differently and with stronger messages that is not because i need a happy ending but in this case the ending for me was disconnected from the rest of the story and failed to conclude on some of the allimportant messages highlighted through the book  tragicomic unique and compelling and high praise for the storytelling and the powerful themes but a book that was a little disappointing because of the unsatisfactory ending for this reader  in  this novel defied time and had not aged a bit the narration is slow oppressive repetitive and better to support the surreal dimension of gregors condition the immobility to which he has forced nails us to the ground everything occurs behind closed doors in his room and the feeling of suffocation is intense the major metamorphosis is not of gregor but of the samsa family in the face of the degraded state of their son and brother the alienation in which they live makes no one surprised at what happens to gregor the rejection reaction is primarily due to the changes in their own life in a simple and accessible language with a good touch of irony this story opens several doors of reflection on kafkaesque themes such as dependence work a ruthless world social relationships family and the meaning of life  taking bedbugs to a whole new level travelling salesman gregor samsa wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a giant beetle rather than waving his legs and antennae in the air screaming omigod omigod ive turned into a frigging cockroach he keeps his composure and goes about his daily business with a selfless determination his family by way of contrast are a selfish unpleasant bunch and merely see gregor as vermin it has oft been said that angsty kafka might well have been channelling his own reallife feelings of worthlessness ie him toiling as a writer when he could serve his family better by securing a proper job that being so this poignant story is ostensibly one of alienation and guilt  many readers focus on the storys inherent sadness but as is the case with kafkas the trial the author lessens his existential load with a generous dollop of dark humour his writing is a little laboured at times but this might have more to do with my reading of a translation rather than his original overall from its genius premise to its allegorical ending metamorphosis is an entertaining pityinducing thoughtprovoking read despite its dark exoskeleton this anthropodcast has a soft abdomen and is a whole lot of fun when i was a childi used to get myself hide for some time and animatedly hear whats everyone saying about my disappearancewe all are walled up by insecurities incarcerated by uncertainties captivated by absurdities and haunted by fears of losing the people we love so helplessly  kafka touches delicate strings of relations with such audacity and ingenuousness that metamorphosis becomes a voice on drum even after more than  years of its publication kafkas writings largely originated from the conflicted relationship he experienced with his family especially his father and the glimpse of that biographical connection is vividly portrayed in form of our main character gregor samsawho to his utter misfortune gets up one morning just to witness a horrendous insect of himself transformed overnight so what do we expect him to do now consider himself in mid of some nightmere and sleep again shriek vehemently by first transformedsight of himself think of suicide maybe nohe doesnt do such thingand here we come to know typical kafkaherogregor is little startled to see himself an enormous insect and littler worried to get back into human formthe first thought strikes his head is of being late today from job and catching train to reach officeand counting time as he keeps lying in bed for a good deal timeand this is the thinking that paves ground for marxist approach of the novella gregor is the representative of proletariat class trying so bad to catch up with bourgoais considering job travelling day in and travelling day out and bosses pain in assa little box is not enough to touch other approaches like symbolism structuralism and a semblance of feminism in story the most horrific factor though is of alienationgregor in his own home is confined to hide and is treated strictly like the one he looksan insect a bigger one gregor becomes noticeably less human and more accepting of his transformative state with each act gregor also becomes physically weaker as his family abandons its denial of his insectlike appearance and their hope for his full recovery to a normal human condition they gradually become indifferent to his fate and recognize their need to pursue their lives without him his father returns to work his mother learns to operate the house without the help of a maid even adding the burden of taking in boarders and his sister assumes the responsibilities of adulthood where once he was the center of their lives he now becomes an unnecessary burden and an embarrassment and this is when he abandons hope gregor dies of disappointment  out of  stars to the metamorphosis written in  by franz kafka i think most people are familiar with the premise of this book and rather than do a normal review i thought maybe id question how on earth kafka came up with this one it was such a great way to tell the story and teach a lesson a man wakes up as a giant beetle i secretly suspect he came across a huge cockroach in his apartment while in nyc one day and how do you deal with such a change your family is afraid they are embarrassed you can talk whats really going on here what is kafka trying to say about life were all insensitive liars fakes humorists nutty so many things to read into here its a run book too when youre a bug lifes quite different have you ever managed something like that before no so how did kafka come up with all the little things to make it real im glad he did as this book helps you enjoy reading when you may be forced to read some classics at a younger age that dont appeal to you as an more mature reader you find all the symbols and beauty in the messages with this one i believe i read it twice possibly some excerpts for a third instance each time it gets better i would love to see a really good film or tv adaption purely to witness the metaphorical views a director would incorporate on the big screen or the stage the words are amazing but its what you experience by reading it that makes it such a wonderful book a strange fable about a young traveling salesman who metamorphosizes overnight into a monstrous insect rendering him unable to work and useless to his family who scrambles to feed his relentless appetite and find another source of income to sustain the household the storys succinct cryptic and written in sardonic prose that doesnt feel dated a strong final act elevates the work and lends it lasting power reread   once again i just have deep feelings of sorrow for the main character and pity at the ignorance of the others some people whom are bullied not accepted or abused might feel like gregor does in this story the thing is that in this story it happens within the home a type of metamorphosis does happen in these types of homes in homes where you dont feel wanted accepted loved needed valued sometimes that is what i think of when i read or think about this story is that gregor was abused undermined and treated badly there were only tiny gleams of the light of compassion let in here and there no one deserves to feel like a stranger in their own home or that they are in the way a hindrance we all can really learn a lot from a seemingly odd and macrabre story about what appears to be on the surface about a guy who changes into something else something others treat as pest or vermin this short story contains more than meets the eye my copy of this dark classic is almost  pages long  of which are notes and various critical essays with all manner of interpretations  it tells the story of gregor who wakes up to a living nightmare having been transformed from the son big brother family provider into a large icky insect a dung beetle according to the cleaning woman the fifty pages explore many different themes the main ones being transformation and alienation  gregor has become a creature who understandably inspires disgust and fear in his family he spends much of his time locked in his room where they allow him to live solitarily sequestered they dont question why he has suddenly turned into a nasty vermin they dont try to help him they just weakly hope he will get better at some point and then give up on that woe to him if he dares emerge from his room its soon apparent that it isnt just gregor who transforms  his family undergo changes as well  franz kafka who died of tuberculosis may have written this feeling as though he was as repellant as a giant beetle to his family and just as alienated which makes this absurd tale incredibly sad what a shocking beginning gregor samsa is a devoted son working as a traveling salesman a stressful job he abhors in order to support his parents and seventeen year old sister but looks forward to the time when all their debts will be paid so he can finally make a change but not the kind he soon experiences  as gregor samsa awoke from unsettling dreams one morning he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin his many legs which were pathetically thin compared to the rest of his bulk flickered helplessly before his eyes  in this weird little story a whole family undergoes changes that bring about a variety of emotions for the reader it left me feeling simultaneously mad and sad  the metamorphosis is an unusual read and great classic that should not be missed for fans of scifi and although i did not particularly care for the ending found it unputdownable  interesting to note that within his household franz kafka grew up with feelings of inferiority guilt resentment and confinementmuch like gregor i really struggled with this review for a while but however unimpressed i was with the story at first it wouldnt leave me alone the more i thought about it the more it bugged me so i guess in the end it did leave an impression even if a rather frustrating one the more i looked back at the text the more i saw its yes brilliance  all through the story but especially in the beginning i found myself wanting to shout  and possibly throw something  at gregor to wake him up from his bizarre comalike state why does he accept his inexplicable fate the way he does why doesnt he ask more questions why isnt he more devastated confused nauseous why does he lack the ohsohuman natural curiosity we all possess i couldnt wrap my head around it until i understood thats exactly the point i thought this story was utter nonsense and yes it is and thats also exactly the point  gregor is under the impression that his family went completely broke after his father lost his business but later we find out that this is actually not true they have enough savings to get them through a few years modestly we also get the impression through gregors telling of the story that his parents are no longer able to work however this turns out to be false also now whether the family has a gross communication issue or gregor is ignoring reality in his eagerness to help his aging parents it is clear that he has been taking on way more than he should have  the most haunting aspect of this story is not the bug thing its the gregor thing even though he is given the opportunity to tell his own story he is clearly incapable to do so its not so much that we dont get to know gregor it is more that he doesnt know himself and by isolating himself from reality he slowly got excluded from his own family  i read somewhere that he was the creature of a functionalistic professional life and i wholeheartedly disagree with that its the opposite he very much wasnt thus it becoming the vessel to his ruin  i believe that societal pressures and selfimposed guilt killed gregor samsa but take it with a grain of salt im projecting taking care of ones elders is just another stage of ones life where i am coming from and where kafka came from whether gregor was simply too immature too weak or perhaps too neurotic he clearly lost himself and finally crumbled under pressure he was gone way before his metamorphosis as theories go when it comes to absurdist fiction this is as good as any  i am reminded of a fellow bookstagrammers message explaining the meaning of the stranger to me  a book that i failed to understand  and what he said about individual freedom although there is an added twist to it in this case in that all gregor wanted was to make his familys life easier for them and he was willing to sacrifice his own for this whether it was worth it or not no one can fault him for that  i am left with one lesson from this story and that is the importance of occasionally putting aside the materialistic pursuits of life and stopping to enjoy and experience our love for each other before its too late and it slips away from us but take it with a grain of salt i am projecting again well this sure was a weird and thoughtprovoking book  it is about a man who wakes up to find himself an insect and it follows the effect this has on his family and how he comes to terms with the change and adapts to it  i am assuming it is about feelings of alienation and being different  a short yet profound story  im looking forward to checking out the trial  i cannot make you understand i cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me i cannot even explain it to myself i had not read anything by kafka before reading one of his books now feels like a flashback to a high school literature class how many metamorphoses can you find in this novel blaine at least four mrs minnick gregor grete the family as a whole and then gregor again what is the symbolism of the fathers uniform blaine hmmm im not really sure mrs minnick  yet beneath the strangeness the whole story read to me as an allegory for how families can and do isolate members who suffer from depression or a severe or sudden illness the metamorphosis is an interesting story despite being deliberately absurd a fast recommended read if youre curious about kafka was he an animal that music could move him so  metamorphosis the famous tale of a man randomly turning into a bug is many things the metaphor genius and subtle is neatly woven into a simple and almost ridiculous story and leaves it open to interpretation anyone can decipher the allegory in their own way and take from it what they will a single person can read it in drastically different ways depending on personal circumstances   what i personally saw in it was a critique of discrimination a lament for the marginalized the oppressed the outcasts of society and minorities anyone whos alienated from the norm in some way can feel gregors situation personally of course i relate to it too few people never experience any form of alienation in their whole life   metaphors and philosophy aside i found metamorphosis humorous more than anything i actually chuckled out loud at the descriptions of the bugs twitching legs and the whole situation i know if id read this in a different state of mind i could have triggered my own depression and enter an existential crisis episode over it typical but i read it listened to it while sorting out my old entomology lecture notes and illustrations ironically so i found it filled with humor even though in a very dark way i dont know if kafka intended for this to have dark humor all over but i found it and caught it anyway i sometimes find humor in the darkest of situations as a defensive mechanism to not let myself give way to despair its an effective method   also its always fun when you give an allegorical tale of a man turning into an insect to a zoology student with a particular interest in entomology who will definitely take it literally to some extent many questions arise how big exactly is this insect is it anatomically a normal insect simply engorged or is it more like a prehistoric arthropod from the carboniferous period what is the exact scientific classification of this mysterious bug so many questions i guess ill never know   jokes aside i am curious to know how ill interpret metamorphosis in a decade in my thirties or at any time when im not so comfortably relaxed and ready to see comedy even in places it doesnt exist ill have to wait and read it again and see   after all we can all be gregors at some point or other in life relating to him in our own unique ways i cannot make you understand i cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me i cannot even explain it to myself a dark story of a person losing his humanity and family   stars  there is an abyss that awaits if you are no longer of use to the ones around you is what franz kafka seems to say in the metamorphosis  how gregor samsas parents and sister respond to him when his appearance and way of ex
The Time Traveler's Wife,the time travellers wife was published in  it was audrey niffeneggers first novel and is a surprisingly accomplished feat involving a complicated time structure and alternating firstperson perspectives the two main characters henry and clare are introduced by way of a prologue the couple meet in a library in chicago but while clare clearly knows henry very well and has done for a long time henry does not seem to know who she is he is vaguely dazzled by this luminous creature who insists that she has known him since she was six years old  at which time he was   since clare is now  and henry is  this seems a confusing scenario for the reader we gradually come to understand that this is because henry has been travelling from his future to her past and that in her past they had fallen in love we understand that henry hasnt actually yet met clare in his own present henry therefore is the time traveller and clare is his eponymous wife this sets a pattern for the rest of the story which largely follows clares life but is interspersed with some of henrys timetravelling adventures audrey niffenegger explains that henry has been born with a genetic dysfunction which she terms chronodisplacement  the time travellers wife is divided into three parts the first book the man out of time broadly covers clares growing understanding of the unique relationship she is to have with henry clare has carefully kept a diary which details all the future dates for henrys visits and she shows him this on almost their first meeting the obvious result is that henry feels rather overwhelmed and confused and does not know what to make of it all but also finds himself very attracted to clare her obvious passion and fervent loyalty it also squares with his own experience and what he knows about himself  henry can remember the first time he time travelled on his fifth birthday he had enjoyed his first visit to a museum of natural history in chicago so much that later on he found that he had suddenly been pulled back there in time to the museum the novel breaks the accepted rules of most time travel books at this point by having young henry meet an older yearold version of himself the older henry explains that he is a time traveller but that it is a great secret all through henrys teenage years the older henry teaches him various tricks which he will need to know to survive such as stealing breaking and entering and running from the police  a major shift in the narrative comes as we next read a description of the event clare has already referred to we jump to the first time she as a yearold met the yearold henry in a meadow near her familys house on lake michigan henry had called out to clare from behind a bush where he was trying to conceal his naked self oddly this apparently rather dubious situation comes across in the story as being rather sweet with a very selfpossessed young clare merely handing henry her picnic blanket so he can cover himself up  the book follows her childhood and teenage years her longing for a physical relationship with the yearold henry since she knows that she will be with him in her future we see her growing recognition that her peers think her strange wondering why she is not interested in boys of her own age  a particularly poignant part of this first section is set at christmas time clare has hidden henry in the reading room of her parents house she knows that henry hates christmas because he had told her that was when his mother died on the morning of christmas eve when henry was six years old both he and his mother had been involved in a car accident on their way to pick up his father henry managed to survive only because he had time travelled ever since that occasion he had been overcome with guilt for not being able to save his mothers life travelling to the scene of her death over and over again but helpless to do anything except watch the tragedy unfold henry thinks he should have died then too  however the book has many comedic moments since henry can never take anything with him into the next world not even his clothes usually he can name the date of his next trip and clare becomes used to arriving with clothes for him but as the novel progresses there are more of the spontaneous shifts where at any moment henry finds himself sucked out of the present and thrown naked into another time and place  one example is when clare and henry get married with all their family and friends in attendance henry is whisked away without warning just before the ceremony but through a coincidence beloved of novelists an older henry shoots through the years to take his place oddly only the most observant of guests wonders about his suddenly grizzled appearance  the second book a drop of blood in a bowl of milk begins with henry and clares married life which is marked by henrys frequent absences and clares inevitable worries about him she has begun to feel trapped and frustrated in their small apartment of course with the premise of the novel henry is able to buy a winning lottery ticket which he duly does they move into a larger place where clare has a studio and can pursue her art ventures and all is hunky dory again  audrey niffenegger carefully explores the emotions of the couple and it is interesting to the reader to observe the dynamics of their characters and relationship the time travel element serves to highlight and sometimes resolve any cracks in the relationship there is a point in the novel for instance where clare is in her thirties and henry is  their relationship is rather jaded as clare narrates  henrys been gone for almost  hours now and as usual im torn between thinking obsessively about when and where he might be and being pissed at him for not being here i hear henry whistling as he comes up the path through the garden into the studio he stomps the snow off his boots and shrugs off his coat hes looking marvellous really happy my heart is racing and i take a wild guess may   yes oh yes henry scoops me up and swings me around now im laughing were both laughing  the reason for this as their present selves both know is that henry has been swept back to the date when he and clare first made love when clare was just  before once again being pulled back into his present and the recognition of this mends the breach they are both feeling and also serves to demonstrate to the reader a shift or dichotomy within any relationship new or established where one is feeling and experiencing different emotions from the other at any one time  this dichotomy then is the crux of the novel one persons story is always going to be slightly different from anothers even when they are experiencing the same relationship  the novel does have limitations its focus is really very narrow even though the complexity of the time travel element does mean that the reader tends to give up on carefully following the chronology  the dates heading each chapter  and just go with the flow but these two characters seem to be almost fanatically trying to have the conventional american dream of happy normal domesticity and in the end this begins to pall a little to feel a little tired  there is even an attempt in this middle section to give the fantasy element more validity with the introduction of a new character a dr kendrick with his assistance henrys involuntary time travel will later become known as chronoimpairment sadly this plot development leads nowhere the doctor says he wont be able to cure him because this newly recognised disorder is too complex to work out and treat during henrys lifetime the condition does appear to be hereditary which explains clares repeated miscarriages the unborn babies seem to time travel which means that clares body aborts them there is a way around this however again using the premise of time travel and eventually henry meets the child alba whom they will have together in the future he discovers that she has more control over her travels than he does but also learns from her the imminent date of his death  there is also a mysterious shooting accident in this part plus a gruesome operation making henrys ability to time travel very dangerous neither of these episodes i found terribly convincing the accident seemed to be put in purely for the mystery element  to make the reader wonder at the reason for all the blood to wonder if it was fatal  during a couple of time travel episodes the unconnected medical operation merely seemed rather ludicrous  the third book a treatise on longing is possibly the least satisfactory part of the novel it describes clares life after henrys death although a letter from henry has urged clare to move on with her life she also learns from it that he had once travelled to her future where he had seen her as an old woman this makes clare decide to wait for him for many years alba sees henry on his visits but he never visits clare again until she is  years old  although with this final section the ending is inevitable and meant to be poignant it comes across as rather sentimental and maudlin throughout the novel the reader knows that henry and clares lives are already mapped out and the time of their deaths already written this impinges on the fantasy element rather too much in fact it smacks a little of a spiritual religiosity  and one without free will however this is a very ambitious project for a first novel and for much of the novel it translates onto the page with skill an authentic believability and a fair amount of charm if there had been no time travel element this would be a romantic novel perhaps with a psychological focus or a simple family saga the domestic details here are more enjoyable because they add the necessary realism to the fantasy even though the relationship element is predominant the fascination with the time travel element tends to enhance what might otherwise be a mundane if romantic story some of it works some does not some is rather mawkish  it is very possible that audrey niffeneggers best novel is yet to come she has since written another novel her fearful symmetry and a balletic fable for the royal opera house ballet in london in addition to her previous graphic novels she is professor of creative writing at columbia college chicago it will be interesting to read the novel she is currently working on the chinchilla girl in exile and to see whether this novelist has grown in stature  i wont ever leave you even though youre always leaving me  i wanted someone to love who would stay stay and be there always  maybe im dreaming you maybe youre dreaming me maybe we only exist in each others dreams and every morning when we wake up we forget all about each other obviously she knows me and i dont know herthe girl sort of breathes henry in this very evocative way that convinces me that at some point in time we have a really amazing thing together this makes it worse that i dont know anything about her not even her name  bbc radio   bookclub audrey niffenegger  the time travelers wife  there was plenty to like in audrey niffeneggers the time travelers wife beginning with the concept of henry slipping in and out of time to meet his wife or wife to be clare at seemingly random points in her life the behaviors hes learned because of his involuntary time traveling add a certain poignancy to them even having a sustainable relationship that and the details of henry interactions with clares family gives their unlikely relationship a certain realism while it did remind me of doctor whos relationship with river song because this time traveling wasnt done in correct order there was appeal in how it unfolded i thought the writing was good too for all that however the overall effect came at me like a hallmark movie if you like hallmark movies that may be a good thing it just didnt close the deal for me  stars  i am in a fix trying to figure out what rating to give this book i liked the premise of the story but i failed to become emotionally invested in the charactersno matter how hard i tried i just could not bring myself to like henry or clare for all their problems they just seemed a bit selfish and self centred at  i didnt think i would make through with the encouragement from others i completed the book this book takes some patience it can be confusing dont try to keep track the book skips around so much in places really makes no sense i did end up enjoying it i listened by audio i really enjoyed the narrators if i didnt i would have given up on the book the end kind of sucks this was one of those books that im not overly sure about as i found it to be an interesting read but i also found it a bit confusing in parts time travel books are enjoyed by many people but im afraid i just cant quite wrap my head around them  having had a quick glance at some of the reviews for this book it seems that some people really enjoyed it and some were a bit like me so for those who do like reading these kinds of books i suggest you read this book as i have no doubt you will enjoy it  henry is a time traveler mostly into the past to visit his future wife clare at various ages their ages vary widely starting when she is age six he has no control over where and when he travels and arrives nude and disoriented he occasionally encounters himself  the story is told from two perspectives alternating between henry and clare the focus is on their relationship though much of their interaction is of a sexual nature and they rarely engage in meaningful or deep conversations for example they only scratch the surface of significant issues related to their unusual lifestyle  free will versus fate  ethical boundaries with regard to henry as an adult influencing clare as a child  stress and pressures involved in keeping many secrets from a loved one  in the part related to science fiction the author does a good job of dreaming up a plausible reason for henrys timetraveling condition but the overall storyline is more of an entertaining romance in which time travel results in heartbreaking consequences it goes on for a few chapters too many and the foreshadowing takes away from the dramatic ending i enjoy a good time travel book every now and then and i liked this one but it could have been so much more just in time for the movie release i finally got around to reading this after itd been sitting on my bookshelf for months theres a lot of hype surrounding this book which automatically makes me want to hate it in a very superior way but i cant hate it because frankly i liked reading this not loved just liked the simplest thing i can say about this story is that its nice but just for fun im going to do this review in a style i call the good the bad and the ugly because then i get to complain and nitpick more  the good niffenegger say that five times fast gets maximum points for originality plus ten bonus points for writing a book centered on time travel that never makes the readers go crosseyed from confusion yes the time travel aspect takes a little getting used to but it didnt leave me nearly as mystified as plot devices like that usually do and while i wish she hadnt felt the need to come up with a scientific explanation as to why henry time travels genes really i understand why she wanted to make the story as plausible and realistic as possible  the bad the book is a romantic story first and foremost and you have to be in the right mood for that since i possess a level of cynicism and disillusionment usually reserved for ninetyyearold war veterans schmoopy romances like this are rarely my cup of tea but for the most part it was okay the next thing is a minor nitpick but its still bugging me at one point in the story henry describes his former girlfriend as looking like her usual bond girl self i wonder how many bond movies has this author actually seen id guess the answer is not many but maybe ive just seen too many is it just me or does describing someone as looking like a bond girl seem way too unspecific i mean think about all the different bond girls  they dont all fit into one specific mold pussy galore vs vesper lynd for instance  the ugly to be perfectly frank i got a little tired of constantly hearing about how mindblowingly fantastic henry and clares sex life was it seemed like every five pages they were fucking again and niffenegger almost never says having sex or making love it is always fucking classy really niffenegger we dont need to know all of this stuff you say clare goes crazy for oral sex how fascinating can we move on now oh good now clare is fucking someone else i hope we get a blowbyblow description and then a tasteful far overdue fadetoblack the author gets credit for keeping henry and clares early relationship relatively notcreepy this was when he was in his forties and time traveling to clares childhood but that goes out the window when clare turns eighteen and henry visits her as a yearold this incendentally is the point at which clare discovers just how much she loves having cunnilingus performed on her  excuse me while i go stand in the corner doing the cootie dance ive wanted to read this book for years and i finally got around to it this book has a shit ton of hype and is considering the greatest romance of all time when in reality this story is just okay i think the concept is interesting for sure it follows henry a time traveler who meets his wife clare when she is a young girl it follows them over decades as he tries to figure out why this happens to him and it sucks because he has no control over it so he can just disappear out of clares life at any moment in time  clare and henry are okay characters but i never really connected with either of them clare has no life outside of henry and all she ever thinks about and talks about is henry so it got kind of irritating at times henry on the other hand has a pretty interesting back story and i found his character slightly more interesting than clare but not by much  can we also talk about how creepy this concept is i mean a full grown man appears completely nude in the meadow behind clares house when she is only a little girl and its love at first sight i guess he asks her to bring him some of her dads clothes and he doesnt flirt with her or do anything weird but its still weird imagine if clares parents found out about him when she was a little girl they would freak the fuck out im sure of it  overall this concept is interesting and this story is okay but its nothing sensational and certainly not something im going to remember in a few months also this book was way too long for what it was it was over  pages and it couldve easily been cut down by  pages or more there were so many filler pointless scenes especially the scenes of their dreams i was expecting more from one of the apparent greatest love stories of all time but i guess thats setting the bar kind of high ok to be honest im having a hard time reviewing this book i had a mixed feeling that sometimes i like this book and sometimes i dislike this book there were moments when i just want to throw this book and moments when i suddenly realized that im having a hard time putting it down its difficult to write the review cause somehow i want to tell you everything  henry has chronodisplacement disorder and he will be sucked backs and forth in time mostly when he was stressed he cant control it didnt ask for it and is not exactly happy with it but he learns how to handle it he shows up naked and has to figure out how to survive for however long he is there sounds scifi to you i have never been a fan of scifi but i can tell this is not pure scifi in my opinion the time travel is just an element background for the story perhaps some people might be more carried away by the romance and relationship between henry and clare  the story unfurls through time with first person perspectives from both henry and clare the first  pages really engaging and intrigued me i remember that i found it a little difficult at first i mean i couldnt keep track of anything cause the time line shifting back and forth rapidly but on the contrary that was the main point that hooked me i eagerly awaited the moment where it would become obvious that clare and henry were meant to be together the battle between free will vs fate plays an important role in the story thats was the biggest issue for me that keep me wondering all the time even after i finished the book but then things turned for me at some point midway through the book i dont why but i felt the book suddenly turns out to be so tedious for me that i decided to put it off for a week too much unnecessary details for me i guess d but then theres something itching in my mind that somehow triggered my curiosity to find out what will happen to henry so i decided to finished it  ok spoilers alert  do not read beyond this point if you havent read the book or you have plan to read this book    after finished this book i have so many question dangling in my head do i like it do i hate it should i gave two stars or four stars instead of two stars i mean this book sometimes funny shocking boring heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time i dont know whether im confuse or just stupid the good the nonlinear narrative was interesting the idea about love story blended with the time travel adventure are great it make me wondering this question what if constantly i know that certain scene made some people sobbing and bathed in tears well i admit that i had my moment too d not the ending part though but the moment when henry and claire meet the seven years old alba i loved her from the future how alba ran toward henry and crying in his shoulder and henry whispered in her ear not to tell clare that he will be dead soon henry died when alba was five years old so i understand how happy alba and henry to see each other its heartbreaking i feel like an ugly giant sap at that scene ok there i said it enough about that d the bad i dont know how i felt about clare character it seemed to me that she is never given a real chance to have her own life some of her decisions were made because she knew about the future for example would clare learn to like coffee if henry didnt tell her that she already like it in the future and i think henry and clare relationship is pretty much built on sex did i mention that theres so much sex in this book i remember i uttered the f words out loud in the middle of the night when i stumble upon the scene in which clare had sex with henry while the present henry is a asleep next to her i dont know but for me thats just freaking annoying i also found the relationship between the young clare and the older henry disturbing for me it was kinda child molestation by an adult male it seemed wrong even though nothing wrong happened between them at least until clare turns eighteen years old i said whoaaaa at clares  birthdayd the time travelers wife is a love story and a rehearsal of sciencefiction as it plays with the timetravel theme the plot skips back and forth between the pointofview of henry the timetraveler himself and clare his wife however i felt there was little difference in their voices nevertheless as henry goes skipping through time against his will we hear both points of view  one of the main issues that troubled me in audrey niffeneggers story is that neither protagonist has much choice in their destinies he suffers from a condition that makes him disappear from one time and appear on another randomly if henry seems to have no control of his life clares life has been entirely determined by henry since he met her when she was only  years old henry seems to have in a sense seduced her for from them on her life becomes tethered to his  nevertheless leaving aside the ambiguity of their relationship there are interesting scenery changes with the timetravel shifts and an enduring and elusive love story with its own aches and longings a well told and enjoyable book henry and clare are entangled in each others past future and present henry has a rare gift he can time travel but his destination is always unknown to him he never knows when or where it will happen and so ends up spending his life in moments that seemed to be fragments in time can their love overcome this strenuous obstacle this book is so sad i mean it has moments of happiness and that is great but i would put it along the lines of p s i love you and almost dangerously teeter tottering towards girl on the train meaning its that kind of depressing i mean nothing these characters do to try to make their lives work together seems to go through for them it all seems to shatter to pieces every time they try it is just such a tragic love story i have to wonder who i feel the most pity for in this story do i feel more pity for henry who is cursed with this gift to jump through time at unknown junctures where anything can happen to him or do i feel more pity for clare who is seemingly doomed by henry himself for him getting involved in her life before they actually meet in my opinion poor clare was doomed from the very moment henry showed up in the meadow she was his from that time on and would never have any other i guess henrys gift became a curse on both of them but i digress lets get to the writing shall we i very much like the unique idea of time travel in this book it hasnt truly been done in this manner before and for that i really do commend the author as it is a subject that is widely written about i personally found the writing to be slow and boring especially in the beginning and made for a very difficult read to jump into no pun intended but eventually the story does pick up and the book does get better i guess you just have to push through the beginning because of the nature of henrys gift and the way the author chose to write about it there is a lot of repetitiveness in this book and i will forgive the author for that because she did such a great job keeping things straight with dates and times and ages of the characters so that way the reader can read both henry and clares stories in a comprehensive way everything in the book is very well put together so that we are reading a story instead of just fragments in the timeline it is very difficult to write a good book about time travel considering the fact that we know next to nothing about it and can only theorize and conjecture what it would be like imagination is key here and this book definitely has enough of that to make it a good read i would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good fantasy romance or is interested in time travel in general at the very least this is an incredibly unique book it is definitely a sporadic look at time travel and attributes it to a genetic change making henry a mutant  the good henry and clares dual narration makes for a better allaround telling of a chaotic story the uniqueness in the approach of time travel the rich cast of characters  the bad i dont think that audrey niffenegger understands a lot about the thoughts of men this book was blatantly written by a woman in henrys thought process and i wish this could have been corrected in editing because it would have made the story stronger for example henry can barely say i love you to another man yet he can service himself sexually the inconsistencies such as this take away the constant time jumping doesnt always add up if you take all of the events out along a linear time and put them together which was somewhat frustrating this showed another editing issue with possible added or subtracted events i think a lot was missed in the time travels of a later character that could have been used to bolster a story instead of as an afterthought this character was incredibly lacking in development which didnt make a lot of sense given the implications  overall i applaud the unique take on the subject and it is still worth the read at least once in ones life i watched the movie once long ago and even without reading the book i found it to be subpar so this is definitely better than the movie ultimately i mostly felt bad for both henry and clare that spent the book mostly exhausted and miserable and didnt seem to actually have much happiness overall even though it seemed to try to tell me that as a reader i didnt feel like it really ever showed me much happiness in writing  greta quote im sorry i didnt know you were coming or id have cleaned up a little more my life i mean not just the apartment  overall it sits at a  for me the time travellers wife is probably one the rare few books that i read after having already seen the movie but it was on the list and you dont argue with the list my friend and i last year decided to take the challenge to complete the bbc  list this is number twenty five  on the surface it is the same old boy meets girl girl meets boy they fall in love and then something bad happens la de dah  but heres the thing the boy has a rare genetic affliction that allows him to time travel without any nifty little time machine hidden in a compact guitar case or a delorean and it doesnt really allow him so much as make  him jump in time and therein lies the problem he cannot control where in time or place he ends up in also he cannot take anything with him when he jumps so no money no clothes and bye bye identification poor bugger  audrey writes in style the slow quiet prose was a good addendum to the lull left behind by the holiday season slowly receeding like a fog in my brain perhaps it was that or the guilt of not having read much over the course of the month that got me through the book or perhaps it were these little paragraphs strewn thoroughout the book   there are a few faint lines at the corners of her eyes and mouth that are the merest suggestion of the beginnings of clare s face in middle age i will never see that face of hers and i regret it bitterly the face with which clare will go on without me which will never be kissed by me which will belong to a world that i wont know except as a memory of clare s relegated finally to a definite past  about the latter is it because audrey belongs to the gender that she writes so poignantly yet beautifully on the ravages of time with my head swarming with labels and sparkling people who are supposed to set the bar on beauty in these times  not to mention one very irritating duo that my facebook newsfeed informs me every day has broken the internet with their awesomeness this capacity to axle on the metamorphosis of beauty is refreshing  the above for me was the high point of the book and its all downhill from there the story itself is very one dimensional focused on taking the characters from one point to another without much to speak for the development of the story being primarily a love story the book plays on the concept on inevitability such that girl falls in love with a boy who happens to appear out of nowhere to her on a meadow i can understand the curiosity but not the premise that it served as the linchpin of their supposedly epic love story am i to believe that she fell in love with boy because he appeared to her sounds kind of desperate and audrey doesnt really provide me much of a counter argument even when girl and boy meets in real time all girl wants is for boy to quickly become the man she knows from her childhood  another flaw that stuck in my mind is the accident that kills boys mother that affects him so deeply that he travels in time countless times and ends up observing the accident from all angles revolving around the epicentre of the site of accident but that is it theres no road leading to or from this point and it just acts as one tidbit of information on boys background that is thrown our way there are galores of such subplots in the story that lead nowhere and in a book that is  pages long is really really well weak writing   audrey herself admitted in an interview of the many loop holes in her concept of time travel there is no butterfly effect since boy does not really travel to a different time stream and all the bugs he steps on are preordained so when the old boy meets his younger self there isnt any consequence since his timeline itself is askew thus old boy teaching young boy tricks of survival leads to a very chicken and egg situation that makes my head hurt when i try to understand the intricacies of it  according to quantum mechanics time travel beyond a boundary layer of time with the invention of the machine itself as the centre starts breaking the fabric of time so as far as boy is concerned he adheres to this rule but his daughter is capable of bending in some cases utterly shattering this rule i get that an author has the fr
Siddhartha,on the surface this is a harmless fable of a man struggling through life and coming to peace with the universe lovely gentle comfort food spiced up with mysticism its a bedtime read  the problem is its supposed to be a book that explains the origins and teachings of buddhism and as keely points out in his review when a foreigner tries to write a story about a country and religion he knows very little about he will always get it wrong  everything is so so posed so exotified we are invited to gawk at the characters and how different their lives are as if they were colorful birds in a zoo the narrative is obsessed with strange sights such as mango groves fig gardens clay huts animal sacrifices and meditation as if siddhartha were a stranger in his own country its like an american driving around his normal world and being amazed by the strip malls the sizes of the roads and the plethora of car brands to be seen  in just the first chapter a bunch of foreign terms are flung at us like semana brahmin atman rigveda and om however they are tossed in without any rhyme or reason it feels as if hesse was trying to impress us with his research however it comes across as flat and immature for another analogy its as realistic as an american wondering about the meaning of life by contemplating the deceleration of independence the scarlet letter and the twilight saga  also the characters skin tones are compared to exotic foods  he became as pale as a dried banana skin   this is infinitely annoying thats like saying  rage erupted in her breast and her face became as red as koolaid   just as americans dont obsess over pepsi cnn or george washington a person living in this time period in india wouldnt obsess over mango trees or the vedas in his daily life  furthermore there is a simple but noble savage vibe that undercuts the whole story the prose is saccharine simplistic winnethepoohstyle writing that glosses over any sort of complexity in thoughts or feelings the characters have superficial emotions and spend the whole book posturing i cannot count how many times happiness erupted or sadness grew in someones heartbreast  i mean see for yourself  there was happiness in his fathers heart because of his son who was intelligent and thirsty for knowledge he saw him growing up to be a great learned man a priest a prince among the brahmins   or this one  for a long time govinda looked doubtfully at the friend of his youth then he bowed to him as one does of a man of rank and went on his way  smiling siddhartha watched him go he still loved him this faithful anxious friend   this next one made me angry given how severely it violates the laws of good literature there is so much namedropping it reminds me of gossip girls the keys of her cadillac were in her gucci purse not that i ever read more than a few pages of those books  but siddhartha himself was not happy wandering along the rosy paths of the fig garden sitting in contemplation in the bluish shade of the grove washing his limbs in the daily bath of atonement offering sacrifices in the depths of the shady mango wood with complete grace of manner beloved by all a joy to all there was yet no joy in his own heart dreams and restless thoughts came flowing to him from the river from the twinkling stars at night from the suns melting rays dreams and a restlessness of the soul came to him arising from the smoke of the sacrifices emanating from the verses of the rigveda trickling from the teachings of the old brahmins   its as if hesse was both overly respectful of and scornful towards buddhist foreigners at the same time shaping his fictional characters into simplewitted people who are nonetheless uncorrupted by modern society and at peace with nature goodness hesse dont you know humans are all the same why cant foreigners in literature be as passionate overwhelmed manipulative mirthful jealous and egotistical as characters from ones own continent  im sure there are more complex less exotified portrayals of buddhism out there you really wont be missing out on anything if you skip this one    if you for some reason do want to read siddhartha find a good translation because the standard one by hilda rosner is terrible not only is it filled with messy convoluted prose it fails at basic grammar  take the opening for example  in the shade of the house in the sunshine on the river bank by the boats in the shade of the sallow wood and the fig tree siddhartha the handsome brahmins son grew up with his friend govinda the sun browned his slender shoulders on the river bank while bathing at the holy ablutions at the holy sacrifices shadows passed across his eyes in the mango grove during play while his mother sang during his fathers teachings when with the learned men   the writing is atrocious i doesnt flow its a simple piece of description yet you have to read it multiple times to make sense of it  also the grammar is horrible lets look at a sentence from that paragraph  the sun browned his slender shoulders on the river bank while bathing at the holy ablutions   wait so the sun is browning his shoulders and bathing at the ablutions the sun is bathing  this is a common grammatical error called a misplaced modifier and it is often made by elementary school children it is a phrase or clause placed incorrectly in a sentence so that it appears to modify an unintended word in this case im sure rosner meant that siddhartha was bathing but because the sun is the subject of the sentence it comes across as if it were the one bathing  dont waste your money or time on a translation that reads as if it were written by a middleschooler with a thesaurus never in my life have i researched a book so extensively after finishing it i looked everywhere for any sort of indication that someone shared my thoughts on this book ironically i found two others who felt the same way i did on goodreads and with that i feel more confident in writing this review  there was an itch on my side while reading siddhartha that itch is attributable to two things that people perceived siddhartha as an accurate representation of buddhism or eastern philosophy and that siddhartha is not an accurate representation of buddhism or eastern philosophy though perhaps researched at best it just didnt sit well with me that a book that talks a great deal about the philosophy history teachings and virtues of buddhism was written by a person who was not buddhist in saying that i do not necessarily take issue with a person who writes about something that is beyond their realm of personal or lived experience but if you do not have the lived experience of something it is very likely that you will misrepresent or misconstrue it  furthermore siddhartha is perfectly packaged for nonbuddhists to read and still feel comfortable and unchallenged in their worldview and perspective the values and rhetoric it espouses still fits within the western values framework even though this book centres on eastern philosophy siddhartha was written to satisfy people who feel a cultural void in their life and who want a dose of something that is otherwise unobtainable and easy to consume siddhartha is a selfhelp book for the philistine  the writing style irked me hesses prose reads like how ignorant people appropriate and commodify foreign cultures to make themselves feel more cultured and he tries extremely hard to make the prose sound as spiritual and exotic as possible this sort of writing creates a gulf between the subject matter and the reader  to deliberately alienate the reader so that the reader can spectate siddharthas life as an outsider thereby reinforcing how foreign and intrinsically different everything is  from trees and people to way of life this is an exotification of the other  and the other is everything we read about in siddhartha i take issue with this because it is inherently dehumanizing  the characters arent really treated as humans with depth flaws and complex characters but are painted as caricatures of an orientialist fantasy  despite my qualms with siddhartha if i took a step back and told myself that this was not a book about buddhism there were some passages in the book that i could appreciate even if the tone was shallow pretentious and lofty at times hesse writes beautiful imagery that is both vivid and sublime light and shadow ran through his eyes stars and moon ran through his heart  is this revelation is this suffering is this resignation is this peace what resonates with one individual will be different for another despite my criticisms which i stand by with regardless if hesse had written about something else  something that was not inherently about buddhism  perhaps i would appreciate his writing more  if you ever do choose to read siddhartha read it for its narrative and the allegory do not go in thinking that this book is an accurate portrayal or representation of buddhism if you can overlook its inherent flaws and how pseudospiritual it tries to be there are nuggets of beauty to be found in this book and perhaps it may speak to you it just didnt so much for me  yeah this is pretty much the wet dream of nonbuddhist people who exoticize eastern cultures and religions by packaging them in a manner that fits the western cultural lens its very othering classic white dudes hot take on a culture thats not their own kind of writing i am not a fan of traditional british lit this is german lit translated to a britishlike style i get the bigger picture here be happy with what you have a peace will come to you i didnt need  pages of dreadful prose to get there  if this were about a modern american instead of a colonial indian it would be a completely different book and the meaning would disappear think about that  teenager tells his father i dont care that you set me up for a happy life im finding my own way no please stay we love you im leaving with my bff see ya they

daddy see ya im happy now man i live with this old guy on the beach and we surf an get high i found you now raise ur son ps im dead man my son ran away because i am a loser life is good fin  so long story short i didnt like siddhartha all through this book i was asking myself how could the yearold me love this patronizing badlytold simplification yuck this is a book thats wrapped up in a comfortable package that fits the western viewpoint on eastern religion and culture its point is to appeal to a lot of nonbuddhist fake intellectuals who want to achieve enlightenment by wasting as little time or thought on it as possible white man appropriates eastern religious thought to put forward a christian narrative  what a piece of surfacelevel shit i dont think i blame hesse as much as the english translation that became popular in the s and contributed to the fucking ridiculous condescension towards indian culture during that era  the only female character in this book exists for sex  to birth a child  then die fuck off  its such a christianinformed view of buddhismhinduismjainism buddhism is not a skin to put on top of your christian upbringing its a totally different way of looking at the world that hesse clearly did not understand  i want to write a counter book called jesus or how some dude named jesus who was around at the same time as jesus asked god yo man how do you not run out of space in heaven its a work in progress ill sum this up in one sentence thoughtless narcissist with delusions of grandeur  boring and condescending novel about an elitist selfabsorbed rich kid who thinks less of literally everyone around him and of course the only female character in the book exists purely to fulfill the main characters sexual fantasy for a book which is supposed to be about someone seeking enlightenment this book is surprisingly anti intellectual siddhartha has no desire or patience for knowledge of any kind even people who have taught him kammaswami kamala vasudeva the samanas he mocks and berates every single page i was reminded of how much of a supreme prick he really is  next this was no book for me i found it boring and condescending hesse tried really hard to transmit emotion and empaty but i felt none of those i could not finish it the second part made me so aggresive i just closed it sure there are some philosophy thoughts there but it is not like we havent heard those before the tedious story of a special snowflake of a man who went on the selfabsorbed quest of learning about the truths of life instead of being of any mortal use to the people who actually cared for him only finished it because i had to discuss it at my book club fortyodd years ago when everyone else my age was reading and quoting hesse at each other and me dammit interminably i kind of missed out i had perhaps three tries at the glass bead game but never got beyond about page  the turn of the year from  to  inspired me to redress this lack in my literary education so i doughtily pulled from the shelf siddhartha purchased somewhere a few years back and having the considerable merit of being shorter than his other books  oh my what a treat i have been missing all these years  telling the tale of a religious seeker who meets but does not become a disciple of the buddha instead wending his own merry way through thickets of cod philosophy this reads like the sort of book you expect to be given at airports by people in brightly coloured clothing the translation is either godawful or should have been copyedited take this from page  of my edition for a flavour of so much more     but today you have met such a pilgrim in such shoes and dress remember my dear govinda the world of appearances is transitory the style of our clothes and hair is extremely transitory our hair and our bodies are themselves transitory you have observed correctly i am wearing the clothes of a rich man i am wearing them because i have been a rich man and i am wearing my hair like men of the world and fashion because i have been one of them     and what are you now siddhartha     i do not know i know as little as you i am on the way i was a rich man but i am no longer and what i will be tomorrow i do not know  hands up anyone else whos reminded of that old mad magazine parody of longfellow in which hiawatha sets out to make a pair of gloves first he turned the skin side inside    and so on for about fifty similar lines in which the mittens are no closer to being completed  i suppose siddhartha was really the jonathan livingston seagull of its day  short pretentious ultimately empty seemingly designed for those who want to absorb just enough offtherack metaphysics to see them through an outburst or three of gastric upheaval hesse and i do not get along the only advantage this excruciating little read had over the torturous the glass bead game is its brevity  i am sure i am some kind of dullwitted philistine but this book just struck me as pretentious nonsense perhaps i am just too unenlightened to make head or tail of upanishadic ideals or perhaps it really is so much orientalist claptrap  and another thing can we please eliminate from the anointed canons of great literature each and every book in which women serve no role whatsoever save to provide sexual education for the male protagonist thank you ugh  that was torture especially the last  of it when i lost every ounce on interest in the thing  i often wonder how books get classified into classics vs old and forgotten but whoever deemed this book to be a classic does not have my vote well i dont get what the big fuss is this book felt like beating around the bush  the whole suffering part is the only thing that made sense and the book itself became a suffering after about  the dude had no focus he thought hes focused but he really was worse than a child who throws one colorful marble to grab another colorful marble  hesse maybe a great poet knows how to wield the language which is the only beautiful thing about this book but spirituality doesnt seem to be his strong hold  disappointed i read it many years agobut cannot remember any word i read i didnt understand anything such books are not my type so i didnt like it i read fantasy love stories dramas historical books but phylosophy is not my type i read it because when i was teen i was very interested in hinduistic culture collected everything i could find at home dressed in hindian women clothes saris but that book wasnt what i expected to be so i got disappointed maybe i was too young for such book you must get older to understand such books im just still too young buddha yes you know him samkyamuni samana passion women money no job satisfaction inner turmoil om love cures us all throw some random thatthva here and there oh and dont forget north indianised samskrit names govind siddhartha kamla kamaswami yada yada yada you get the drift dont you now build a story off the aforementioned cues congratulations you just pulled off a hermann hesse so why read this book again and waste your time  ps if you loved secret by rhonda  you will love this book selfcentered man seeks the true wisdom bails friends do what he wants but is never really happy i only found my true cynicism from this book this book was just so boring that it put me to sleep and i have insomnia seeing as how this book was on every single mustreadbooks list i had high expectations going in i read this book as part of a book club and if it werent for the book club i wouldnt have finished the book at all i fail to understand why this book comes so recommended  siddhartha is not someone i could relate to or understand from the very beginning he comes off as an arrogant man there is not enough background established before he becomes dissatisfied with his life as a brahmin and goes on to become a samana his time as a samana too is brief before he moves on to see buddha himself coming off of a single encounter with buddha he decides to experience samsara it is here that he spends the most time before again inevitably moving on to become a ferryman through all this time he seems to be searching for nirvana but his motivation for the same is never clear siddhartha moves from one thing to the next  hinduism to jainism to buddhism to  the lack of a motivation makes his entire journey seem false his actions and thoughts seem forced rather than natural or even genuine his encounter with every phase seems superficial  govinda his friend seems placed in the story only to make siddhartha look good he appears at every transitional phase in siddharthas life  seemingly as a comparison his motivations like siddharthas are also not mentioned his development as a character is completely contrary to his introduction he starts off as someone who admiresfollows siddhartha only to later just be a measuring scale for siddharthas achievements  which are supposedly off the charts  all in all a very disappointing read the author doesnt seem to have understood much of any of the religions he seeks to portray in the book perhaps it is his confusion that is shown as siddharthas but the lack of background and motivation makes it very difficult to empathise or relate to his confusion everything you hate about new age wisdom  oh boy i did not get on with this at all this is the story of an arrogant knowitall child who gets steeped in a poorly understood western idea of hinduism tells the actual buddha how to buddhism gets rich almost accidentally so he can have sex with a courtesan the author appears to think this incredibly simple become a gambling addict because hes too arrogant to appreciate anything he has and then decided the only way he can learn anything conveniently ignoring the many many moral lessons he should have learned already is to magic up the mysteries of the universe via one side conversations with an old man who may or may not be actual god and a river new age colonial nonsense from beginning to end youd be better off going and living in the woods yourself for a week for all the good it would do you a rather dreary novelisation of what hesse imagines buddhism to be about a sort of feelgood quietism with nothing to distinguish it from hinduism or the nonlethal forms of christianity there is no sense that he has read any serious buddhist texts or of the impact of the buddhas accepting disciples without regard to gender or caste or anything else distinctive to the teaching  a selfabsorbed piece of orientalist mental masturbation hesse goes in search of buddhism being german all he can find is hegel thoughtless narcissist with delusions of grandeur insufferable its not really a book about buddhism i think naming the main character siddhartha and having him meet the buddha and not be the buddha was simply to trick readers like me  i might have really loved this ten years ago when i was less familiar with the kind of soft poetic philosophy hesse does but theres really nothing here and only the fact that the buddha was not the main character kept me going since i realised this book was not what i expected it to be  its a terrible thing to take something meaningful another is trying to convey and simplifying it for the purpose of criticism and mockery but i did struggle to find any message in this book other than a reconfiguration of normative western values i always get annoyed trying to speak of anything slightly meaningful to my parents for example because they so readily speak in thoughtdestroying clichs  thats the way it is take the good with the bad life is hard but people are good  ultimately i believe this is all hesse was really saying here buddhism is a prop his exotic east window dressing im not really criticizing him too much for this  its tremendously difficult today to learn about buddhism as a westerner due to its long history disparate traditions and muddled osmosis this does not strike me as a book worth reading though  i learned that others have found this book tremendously meaningful which i found strange and almost frightening but perhaps that is because many like my parents will only hear what they already believe and dont really believe alternatives exist im embarrassed how harsh that sounds as though i am something superior but this book gives nothing taking about  hours to read that  hours of meditation would provide reminds me of the alchemist pedantic exposition stilted and wooden dialogue and nicely packaged quotes for teenagers to share with their friends to convince them they are deep the whole point of the book is that wisdom cant be taught it has to be gained through experience but as readers we experience precious little of siddharthas life except a few moments of transition the rest is glossed over in perfunctory exposition and generic prose it reads like the cliffs notes of a generic and condescending selfhelp book where the author throws himself softball questions to show us how smart and enlightened he is in addition theres something strange about what is supposed to be an eastern religious understanding filtered through a german protestant worldview it reeks of colonialism and cultural appropriation and misrepresentation this book is very popular people say it changed their lives but to me it was a drag to get through it was just so boring it follows siddhartha and his path to enlightenment but its a story i already understood and nothing about this added to the story or made me feel life changing as a matter of fact the book is more fiction then truth of the life of siddhartha as a matter of fact the part of the book where he makes a bunch of money gambling and lives a rich life as a merchant doesnt seem fitting at all its about giving up and living a minimal life and turns out that doesnt make for an interesting novel in my opinion   i really did not enjoy this read i was very antiascetic in high school for some reason and siddhartha really pissed me off strangely though i was mildly obsessed with demian in th grade  though i have no memory of actually reading it yeah youre so noble not eating the material world and our desires make us terrible people whatever  i doubt i would be so offended today but im still kind of a hedonist so maybe anyway i cant be bothered and at times siddharta even doubted whether this knowing this thinking were so valuable whether they were not childish things of the thought people the thoughtchildpeople in all other respects the worldlings were equal to the sage were often far superior just as at times animals in their tenacious unswerving necessary actions may seem superior to human beings  condescending exotified and nihilistic  this is the preferred depth of spirituality ive seen in many people who rebel at the idea of doctrines and who find themselves just a tad more enlightened than the rabble even as they may admire them for their animalistic simplicity and freedom from the burden of higher thinking ive met many of them they like to scoff at organized and in particular western forms of religion while believing themselves to be part of a chosen few who can see through all the bullshit in a way no one else can or as a guy i met last summer believes that they in shamanistic enligthement are chosen for a cosmic form of salvation and unification with a divine whole while the child people shall perish forever or suffer the torments of life as punishment over and over again seeing no correlation between these beliefs and the faith traditions he scorned  basically i was disappointed in this it came highly recommended and ive read and enjoyed hesse before but this felt like the spiritual equivalent of a smartass teenager who has become enchanted with a different culture and thinks everyone around them is dumb and dont get it  vasudeva was a good character and made it managable to get through this but overall i would only recommend this to people who are already condescending and wish to be more so i am glad people find something more in this than i did and i am sure theyll scoff at this review as not getting it which is ok id rather be with the child people
The Stranger,you know its quite impressive that camus managed to write a whole novel from the perspective of that guy who you always avoid at house parties i was told that this book improves with rereads and i think that might be true the book is split into two parts  part one is before the protagonist murders an arab for no real reason and part two is afterwards the first part is incredibly slow and dull and i think the translation doesnt do it any favours the second part however is much more interesting and the last few pages of the book are perfection it really makes you want to go back and read the first parts knowing what you know now i can see why so many people love this book with its philosophical questions existentialism nod to atheism etc  but for me he came across as depressed more than anything else its funny how our perceptions form our opinions on books even when we know our feelings on the book may not have been the intentions of the author  the ending was more sad than anything else although i can see why it might be breathtakingly liberating for some people odd little book easy to read well narrated in the first part something happens and in the second part the consequences are revealed the oppressive heat of the climate shadows every scene i read this book for the goodreads book club diversity in all forms if you would like to participate in the discussion here is the link   this book started off being weird and kind of confusing but it started making sense when it got to part two the main character was very unemotional and lived off of facts this book captured someone that understood the affects of what happened but didnt understand why you needed to get emotional about it it was a very interesting take on how to view the world i read this book for the goodreads book club diversity in all forms if you would like to participate in the discussion here is the link   this book started off being weird and kind of confusing but it started making sense when it got to part two the main character was very unemotional and lived off of facts this book captured someone that understood the affects of what happened but didnt understand why you needed to get emotional about it it was a very interesting take on how to view the world on a plot level reading the stranger is as exciting as watching your grandmother eat potatoes its a simple story about a nondescript man who does things randomly and routinely and he eventually goes to trial for an incident caused by the heat  though i didnt care about the characters or the plot the stranger did prove intellectually stimulating thematically its a deep book that raises questions ranging from whether society conditions our emotions to how we deal with the difference between absurdity and existentialism the last few pages of the book contained most of the mind meat doesnt that sound delicious so i recommend not giving up halfway even if youre not too entertained by the plot  overall not the best book ive read for school but one that works well in a socratic seminar or any type of discussion will probably come back to it when i have a greater understanding of philosophy  this book had a lot of potential but fell flat to me ive never taken a philosophy class but i feel like if i would have read this in supplement to talking about its deeper themes then i wouldve gotten along with it better but even after googling what about this is supposed to be so great i still didnt really find it to be very powerful  the writing was simplistic and i felt like the climax did the book justice but it wasnt hardhitting like i was expecting it to be however i realized half way through reading this that the ebook i borrowed of it and the physical format i had of it were vastly different translations and i found the translation by stuart gilbert was a lot more poetic and less i did this i thought this i think the meat of this book and what made it a classic is mostly contained in the final chapter thats where camus showed himself for the philosopher that he was i wasnt wowed by this book but it was interesting to read the main character is likable enough to the people around him but he drove me nuts because he is so passive he just says yeah okay to whatever anyone proposes he has also never learned the art of dissembling so he causes trouble for himself by always saying the bald truth in the most direct manner  im sure people have picked apart the final chapter ad nauseum but its another one of those pieces that will have completely different meaning for each reader depending on your beliefs at the time of reading  excellent translation by matthew ward i am humbled by the many insightful positive and beautifully written reviews of this book and feel a bit stupid for just not getting it but i dont i recognize intellectually that the stranger is important its messagelife has no meaningis brilliantly communicated i especially liked how all of the characters have a template to live by and they try to force their ideas onto the narrator but he consistently resists them other peoples purpose for existing has no weight for meursault we all die nothing matters so if i know the book is brilliant why wasnt i more affected doesnt brilliance make you think feel i dont know except to say that the narrator was so detached it made me detached as well i also reject the novels premise to me life is astonishingly rich and the beauty of the double helix makes me say yes in some deep way that i cant even articulate so the heart of this bookthat attending your mothers funeral killing someone and going to prison amount to the same thingdoesnt challenge excite or even threaten me i just end up thinking hmm interesting in a clinical kind of way all that said there are so many people i respect who love this book im embarrassed that i didnt respond to it more but look forward to reading the meursault investigation which is next on my list i realize that i have been very silent about my reading of this book in fact it was over  weeks ago that i read and discussed it with friends and i have somehow avoided finding time to write a review i suppose this reflects my ambivalence about the stranger i didnt actively dislike it but neither did i particularly care for it it may in fact be a victim of its own reputation since i have been aware of it for my entire adult life  to become more specific i simply found nothing to become involved with in the first half of the novel the sun appears to be as much a reason as any for a killing then in the second half there is more to become involved with powers that be are more annoyed with unrelated behaviors than the crime itself the portrait painted of a criminal is what is on trial not the man himself we know this dont we ive seen this before not long ago on the evening news every rape trial that has ever happened in fact  but still in spite of this pull of a message i could read and relate to on some level i could not relate to this novel there is something missing for me perhaps thats meant to be i first read this book back in art college i was a big fan of camus having read all of his major works one might say i was taken with existentialism although camus never wanted to be called that  that idea that one must live for the day seizing what one could enjoying and experiencing life as it happened i was young trying to become an artist and this idea sparked an interest in me  thirtyfive years have come and gone since then life happened and i have gotten older a lot has changed since then although i still do art and now a pandemic has shaken the world sheesh  one probably should read la peste the plague but i had this old french copy of letranger lying around and taking a break from a large book i thought why not  what did i think to be honest i was miffed and enchanted enchanted by camuss obsession with the glaring mediterranean sunlight i recalled my time in greece and could totally relate brilliant glaring sparkling intense light of the sun and the warm sea water i was surprised how much this was part of the book the atmosphere was always tense you knew something was going to happen  merseult even claimed the sun was the cause of the murder while he spoke to the prison chaplain he told him how he lived for the smell and sounds of nature it made him happy hard to argue with this  miffed because of the murder as merseult lived for the moment which also meant he couldnt lie he never told his girlfriend that he loved her didnt take the promotion in paris because he had no ambition and killed a man because it just happened he accepted his fate even after thinking he could get off that was hard to accept  it is still a classic i get what camus was trying to say that an honest man accepts things the good and the bad doesnt want more doesnt want less one accepts life after reading this now i can say i must disagree things happen and we try to make the best of it or are swept away with the consequences sounds good on paper life is never like that one could say a i was young and impressionable hopefully that doesnt mean that now i am old and disgruntled maybe i am i will accept this  i will give this a    my original review on goodreads which i gave a  stars  camus wrote a brilliant novel with his lead character as the quintessential existentialist i read this as a young man and this book spoke to the alienation i felt growing up even though i did not live in north africa the opening line still haunts me aujourdhui maman est morte ou peutetre hier je ne sais pas buddy read for november with the pantsless crew  this book should have been titled the man with no feeling  would you like to see your mothers body before we bury her no not really would you like to marry me sure why not would it matter if another girl besides me asked you to marry her no it wouldnt make a difference would you say this makes us friends sure i guess are you remorseful for killing a man no i cant say that i am do you want to repent for your sins no  this book was just ok for me maybe i missed the point somewhere i got the impression mersault may have been autistic but since this is never brought up in the book im going to take it for what it is  did i love this book no not really did i hate this book no not really is this how true literature feels  to feel it so like myself indeed so brotherly made me realize that id been happy and that i was happy still  albert camuss the stranger is a difficult one and while going through the journey it becomes obvious that there is a lot of depth and meaning in everything the words of albert camus has the liberating thought and feeling that freedom from the pain that i have been looking for it has that happiness thought that happy feeling that you can continue to have in spite of all the circumstances and situations that happen around you on which you do not have any control as such and most important of all the words of albert has that letgo thought  its alright to letgo it will all be alright whether you are around or not  the world will still go on as it is supposed to and has to thank you albert camus  that however miserable one is theres always something to be thankful for  people were starting on a voyage to a world which had ceased to concern me forever meursault was prefigured in  by turgenevs character from fathers and sons the indifferent bazarov and four years later by dostoevskys raskolnikov from the inimitable novel crime and punishment but whatever he shares with those russian creations one cannot help also compare camus protagonist to sartres antione roquentin from the latters  novel nausea of all these skeptical antiheroes mersault is the least memorable  meursault is most certainly an old fashioned nihilist even though camus described himself as antinihilistic and he fought against the label of existentialist thomas ligotti in his provocative nonfiction masterpiecethe conspiracy against the human racecleverly branded the algerian nobel prize winner a heroic pessimist and that seems rather fitting for the selfproclaimed absurdist  other writers books and philosophical labels aside letranger is fairly overrated it is short and though it does deal somewhat flippantly and indirectly with the meaning of life meursaults conclusion is that there is no meaning its not a particularly powerful piece of fiction meursaults motivation for his crime is not fleshed out and the reason for his pessimistic views are never given though these were creative choices and therefore completely purposeful they fail to add weight to the novella however camus efficiently elegant and succinctly nimble prose boosts the novel from its potential doldrums to something memorable and above average at least sometimes  i have never been able to grasp why camus implored us to find sisyphus happy i do not find him so camus was not brave enough to go as far as his philosophical ancestors and superiors like schopenhauer and cioran he was aware of the absurdity of human life but he had no logical answer for it his arguments against nihilism and suicide both fail because in camus work there really is no good argument we can find against either albert camus the stranger was supposed to be a novel about absurdism the only absurd thing is that we are expected to feel any kind of empathy with any of the characters there is almost a caricature like dislikability to them  the prime mover in this tragic comedy of mediocre people is meursault his mother dies and he goes to the funeral far to selfinvolved he bemoans the heat the other mourners presence the coffee etc he thinks only of himself the next day he goes to the beach with some idiot girl they hang out and decide to get married more to the point the girl decides meursault is ambivalent everyone from the main character to the womanbeating creep raymond the dogbeating neighbor and the cowardly arab vigilantes are all truly annoying people  when the murder happens there is a hint of the absurd in that it didnt need to happen meursault is such a tool that he does it in a haze ends up in jail and does a terrible job of making an impression thankfully he is sentenced to death and finally comes to understand his mother  this is one of those books often bandied about on the breaths of english majors and french people it was interesting and different but the characters are thoroughly awful people not necessarily evil but so banal as to make one wish for some personality even if it be evil interesting book glad i read itbut for my tastes give me voltaire short but thoughtprovoking book which is split into three parts at the start theres a death then theres a murder and the rest of the novel is the implications of said murder  the writing is great its a short book but the emotions are strong  my first albert camus read not my last i read this a while ago dont remember a whole lot from it so ill have to reread it for my rating to be accurate this book is told in two parts in the first part we follow our narrator as things happen to him he is quite indifferent to it all letting things occur around him with very little interest he gets a promotion his mother dies a woman decides she wants to marry him a neighbor asks for his help he murders someone within all these random events he exists without meaning as none of it has any meaning he doesnt seem to mind though then the second part is him dealing with the consequences of his actioninaction plus discovering himself through the varied perspectives of people in his life  i think there are two reasons why this book is called the stranger firstly how who we are our character personality traits etc is simply perspective as personality is a set of observable traits or actions who we are is determined by the perception of these observations if these actions are good or bad loving calculated logical emotional etc and for our narrator in particular as he sees everything as meaningless hes unable to form indepth relationships with people to paint a more accurate picture of his character he doesnt care about a promotion at work he wasnt close to his mom doesnt love the woman who wants to marry him doesnt really care that his neighbors are abusive he is a stranger to them all and the court system a weak attempt at order in all the random meaningless events tries to determine what kind of stranger he is  this isnt my favorite book but i think ill remember it for a long time i have to think about the book a lot because i have pretty mixed feelings about this i think i dont vibe with existentialism philosophy properly which is probably why every existentialist philosophy bookexcept crime and punishment gives me a pretty hard time understanding them properly without the least prejudice so i am giving it  stars the depiction of existentialism here is borderline nihilism imo the way he thinks that nothing has meaning in life everything is an endless void that just gives me an emo teen who hangs out on rnihlism vibes maybe im thinking this too much rationally or scientificallyand maybe im a very noob in philosophy but looking at his sexual impulse towards his fianceeig and thinking about how our hormones and neurons control our brain so much i was kinda hoping his sense of right or wrong shouldve been developed a little bit morality and ethics arent only a religious construct its also a social contrast even animals have a sense of protective ness and duty towards their tribe and family which shares their genes on the other hand i liked the religious talkor should i say onesided lecture between him and the police constablethe pastor it shows most peoples morality is maintained to attain the doors of heaven it also shows how the protagonists view toward his punishment when we exist in a world devoid of meaning why is it that our actions still bear so much weight a very strange book indeed and very captivating too in a light manner its as if everyone of us have felt like the stranger at some point of life if not always the detachment and sheer inability to believe in the grand philosophy of existence so far its the best existential fiction ive read moreover it is in such stark contrast to dostoevskys raskilnikoff that one cannot help but appreciate the novelty of the thought its the thought that counts and thats what makes this book a masterpiece through and through ps i was surprised to learn that french law kept guillotine in use for so long simply shocked perhaps not the best book to finish on christmas eve  the last chapter is amazing and exactly what i was hoping for with an existentialist novel the preceding chapters however were fairly blah for me things happen yes but i generally just dont care for meursault what happens to him and his actions his indifference toward everything though is grating perhaps another read in my future will hold different results i hadnt understood how days could be both long and short at the same time long to live through maybe but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another they lost their names only the words yesterday and tomorrow still had any meaning for me   the book itself isnt one i enjoyed it leaves you unsettled and uncomfortable and you cant fully put into words why every sentence feels detached even choppy almost at first i thought it was an issue with the translation but when i picked the book up in farsi which usually works well with french when english fails me i realized that thats kind of the point french philosopher sartre calls the sentences islands and hes right they feel separate from each other kind of just in the middle of nothing he says moving from sentence to sentence feels like moving from void to void and thats exactly what it feels like and this emptiness really bothered me i kept wanting to put the book down but i also sort of didnt  this emptiness or meaninglessness is echoed all throughout not just in each sentence but in the tone everything that happens and our main character every page when something happens it doesnt feel like something is happening no explanation of description of emotion is almost ever felt in this book the book literally opens with maman died today or yesterday maybe i dont know i dont remember feeling or reading anything about our main character feeling anything at all but i remember all the physical things the oppression of the heat the discomfort of his seat his exhaustion etc this is a theme that continues on every page is full of words but its only talking about the now the right in front of your face and nothing more as a reader i always want more it disorients you you read about death but you feel nothing you read about a relationship and you feel nothing you read about a murder and yet you feel absolutely nothing its almost confusing the sun in his eyes and the oppressive heat in that moment is what stays with you far more than the actual act of murder its uncomfortable  part i basically hints at how pointless everything is how not everything needs to have a meaning and part ii is all about people still trying to make sense of it maybe thats why i found the second half easier to get through because thats kind of what i was trying to do from the start of book i was trying to understand what was happening and why mersault in not so many words insists it doesnt matter none of it does were all going to die anyway  its not a fun read but thats not the point it leaves you thinking for quite a bit after i didnt enjoy it but again thats not the point  the point is there is no point   when i was first imprisoned the hardest thing was that my thoughts were still those of a free man for example i would suddenly have the urge to be on a beach and to walk down to the water as i imagined the sound of the first waves under my feet my body entering the water and the sense of relief it would give me all of a sudden i would feel just how closed in i was by the walls of my cell but that only lasted a few months afterwards my only thoughts were those of a prisoner  the trial was adjourned as i was leaving the courthouse on my way back to the van i recognized for a brief moment the smell and color of the summer evening in the darkness of my mobile prison i could make out one by one as if from the depths of my exhaustion all the familiar sounds of a town i loved and of a certain time of day when i used to feel happy the cries of the newspaper vendors in the already languid air the last few birds in the square the shouts of the sandwich sellers the screech of the streetcars turning sharply through the upper town and that hum in the sky before night engulfs the port all this mapped out for me a route i knew so well before going to prison and which now i traveled blind yes it was the hour when a long time ago i was perfectly content what awaited me back then was always a night of easy dreamless sleep and yet something had changed since it was back to my cell that i went to wait for the next day  as if familiar paths traced in summer skies could lead as easily to prison as to the sleep of the innocent  even there in that home where lives were fading out evening was a kind of wistful respite i found camus stubbornly maintained mersaults objectivity but at the cost of all humanity of the character this made it difficult for me to relate to him i also found his use of staccato dialogue although a clever device and inkeeping with mersaults character difficult to engage with at times most importantly i found that camus in the strangeroutsider depending on the translation highlights the limitations of his own philosophy which he had so brilliantly expounded in the myth of sisyphus in the myth of sisyphus the ability to accept ones life is an invitation to enjoy a greater number of experiences and not seek an easy escape from fate in the stranger camus manifestation of the theory in mersault represents a feckless abjectness which solely leaves the reader dejected that said it was an interesting read and certainly invokes an intellectual response hence the above quick reread before heading into the meursault investigation with one of my goodreads book groups still not thrilled with this book because i dont identify with the main character  hes pretty much the opposite of how i approach life  another difficult book to review its hard to be attached to a character who has no real attachments himself although certainly the absurdity of sentencing someone to death for not responding in correct ways is central to the story  but i guess i didnt feel like meursault achieved nonattachment or was so honest he rejected all attempts at artifice there are plenty of examples of him saying something that had he thought about it was demonstrably false but he never thought about those issues or about anything i never saw anything from him that was not reaction his lack of attachment to the world to me bordered on sociopathy not an ironic detachment but a real inability to feel anything to analyze anything to think his actions or their consequences through it went far beyond his lack of attachment to other human beings into a lack of attachment to his own actions nothing mattered to meursault  and so its hard to feel like the book mattered to me  and yet that is not a criticism i think camus achieved what he was trying to do he isnt looking to provoke extreme emotional attachment and how many times have i used that word so far the stranger made me feel as far and distant from the book as meursault felt from his world the stranger also known as the outsider or ltranger tells the story of meursault an unsympathetic french algerian who after attending his mothers funeral finds himself killing an arab man the novel follows a firstperson narrative that explores the events before and after this murder albert camus said is best when he said i summarised the stranger a long time ago with a remark i admit was highly paradoxical in our society any man who does not weep at his mothers funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death i only meant that the hero of my book is condemned because he does not play the game  on the surface the stranger is the story of an emotionless protagonist meursault does not care about anything and could be considered a sociopath however this novel is often cited as an example of camus philosophy on the absurd and existentialism so in order to fully grasp the intent behind this classic novel we must look into just what existentialism is and more practically absurdism  the absurd is often referring to the conflicting philosophy that humans have a tendency to seek out value and meaning in life however absurdism believes it is logically and humanly impossible to find any meaning of life philosophers may have very different doctrines but they generally believe that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject though existentialism comes from the disorientation or confusion that we are living in a meaningless or absurd world  for albert camus the stranger is an exploration into the meaning of life and if life has no meaning what is the purpose of morality meursaults detachment from the world is a result of his conclusion that life is meaningless the chaplain knew the game well too i could tell right away his gaze never faltered and his voice didnt falter either when he said have you no hope at all and do you really live with the thought that when you die you die and nothing remains yes i said paradoxically it was only after being sentenced to death that meursault was able to obtain some sense of happiness  without an understanding of albert camus philosophical ideas i do not think that the reader will have any hope in truly understand or appreciating this novel however i have heard that the stranger has been an option for high school students especially in america to study i wonder how many students fall into the trap of picking this novel thinking it was short only to discover how difficult it is to analyse i do not have enough of an understanding of absurdism or existential philosophy to full appreciate the stranger however rereading this novel has helped me understand this enough to enjoy the camus philosophical ideas i started this book finally understanding that it was an example of existentialist philosophy but knowing little else i began reading and immediately felt lost in the randomness of it all in the detailed descriptions of settings and the truncated passages dealing with human exchanges it was like i was a pinball being randomly thrown about much like the protaganist though he had more input than he would likely admit i finally had my lightbulb moment realized that this was the point and began to enjoy the read for what it was there were a lot of things that i agreed with from the bookmany things dont matter to the universe there is no god etc etc the one thing though that he failed to understand is that you yourself can attribute meaning to anything who cares if it means something to someone else who cares if the universe is gone billions of years from now spend your life how you choose but also within the parameters of the state you live in its your only life it wont matter once youre dead but do you want to spend it locked in your own mind and cell this was a bit of a ramble and not necessarily a cogent review nonetheless its my thoughts and therefore important to me thats all that mattersto me
Goodnight Moon,who doesnt love rhyming verse  a delightful and enchanting nighttime poetry book to calm the soul goodnight mittens kittens and the red balloon  my buddy readers said  stars and then changed to  when the scale was explained margaret wise browns nihilistic classic is a howling renunciation of god here depicted as a quiet old lady whispering hush there is no afterlife here no reward no release from the crushing mundanity of life there is only the bowl of pathetic mush the forlorn mittens the abandoned balloon the telephone that never rings we live our lives in a great green room but at the end we accumulate nothing but the discarded trappings of our childhoods even love cannot offer solace where are our families when the end comes goodnight nobody we call into the blackness  there is no hope in the world without us we know what will happen when we close our eyes to the young mouse left alone with two kittens they will toy with him they will torture him and leave his decapitated body on our pillow but we will never awake to see its guts splayed out near our heads goodnight air the poem ends goodnight noises everywhere we fall silently into the void after receiving this much beloved classic as a birthday gift from his grandparents it instantaneously became a mustread every night for our son during his toddler years i remember his sweet little voice  like it was yesterday  repeating the words goodnight moon goodnight cow jumping over the moon with us as we read it to him a delightful book for the ages a great man in his pride    casts derision upon supersession of breath he knows death to the bone man has created death  william butler yeats    goodnight moon    goodnight air goodnight noises everywhere  margaret wise brown   theres only one time in your life that you say goodbye to everything youve come to know and love    and even dedicate a little time saying goodbye to the things youve come to hate the shitty bowl of mush growing cold on the night stand that your old lady tries to pass off as food the filthy rodent thatll probably leave droppings in said mush as you rest comfortably eternally because when youre about to kick off even the fecal matter your little brother leaves on the toilet after he forgets to wipe his butt is endearing and the tasteless formless garbage your nation has sold to you as food reminds you thats its better to have the faculties to hate and loathe than to have nothing at all  most classic poets painted death with a palette of the morose and depressing there was no room for clich rhymes and red balloons in the classic written rendering of death until margaret wise brown came into the picture in  brown threw out all the conventions established by previous poets writing about death bidding folks like yeats and donne to say goodnight air as she peppered her death poetry with balloons bears and cows jumping over the moon  her work reminds us that death does not have to be a subject of woe death is best reminisced about with a cocktail of kittens and mittens chairs and bears the proverbial spoonful of sugar brown gives to us with her stylistic rendering helps the medicine go down as it were continuing the discourse established by her predecessors and taking it in a direction desperately needed by people today this is not just a book about a stubborn rabbit with ocd who will not go to bed until he lists everything in his room this is a story about the human condition and a celebration of our greatest collective vulnerability read this shit wonderful book that makes you feel that everything will be fresh and new in the morning this is the bedtime story i also think this book could be very helpful if you have a small child is afraid of the dark by reassuring the child that everything is the same even when the lights are out it may be just the story to help them overcome their fear in the great green room there was a child and a red broom and a book of a bunny saying goodnight to the moon and there were two sleepy parents sitting on chairs and a giant yawn awaiting the future dawn   goodnight room goodnight moon goodnight sleepy parents goodnight broom goodnight child goodnight book goodnight air goodnight sleepy readers everywhere both hubby and i read over and over to our daughter amanda for years a common parental experience for sure and such a lovely little book for everyone touched by it what is about this book that haunts me is it the deep sense of emptiness that the room stays the same but objects move and light slowly fades into dark that the narrator has no connection at all with the only other human the old lady whispering hush  or is that that the narrator says goodnight to nobody that as we go outside her room we see only stars  no people no cities its as if this little bunny is the last one on earth and is being watched by some robotic nanny bunny  i get the chills reading it and i wonder if cosette will pick up on it she loves it too but probably because of the red balloon and two kittens the baby bunny is oddly unengaged with a temperamental grandma bunny as he or she watches the room grow darker even though the moon rises despite these inconsistencies and occasional strange reading cadences goodnight nobody what does that mean i would recommend book to anyone interested in going to bed at night and suffers from separation anxiety with inanimate objects a little bunny tucked in bed says goodnight to all the familiar things in his great green room the fireplace is burning the lights are on as the little bunny says goodnight by the end of the book the lights are out and the moon is shining through the window little rabbit says goodnight noises everywhere  this ingenious book settles down the little ones for bed the full page illustrations alternate between boldly colorful layouts to small black and white pictures the texts is simple and direct i recommend this book i have read this to all my kids right before bed its a favorite even my older girls would stay to listen while i read to their younger brother this book holds a special place in my heart my mother used to read it to my brother and me all the time when we were younger until she grew so tired of it that she bought it for us on cassette and we played it enough times that the tape became messed up the illustrations are phenomenal the wording light and simple its something we can all relate to saying no goodnight to anything and everyone just to prolong our bedtime im glad that at the ripe old age of  i bought my own copy i have read this to my daughter since she was two months old she is now  months old going on  months and i have to say that i grown to appreciate this book this is not only due to the enjoyment she gets or because the little rabbit procrastinates going to bed like my little one does no like all great childrens literature this book has a couple of layers i enjoy this book because i think its about a childs version of death im not crazy  promise maybe its the perplexing old lady whispering hush or maybe its the goodnight nobody page but i think there is something else going on here with this book or maybe its because ive read it so often i need to think on a different level as i read this so simple yet simply perfect  does anyone actually read this book silently to themselves it demands to be spoken its a great bedtime story it always ends with the whole family telling each other goodnight so sweet a truly fascinating vision of the fading of the american consciousness the perfect book for bedtime for littles a classic i choose this book as its widely regarded as a classic childrens book although it is considered to be a bedtime story a rhyme about a childs bedtime ritual of saying goodnight to everything they can see from their bed i believe that the short rhyming couplets about subjects that most children would be familiar with make it an ideal book for building literacy skills although the edition i read was a board book it is also availbe in paperback and hardback formats which would probably be more suitable for a school setting as children tend to think that board books are for babies and will avoid them on that basis ive offered to read this book to my nieces and nephews at bedtime on a number of occaisions and it never gets refused  although the illustrations are maybe not as sophiscated as in more modern books i think they are probably just as enchanting for a child today as they were for a child over  years ago when it was first published in each of the wideangle illustrations of the bedroom everything mentioned in the text is visable even though it may take a little searching for this is a great way to encourage a child to relate the illustrations to the text the colour scheme of the illustrations is also very unusual but interesting and sets the style of the book apart from its more modern counterparts   all in all i think that this book is a charming timeless and classic childrens book that should be a staple of any childs library wow this book was chilling  never has the feeling of being so close to sleep been described so well minor spoiler but the page where the main character says goodnight nobody really filled me with existential dread who is nobody does the character know this person who am i  definitely recommend to those looking to be shaken to their core can anything truly be said to speak with less than lavish rhapsodic adoration of margaret wise browns classic childrens book  just as mothers and their babes in arms have the uncanny ability to synchronize their heartbeats by a single loving glance the lyrical cadence and soothing repetitive text makes reading goodnight moon a compulsive act of gentle rocking motion lulling the reader into an involuntary ebb and flow the words of the bedtime story fall from the lips as a lullaby it is impossible to keep a harsh edge from ones voice from dissolving into the tender rhythm  of the nearly one hundred books written by margaret wise brown goodnight moon is notably one of her most beloved the late clement hurd was best known for his work illustrating goodnight moon his charming collaboration launched his career as an illustrator of childrens books the bold orange and green that blankets each page coupled with simple recurring stripes disappear slowly into darkness as the charming little bunny fights sleep the true miracle of goodnight moon is in its uncanny ability to conjure sleepiness in children hell find himself rubbing his eyes and allowing you to roll him into his bed and under a warm quilt by the last page i bet most households have a copy of this book my mother read it to me when i was very young the pictures are so vivid and the rhyming is such fun  i dont have my original copy but i do have two that i picked up when i came across them in book stores and i still smile as i look at the pictures and read the rhymes aloud  such a lovely bedtime story a classic that never gets old and all ages will enjoy  i own a copy of this book my review is voluntarily given this is one of my alltime favorite childrens books good for easing toward bedtime easy rhymes wonderful brightlycolored illustrations with lots of variation as the book progresses such great memories of reading this to my children and then to my grandchildren they all loved looking for that little gray mouse damn good book for little tuckered out boys like me this quirky book is a fun way to teach little ones how to read the surprises in the book are a memory aid and the rhyming sounds are appealing i like the colorful illustrations it was a good idea to make use of iconic nursery rhymes in the text and pictures in a fresh way for example the cow jumping over the moon the whole concept of the book speaks to childrens imaginations on their level bunny is an adorable character in the book he says goodnight to everyone in the green room even the mush  suzy davies author of sleepy animals bedtime book of baby animal story poems illustrated by laurie shanholtzer and luna the moon pig the pig who hid a cartoon bedtime book illustrated by sheila graber in a great green room tucked away in bed is a little bunny goodnight room goodnight moon and to all the familiar things in the softly lit room  to the picture of the three little bears sitting on chairs to the clocks and his socks to the mittens and the kittens to everything one by one  the little bunny says goodnight i put off rereading this for a long time because i worried that such a simple book couldnt live up to my memory of it but it does the gentle intimate pacing of quiet goodbyes the lived dynamic cozy room with nowiconic art and color palette the gradually deepening shadowsits as comforting as i remember the goodnightstyle picture books that i didnt grow up with have largely failed to impress me so im certainly influenced by nostalgia but this is the original and its aged impeccably omg i still love this book i read it to baby carmine last night during reading time and he didnt understand much if anything but as he gets older i think we will say goodnight to everything love it started a new bedtime routine and this seemed appropriate to read its such a cute little nighttime book
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter, #2)",okay duh  stars i actually liked this book more than i remembered this used to be my least favorite of the harry potter books and while that still might be true i was more entertained than i expected i always forget how different book ginny is from movie ginny way better all around and how she has such a bigger role in the books than the films  now onto hp and the prisoner of azkaban jk rowling really knows how to write a great book thats for sure although this wasnt my favorite book in the series it definitely wasnt because it was bad i loved the plot and conflict even though it wasnt as intense as the others were i was definitely shocked at the endso epic and mind blowing it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities  what can i say that hasnt been said before about this series what words can do this book justice ive felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as ive read them i didnt experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here but in some ways i think its just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood i have kids so i was constantly wondering how my  year old will accept these books when shes a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes  the holidays are always a busy stressful time for us all of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and on top of that were moving into our new place this month all i could think about was how desperately i wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day and this was the perfect book to do so with no matter your age the magical world of hogwarts is truly spectacular the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you werent sure existed for us old farts anymore if you have been hiding under a rock for the past  years like i have i highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like i did time is a precious commodity these days and you couldnt spend it in a better way than with these precious kiddos i love this book of course i do but the fact remains that this book prominently featured two of my most hated harry potter characters ginny weasley and dobby there i said it i hate them both in my harry potter hate list ginny and dobby probably rank somewhere below umbridge and peter pettigrew yeah you heard me i hate them that much  the reason i hate ginny iswell never mind i dont want to start another shipping war here the last one was terrible enough so let the reason for my hatred be implicit and unsaid  dobby is freaking annoying yo all his eagerness and shit  and yeah i know what happens in the end doesnt matter i still hate dobby dobby is the equivalent of fingernails on chalkboard for me if he had been my elf id have given him a sock already so he could his whimpering sniveling ass out of my life he means well i know he does its just that hes such a frustratingly wellmeaning bumbling idiot you know what harry if he doesnt stop trying to save your life hes going to kill you aaaaaaaand one final note ginny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain no particular reason i included that except for the fact that it reminded me of my exboyfriend  my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen the best of us must sometimes eat our words  every time you loved the first book of a series and then start reading the second  eagerly waiting for the story to continue  theres always the apprehension that things might not be as great as the first well chamber of secrets will convince you otherwise everything keeps getting better  have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong  i was glad to find everything i loved about the first book still applicable to the second itll be a bit redundant if all those plus points were to be repeated here but still i cannot refrain from mentioning how easy it is to read the story in no way im implying that the narration is plain or just too simple  for it is definitely not the case  but it is just one smooth flow the story itself is much more detailed than the first one mainly because setting up of environment and characters were done in the original though i didnt feel so before in retrospect the first book now feels like an introduction to the series and this as the first real adventure  it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities  and again its impossible not to start reading the next one immediately  regrowing bones is a nasty business reread audio    okay im going to do a little spoilery in this review so those of you that havent read the book then you might just want to look at the pictures i have picked a ton of pictures from the book but believe me there are plenty more beautiful ones in the book plus if your a harry potter fan you will be getting the book anyway if you havent already      so poor harry is stuck back with the dursleys on privet drive and even though harry is a relative they still treat him like poo because hes magical ewwwwww  harry is depressed because he has be cut off from talking to his friends or getting any kind of correspondence even poor hedwig has been locked in her cage and hasnt been able to fly around cruel but harry cant use magic inside the muggle world  then harry meets doby  the little houseelf that is waiting for him in his room      it turns out that doby has been intercepting his correspondence because he fears for harrys life and doesnt want him to return to hogwarts so doby causes some problems at the house that get harry in trouble i had to add this cute little picture of doby running off look at his little butt lol       then one night ron george and fred pull up outside harrys window in their dads flying car to save harry its pretty funny how they get it all going but that is okay as long as harry gets away from his evil relatives      of course mrs weasley is not pleased when they get back home the sneaking out part didnt work very well but she welcomed harry with open arms and he stayed with them until it was time for them all to go back to school      i love that picture of the weasley house   life at the burrow was as different as possible from life in privet drive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleys house burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and georges bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at rons however wasnt the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him  poor sweet harry and i would love to live with the weasleys for a bit   look at cute fat little scabbers       the kids are going to meet hermione to get some shopping done but ole harry takes a wrong turn down the chimney hole and ends up in some creepy shop he hides and gets to hear some things malfoy and his father are talking about      finally harry makes it out of the store and hagrid finds him and gets him to the right place with his friends      then ron and harry are blocked from getting on the train soooooo back to stealing the flying car      and of course they get into trouble when they get to hogwarts but it wasnt anything too bad  snape looked as though christmas had been cancelled he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree    surely acts of this nature    it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boys punishments severus said dumbledore calmly they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva ive got to give out a few notices come severus theres a deliciouslooking custard tart i want to sample  there is a new defence against the dark arts professor named gideroy lockhart hes a bit off but still         anyway things are not right at hogwarts are they ever and harry and the gang must figure out whats going on  poor ole hagrid gets sent off to azkaban for something he didnt do      malfoy is a jerk as if we didnt know that lol      harry and ron go out in the woods to meet aragog the spider that is friends of hagrid to find out some truth behind some stuff      comes to find out there is this diary of a person named tom riddle im not telling you who this person really is but they are the one causing all kinds of trouble for a lot of people  in the end harry has to end up fighting a basilisk to set things right he has the help of the sorting hat for reasons dumbledores phoenix and a sword oh happy day              there is loads more to the book then the things i have described but you can just read it and if you havent why havent you harry potter rocks and always will  there is another happy ending for sweet doby       harry gives dobby his stinky sock so this releases doby he now has his freedom from the evil lucius malfoy woot  come dobby i said come but dobby didnt move he was holding up harrys disgusting slimy sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure master has given dobby a sock said the elf in wonderment master gave it to dobby whats that spat mr malfoy what did you say dobby has got a sock said dobby in disbelief master threw it and dobby caught it and dobbydobby is free lucius malfoy stood frozen staring at the elf then he lunged for harry youve lost me my servant boy but dobby shouted you shall not harm harry potter there was a loud bang and mr malfoy was thrown backwards he crashed down the stairs three at a time landing in a crumbled heap on the landing below he got up his face livid and pulled out his wand but dobby raised a long threatening finger you shall go now he said fiercely pointing down at mr malfoy you shall not touch harry potter you shall go now lucius malfoy had no choice with a last incensed stare at the pair of them he swung his cloak around him ad hurried out of sight  this book is wonderful it always has been and always will and the graphics in this book make it even better  it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities  and here i go with another one of my short my thoughts about this book reviews i cant believe that i forgot so many things like for instance the fact that dumbledore actually was a transfiguration teacher before he became headmaster kinda suitable that this is mcgonagalls role now    harry potter asks if he can help dobby  dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew  aww dobby it was so good to see him again hes really one of the best hp characters ever and this even though he made it kind of tough to like him lol well at least at the beginning poor harry xd   your sons flew that car to harrys house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right ii mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasleys eyes thatthat was very wrong boys  very wrong indeed   ill always love how mr weasley is more interested in finding out if the car flew well than in his kids actually flying the car lol also molly weasley giving him hell for not reacting the way a responsible parent is supposed to is just epic haha those two you can see they have a great marriage p   mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools  how could i forget that mr weasley threw himself at malfoy one of the best things in this book ever not that i support violence im a pacifist but even i cant help appreciating that lucius malfoy for once actually had his ass handed to him xd   that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris well have peeves out this time my sweet  how come i never noticed this before the foreboding omg like damn there are so many things that are mentioned only briefly and rather casually and then when you continue to read the series they reappear with a vengeance oo with every book i read im more and more awed by jk rowlings genius   homework compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of the best one  gilderoy lockhart is so full of himself i swear he must have been the worst dada teacher they ever had and they had many over the years which even dumbledore cant deny loved that bit at the ending when he said hed have to write an ad because they seem to run through them lol   you are muggleborn halfblood sir said riddle muggle father witch mother  there definitely was a history lesson hidden in there its fascinating how riddle of all people could be a halfblood and then go against muggle born wizards im sure jk rowling thought about world war ii when she wrote this because all the pureblood and halfblood etc stuff reminds me of a very dark chapter in german history    but whys she got to go to the library because thats what hermione does said ron shrugging when in doubt go to the library  did anyone notice how well ron knows hermione and how often he defended her in this book i mean he actually would have fought malfoy with his bare hands if harry and dean would have allowed it its so obvious that ron cares about her deeply to vomit snails without complaining about it should count as the ultimate indication of eternal love and affection lol   of course she said and harry amazed saw a tear glistening in her beady eye  mcgonagall losing it was another great moment in this book when you least expect it she always shows some kindness and heart and to be honest this never ceases to amaze me xd shes a great teacher and im not surprised that she always takes over when dumbledore isnt around   youre in luck said harry forcing lockhart to his feet at wandpoint we think we know where it is and whats inside it lets go  i just love harry okay lol for such a young kid he certainly has a lot of guts and courage the way he dealt with lockhart i think not even an adult wizard could have done it any better xd the sheer audacity to demand aid from him like that yes haha    voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruck  i cant believe rowling already mentioned this in book two i mean harry quite literally said that voldemort put a bit of himself in him a part of his soul its so obvious that harry is a horcrux gah its all there and i never saw it thats just brilliant dumbledore must have known all along i really need to reread the entire series because i cant remember if he already knew it right from the beginning or if it was just a theory at first  i cant wait to read the prisoner of azkaban im afraid it might have to wait until next year though so many books so little time  bedtime reading for my daughter and second reading for me it is once again exciting to wander across the hogwarts halls observing the mysterious facts that involve the protagonists just like we were there too this is rowlings rare gift making sure that we see through the eyes of harry ron and hermione  the summer holidays have passed and the new school year is about to start at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry harrys power is still immature but dumbledores teaching is adamant  it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities this time our young wizards are struggling with the new professor of defense against the dark arts the dork and vein gilderoy lockhart called to replace professor quirrell died in the previous adventure however the joyful atmosphere is soon ruined strange events begin to happen far be it from me to spoiler something of this mysteryfantasy jk rowling gives us another masterpiece to live rather than to read actually i do not know if my daughter was more pleased than me to hear this novel or if i was happier than her to read it and literally interpret it i even modulated the voices of the different characters any excuse to read harry potter i sat down to read a few pages of this before bed two nights ago and had to force myself to stop at page then picked it up and flew through the rest the next day  i really enjoyed this one as did millions of others obviously and with this installment i am definitely seeing why this is such a beloved series the magical wizarding world of harry his friends and the folks at hogwarts is just fun to read about  i am in love with fawkes the phoenix and i adore dumbledoreand now i am so worried something bad is going to happen to one of them over the course of the remaining books  description  and yes i know its probably made you gasp in shock that  in addition to never having read the books before now  i have also never seen any of the moviesand i truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series  i guess it is possible to blissfully ignore spoilers for over two decadesunless we are talking about game of thrones good luck making it a fucking day with all the assholes posting every single scene on twitter  description  not that im on twitter  but i digress  so yeah firstly loved this book and looking forward to the next one  and secondly now more of the art on the hp mug i got from owlcrate a few months ago makes more sense and i totally love it more now so theres that  description  winning all around i read this all in one  hour sitting i need a life i am always surprised by jk rowlings ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and its big and hideous problems we all know after all that she covered discrimination wars hate crime the kardashians etc  lets take this book for example harry goes back to hogwarts now enter gilderoy lockhart a fame enamored charlatan who knows nothing about anything except memory spells so clearly a kardashian now some might ask do kardashians know memory spells and the answer is clearly yes keeping up with the kardashians is already on season  so some magic must be at work otherwise youd have to think the world has gone mad  carrying on harry has an awful year mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language actually all of harrys life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you hence harry mightve been modeled after lindsay lohan but rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that harry ended up fine in the end mostly  and to crown all of this awful year he meets tom riddle who is the heir of slytherin he also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet so definitely a forefather of taylor swift and look at what that those family ties made her do lessons to be learned from here people  now of course a lot of questions remain will the kardashians magic still work for long will taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa will i finish this review already  only time can tell  while this is probably one of my least favorites of the series its still a fantastic book i cant say for sure why i dont love it as much as the others but its just never stood out to me  however upon rereading it i am reminded again how great rowling is at developing a story arc there are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book especially with tom riddle showing up the diary hints of rons affection for hermione and overall just building up the characters and storyline its also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on  here are some thoughts on things i noticed or didnt remember about this book while i was reading it like in one of the harry potter video games ron and harry degnome the burrows garden at the beginning of the book hermiones parents actually go to diagon alley and exchange muggle money at gringotts why wasnt nearly headless nicks deathday party in the movie also he died in  which is when columbus discovered america significant and some old witch in bath had a book that you could never stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything onehanded p sounds familiar i really wish they had the valentines day party in the movie with all the dwarves walking around dressed as cupids and delivering love messages aragog is literally my biggest fear apparently dumbledore back in the day was a transfiguration professor at hogwarts and finally i knew voldemort was an heir of slytherin duh but i didnt realize he was the last heir of slytherin dun dun duuuun this one is beyond amazing delightful mysterious  cute my favourite book in the middle gradeish side    of hp i enjoyed every moment of it every time every page has something new  im always wondering why this beautiful cute exciting mysterious full of backstories  plottwist book is so many peoples least favourite one in the series we have the history of hogwarts now now not hogwarts a history people we have some other important backstory voldemort  his past we have weasleys  we have dobby it is the cutest  no one can tell me otherwise  tbh all of them are magical  wonderful my heart beats for them   second book starting with a blow can i appreciate the beginning of the book the first chapter the title how it is started how it summarized the events of the last book  let us swim in this world once again craving for magic every hp book started with a recap of the last books probably the only series i saw to mentioned previous events very unique  fun for example   harry potter wasnt a normal boy as a matter of fact he was as not normal as it is possible to be   how suddenly everything goes wrong in this book wizarding world expanded more into this world how a wizard family actually live the amazing weasleys we meet new great characters we didnt know in the first book like mr weasley also more fred  george  mrs weasley full of intriguing backstories mysteries histories riddles  plot twists mystery  horror many fun moments thanks to ron dont forget young harry being sassy  how could everyone characters i mean idk about the fans but i know i myself couldnt believe that think of harry like that being the one who attacked students just because he is a parseltongue hes not pureblood mania like malfoy dammit his friend is a muggleborn he is a good guy tho i always enjoy to see my favourite characters under pressure gives me the excitement guilty pleasure  i think im the only one who likes lockhart not much but still i mean he was annoying  everything a liar  actually a fraud sure but hilarious  stupid he made the scenes funny because of his nonsense megalomaniac  of course harry  rons expression toward him oh one more thing i love tom too i love villains in disguise  we didnt know until the end of the book that he was fooling us all  brave young harry saved the day im proud of him reading hp to ring in the new year may be a new tradition of mine since ive done just that two years in a row  i havent read this book since the first time i read it in th grade but i loved it i never would have thought before that cos was one of my favorites from the series but i stand corrected  dont trust too easily   unexpected grumpy people could mean everything in the end    have a lifesaving nerdy friend like hermione at all costs    i cannot get over rons moms letter  literally made my ears bleed and that diary my life wont be the same again   the character which made me laughed out loud many a times without them meaning to was hermione surprising not because shes that chatty but the way some lines were written about her that made me squeal because of how nerdy she could be  read every book in the library before christmas  hermione took nobodys advice but signed up for everything i mean  harry but whys she got to go to the library ron because thats what hermione does when in doubt go to the library  another bookish quote relived  i cannot believe i had this much patience in me to give more than a year gap after reading the first book  damn   you are making me shine all over again  bless you book   fantasy mystery adventure done right  the way it has been written is so simple that its just impossible not to enjoy everything is so damn vivid and entertaining things are wellbalanced there arent anything underwhelming or overwhelming parts i have come across this series  i watched the entire movie series adaptation years ago and thankfully none of it made sense that time and i am so glad i cannot remember anything happening there except for the actors faces in my head while reading the books  i loved the first book it was so much better than watching a good movie i could feel the action adventure and the dialogues more with the book  and this sequel is amazing as heck too  i feel the first half was a bit slow but its the second half that got the legs of my imagination run its winning race until the end  malfoy is annoying bless him the spells are happening real more strict rules to break and of course hermione and ron are becoming more endearing with harry not smiling at all because hes harry potter dumbledore you never fail to impress me i wish there were more parts of the characters but its fine i wasnt bored even for a moment there   the entire read was a fun fest for me  i woke up knowing its sunday the reading gods cast a spell on me at  am and i started reading the book and now i feel magical  i am feeling so proud of the characters including the jerks and the scoffing teachers at hogwarts i say nothing would have been this perfect without any of you   there are more dramatic characters in this one the ghosts the side charactersand i dont think i will ever get to see a detailed story description of anyone belonging to my house hufflepuff i know we are all slytherin here but i need to know a hufflepuff soon  are you there in     or the dreaded th its actually quite fascinating how much happened in this book to be honest even though its a star read because nostalgia trumps logic at times this is my least favourite in the series i prefer the movie adaptation  yeah i said it i always re read hp when i start the year instead of actually reading other books lmao will i ever learn i dont think so still a five star read i still love lee jordan brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying car right into the whomping willow peoplell be talking about that one for years description  we are introduced to one of my all time favorite characters dobby  description  theres still lots of great quotes even though most will only make sense for those whove read the book  it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities  never trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain  well youre expelling us arent you said ron not today mr weasley snape looked as though christmas had been canceled  when in doubt go to the library  the characters are still amazing with a lot of humorous oneliners this might be the only series where i at least close to love every character  of all the trees we couldve hit we had to get one that hits back  honestly if you were any slower youd be going backward  and the storyline is absolutely fantastic jk rowling truly has a magical imagination  short review if you can even call this a review because im heading strait in to harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the adventures in this great lovely book were bipolar on one hand they are exciting beyond comparison on the other hand they dont stem from logical roots  the foreshadowing about a lot of stuff ongoing at hogwarts is a huge plus both its predecessor and its successor are better than cos but i found it better than all the books after goblet of fire  the name hogwarts makes sense but in french it translates officially as louse of lard anyway this is a very innocent version of the potterverse where ginny is likable and the burrow so organic  ill never forget why mr weasley decided to fight lucius malfoy its because of his love of muggles trust rowling to include that poignant snippet in the middle of all those action and red herrings after the last book i read i thought i deserved a treat and decided to read the second hp book and true to everyones claim i enjoyed and savored every single page on which everything written magically fits one another exactly like the  year old me dreamed of the experience was ten times better when i used professor mc gonagalls voice to read the entire thing lol most of what i said in my review of harry potter and the philosophers stone can also be applied to this installment in the series the writing style was easy to read but not simplistic in the slightest its definitely a book that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their age the world unsurprisingly was magical and the characters so incredibly lovable i also really liked that there a bit more insight into the school lessons than in the first one i dont think i need to say more  these books are just an absolute mustread rowling confirms that the first book was not a fluke the harry potter series is the real deal with compelling characters action and adventure multidimensional characters you can love and hate all wrapped up in a fascinating created world i get the impression that this must have been a thoughtful challenge for jk rowling to write the chamber of secrets must have been a nearly impossible task sadly though its worth  stars its less good than its predecessor  but in the wake of the thicker harry potter books cos has got very much underrated it has several flaws and problems with veracity that does not mean that it doesnt have outstanding passages  the parts about hermiones crush on lockhart and harrys visit to the burrow and the car im quietly in awe with the authors muse cos is a book full of adventure carefree thrills and no padding in it i am luffyp thank you lisa  ok finished book  ive definitely entered potter world i enjoyed it  but i dont think this was as strong as the first book it feels like a transition book  i loved ginny  and harrys relationship developing with her ron and the gang  and their dialogue is wonderful sandwich plates that rebuild themselves  ha only in wizardland   love it  harry potter rereadharry potter rereadalready  is looking awesome  reading with a few other potter heads at buddies books and baubles let the magic commence  me harry potter reread yay squee  hubs seriously you are rereading them havent you read them already and watched all the movies  me yesbut i like to reread them every few years they are magical like that and i want to jump back into that whole world again  hubs blank stare but you already know what happens  me that doesnt mean anything well it does it means that i now have time to overanalyze the whole thing and catch little things i missed the first few times that is the best thing about rereading the hp books  hubs i dont understandyou could just watch the movies it would take less time  me blank stare how did we ever end up together the book is always better than the movie except stardust and the princess bride those i liked the movies more  hubs inconceivable  me there that is how we ended up together  still it is amazing to me to reread these with a group of people and relive all the little things id forgotten along the way i love growing up with harry hermione and ron all over again and going through all those trying times that solidify them as a great trio of friends  chamber of secrets is so well done and i absolutely loved having the why would they ever hire lockheart as a professor welli now know definitively why according to jkr but we had some fun ideas too  for a childrens book i cant stress how well thought out all these are and the magical feeling i get when reading one im almost always sad to realize that im probably a muggle gasps or a squib but either way i dont care ill always try on occasion to cast a spellbecause yes i have a wand and im convinced that one day it will work so i just have to keep trying  wyngardium leviosa favorite of the seriesso many memories i went into this with very very slightly less expectations as i couldnt possibly imagine any other book being as up to par as the sorcerers stone was i wrong  i adored harry and friends adventures just as m
A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,i felt like the last person in the world to have read this book and based on what everyone has said about it over the years i expected this to be the next best thing after the crispy potato soft taco at taco bell but as i read the first  pages i thought everyone was out of their freaking minds this i thought is what everyone has been raving about for as long as i can remember i even did a quick peek at my gr friends list  you people love this book i couldnt figure out why  it started coming together for me somewhere after the page mark things actually started happening and the chapters werent just excuses to explain some sort of mundane aspect of francies life i dont need a lot of melodrama in my literature but there needs to be some sort of conflict some sort of obstacle to overcome some sort of tension this book lacked that for a good portion of the story  when things did get interesting i started to understand why so many people love this book personally i dont love it it didnt make me weep though i admit to tearing up maybe once i think this is another one of those books that i should have read when i was much younger to have a full appreciation for this comingofage novel  i can appreciate it for what it is but it didnt change my life betty smiths classic novel a tree grows in brooklyn is a rather odd book in the sense that it has no real plot there wasnt a buildup to some significant event or events its simply the story of francie nolan growing up in brooklyn new york during the s that about sums it up of course the nolan family goes through their share of hardships francies father has trouble finding work and hes the town drunk but in francies eyes her papa can do no wrong they have a special connection personally i took an instant liking to francie especially in the second chapter when she talks about her love of books and shares with us her special reading spot being a book lover myself and someone who enjoys a little peace and quiet now and then i can relate  did i like this novel it wasnt bad the pace is slowlike a turtle walking backwards slow the plot was rather plain but i enjoyed francie enough to want to finish our journey together i felt a little detached while readinglike how i feel when im sitting around a campfire listening to someone tell a story the old writing rule show dont tell comes to mind i dont know it might just be the authors writing style but i didnt feel pulled into the story as i have with other books sometimes you read a book and youre there with the character but other times youre there there when theyre upset you cry when theyre angry you want to punch a wall i lacked those feelings im not saying dont read it with a goodreads rating of  its obvious others think differently than i do  i suggest a tree grows in brooklyn to readers looking for something light to read i enjoyed it but didnt love it  i read this book the first time when i was thirteen years old suffice it to say that was many decades ago and i remembered pretty much nothing about the book except the vague idea that the young heroine was irish i picked the book up again because my book club chose to read it it had come to a members attention because of its appearance on last years the great american read list of a hundred books that americans love to read we all agreed to read it even those who had read it before  for the most part the book holds up its clearer to me now that the book must have begun as a memoir as the first half is loaded up with background explaining what life was like in williamsburg in brooklyn ny in the early twentieth century at the outset of the novel our heroine francie nolan is eleven years old her mother katie nolan is german irish only through marriage to johnny nolan he is charming and handsome a great singer but alas he drinks too much katie is the main support of the family working as a janitor in three tenement buildings to earn rent and taking in laundry to make a bit extra johnny works when he can as a singing waiter he turns his wages over to his wife for the support of the family but he keeps his tips for drinking money francie also has a younger brother cornelius neely the siblings spend lots of time together especially as katie holds francie back from starting school a year so neely and francie will be in the same grade better able to protect themselves from bullies in school money is always short and life is always a challenge how difficult life is for this family is the main focus of the book yet francie and neely manage to have a decent childhood despite poverty and attitude from outsiders after we are about  through the book author betty smith flashes back and tells the story of how johnny and katie met and married the narrative progresses chronologically forward from that point onward we cheer as katie manages to get her children graduated from eighth grade in turn we bristle as katie forces a very reluctant neely to go on to high school while she forces francie who would love nothing better than to continue her education go out into the workforce  the story is satisfying if somewhat overly familiareven if you havent read it you are not often surprised by how the narrative goes the end of the paperback i read included articles about the author who had a somewhat similar background to francie and managed to get her education and become a writer also included was an article entitled things i want to say about my mother written by one of her daughters smith is portrayed as a true feminist not one to get on a soapbox to make proclamations but one who fought as a divorced woman and a single mother of two young daughters to earn her living some years back one member of our group had taken a short story writing class from that daughter and reported that she felt somewhat neglected as a child as her mother spent almost all her time writingmostly articles and stories smith did remarry in  the same year her first novel a tree grows in brooklyn was published the book was an enormous success as a book and then as a movie it ranked  by readers voting in  for the great american read smith wrote three more novels at least two of them were also made into movies clue the eponymous tree also known as the tree of  or scientific name ailanthus altissima serves as a symbol for hope and perseverance an analogy for thriving despite the odds  here we have a quintessential comingofage story that recognizes all the angst confusion discoveries fears laughter pleasures tears and

slower but stronger romance with clever ben her long night spent caretaking her mothers home birth her successful matriculation as a firstgeneration university student  nevertheless it must be said that it was lacking in conflict pacing and plot a pleasurable read that has undeniable historical significance but doesnt make the lifechanging recommendations list i think this book suffered slightly from ye olde hypemachine so many people rated this  stars and its known to be an american modern classic but for me it just didnt quite reach the dizzying heights that i expected of it  a tree grows in brooklyn charts the life of francie nolan from her young childhood years to her late teens as she grows up in an impoverished family in brooklyn through francies eyes albeit in a thirdperson narrative we see the trials and tribulations of the nolan family dealing with a variety of issues including alcoholism sex and hunger  i do love a good comingofage story and there were many elements to this book that i really enjoyed i liked that the perspective shifted from time to time and that as a reader i was able to go back in time and see how katie and johnny met and their bittersweet lives before francie was born i also enjoyed reading about francies aunt sissy who was a loveable character who dazzled on the page she was so kindhearted and generous you couldnt help but look past her flaws  what didnt quite work for me unfortunately was the writing at first the writing seemed beautiful and it engendered a great deal of excitement for me however i had to put the book down for a while as i was finishing les mis and when i went back to me i just felt that the writing didnt really hit the spot as much as i wanted it to at times i felt that betty smith was telling me what was happening rather than showing me and for this reason i started to become a little tired of the narrative  i think another reason that my enjoyment of the book was lessened a little was because it was so sad at times not in the way that would make me cry mind but just in the kind of empty desolate way where you just cant see any silver linings in the burdening clouds overhead i began hankering after a happier read and i didnt warm to most of the central characters including francie herself enough to be excited about continuing reading  maybe in different reading circumstances i would have enjoyed it more but unfortunately it wasnt the  star read i was expecting however i would still recommend this as i think theres a little something in here for everyone and i would never want to put anyone off something they could potentially love i am eager to watch the film adaptation as i hear it is a great deal more sentimental than the book which would be interesting to see tell the truth write the story  tree grows in brooklyn feels autobiographical and in fact it is betty smith grew up in williamsburg with an alcoholic father and a mother who favored her son she worked at an artificial flower factory and as a press clipper some elements of the story are made up most obviously of course smiths omniscient narrator frequently dips into other characters heads and those bits  frequently as with the sketch of the lonely saloon owner mr mcgarrity among the wisest sections of the book  were surely invented most oddly the fromnowhere incident of the predator shot in the dick by frances mother both feels and probably was made up or anyway transposed from neighborhood legend into frances story but most of it is based on her own life  brooklyns better it hasnt got skyscrapers like new york has it no but theres a feeling about it  oh i cant explain it youve got to live in brooklyn to know  and very specifically based too smith is balzacian in her attention to detail her characters dont just buy an apple they go to a specific real corner like bogart and moore in east williamsburg where they buy something else because an apple costs a dime and you can get a potato for free and here are the other things you can get for a dime its like an instruction manual on how to be poor in brooklyn in the early s this precision is my favorite thing about the book  brooklyn its a magic city and it isnt real  less successful is its sentimentality it veers into corny territory with abandon this is essentially ye old upbythebootstraps story its probably not coincidental that frances father shares a name with a character from a horatio alger book  fine as a novel brilliant as a portrait of a specific place in a specific time after hearing from so many of my friends that this was an endearing wellloved favorite classic im afraid it did not meet my expectations i really enjoyed the first half particularly when the author gives you the back story of the main characters grandparents and parents but the second half felt like a chore to get through at times making me want to  skidoo there are beautiful quotes throughout and i enjoyed the authors way with words but the plot needed more oomph to keep me engaged the most enjoyable components of the novel were the characterization and the literary visit to the turn of the century this book kind of missed the point for me im not sure why its so popular because nothing happens theres no plot or conflict and the characters were all extremely flat  francis nolan is growing up poor in brooklyn saving pennies in a tin can with her mother and brother to one day have a better life watching her grow up was interesting but also incredibly boring because none of it was significant in anyway  so why three stars instead of two or one because i laughed and i even cried at one part i enjoyed the descriptions of brooklyn and betty smiths writing i just didnt enjoy the fact that it felt like a chore to get to the end  i should have dnfd this one but i was so sure something of interest would happen no such luck i enjoyed this book almost in spite of the book if youve never read a tree grows in brooklyn it has quite a bit more language and sexual content than i expected heres a quick breakdown  language jesuss name is used in vain and various other curse words are used throughout its not packed with gratuitous curse words but more than i expected and certainly more than i wanted to be reading  sexual content i was honestly surprised how many references to sex there were in this book despite this book being about a young girl after reading it i would certainly say it was written for adults there is an aunt who is known to sleep around and that causes trouble for the family there is the talk an attempted rape references to perverts and child molesters someone copping feel on the el and a situation where the main character is tempted to sleep with her beau all of these things were mostly talked about discreetly by the characters and seemed to serve the story but typing it all out  yeah thats quite a lot of sexual content although granted not explicit though the attempted rape scene had more details than i wanted what bothered me most about all this was that it was mostly just spoken of as if all this sleeping around or potentially sleeping around is just what is natural and it was only referenced negatively in the context of what it could do to reputations no statements were made about the morality of any of this sexual activity and the main character even regrets not sleeping with her beau its certainly not a book to look to for any good examples in this arena and i personally would certainly not hand it to my teen  other one of the characters leaves a couple of her husbands without divorcing them and then remarries many lies are told by the characters many of them brushed off because they are for the greater good the father is a drunk the characters are mostly catholic with some mysticism thrown in there so many doctrines and practices that are mentioned are not biblically sound praying to mary purgatory etc  wew i think thats it  despite all this negative content i did actually quite enjoy the story the characters with all their many flaws were so well developed and realistic they seemed like real people with parts you loved about them and some things you hated what particularly struck me in this story was francies relationship with her dad  despite his being a drunkard he tried so hard to be a good father and he was always there for francie in a way that her mother couldnt be i couldnt help loving his character if anyone was to be admired in this book i think it was francies mother though for being so strong and faithful despite poverty and a difficult marriage the ending of this book was so satisfying to me and was pretty happy which i always love i am a sucker for coming of age stories and i really thoroughly enjoyed this book  so would i recommend it  as a book to teach good morals  no i would not hold this book up as a support for good moral decisions because i felt any statements on morality were either wrong or completely lacking  but as a book to discuss human nature to spark some deeper thoughts on what makes you you and to meet characters that youll fall in love with yes i think so a picture of early th century poverty in brooklyn i felt the reality of the characters their situations their dialogs were marvelous   on completion my views expressed below remain unchanged having completed the novel i will simply add a few points although i loved this book as a child reading it as an adult gave me less in my opinion this book is written for young adults for this audience it is absolutely perfect and worthy five stars but as an adult reading it i could only give it three the book does a magnificent job of portraying how parents love each of their children differently equally but differently it is a classic bildungs roman covering the topics characteristic of such literature  a book has been written about the author betty smith it is entitled betty smith a life of the author of a tree grows in brooklyn i always felt that the author was speaking of her own experiences al though a book of fictiona tree grows in brooklyn is in fact loosely based on her own life  a while ago i reread to kill a mockingbird this book contrary to a tree grows in brooklyn brought me the same if not more enjoyment on the second reading it is is not written for one particular age group   after  chapters i think the writing is fantastic sometimes it is poignant and i feel sad sometimes a smile comes to my face i also very much enjoy the descriptiveness of the writing the time and place are wonderfully depicted  the stores the neighborhoods a school day daily routines popular songs and food all of these details are interwoven into francies daily life the picture the author draws of her sitting on a fire escape in among the leaves with her cookies and drink  well you feel as if you were there on a hot summer day with a pillow beneath your rump engulfed in hot muggy air with occasionally a slight breeze to cool you in addition francies parents come alive they are good and they are weak and they feel so darn reeal you can love a weak person truely you can  nevertheless i am having some trouble listening to the audio now it takes foreve which kind of annoyses me sometimes the narrator mixes up who is speaking and has the wrong inflexion to her voice i probably wouldnt be so picky if the pace were faster i believe that listening and reading are two very different experiences conversely i do enjoy listening to the songs that are sung  a huge plus for the audio version  i have another problem i feel the book is a lesson on how to be a good person on how to appreciate life even when times are bad i agree with the philosophy stated but i really get a little bit bored being taught this all over again given that i am an adult i find it a bit didactic  as a child i adored this book however now reading it as an adult i doubt i will give it  stars  this was a lovely story about a poor family living and struggling in brooklyn ny right after the turn of the th century francies story was touching and heartfelt at times and at other times frustrating and annoying but overall i did like the story  i really liked the nolans their family didnt have much and they lived hand to mouth daily but they did have each other and even when things went wrong they still were family and loved each other katie was my favorite character she was strong and forthright and determined and she made sure that no matter what came they had food on the table i was glad that she finally got a little bit of contentment and security after all of her years of struggle  i liked francie too but i wish that she had a little more of her mothers straightforwardness too often she meekly agreed and consented and stood by while people decided her life and how she should live it as much as i like ben which is much more than i liked lee it annoyed me that she should allow him to decided where she go to school which classes to take how to get there when to leave etc granted i am an independent woman living in a much much different culture than francie but her mother never let anyone rule her and so i wanted a little more of that to rub off on francie  when her teacher told her that truth is beautiful except if its a truth that is hard to listen to like poverty and hunger i wanted francie to make some scathing reply and defend her family rather than take another bite of humble pie and allow the teacher to make her ashamed of who she is and where she came from francie knew in her heart but she didnt say it and therefore allowed the teacher to continue an ignorant trend of belittling and degrading her students and good people without any knowledge to back up her statements  it seemed to me that there was a lot of emphasis on race here too specifically germans and jews i know that there were a lot of german and jewish immigrants in new york at the time that the story took place and there were a lot of irish as well which is what the nolans were but it seems like there was a greater emphasis on the enmity between the germans and the jews than between any other races depicted i say this because i wonder if the fact that it was written during wwii had any bearing on the story its hard to imagine that it didnt but in every other aspect it seems that smith tried very hard to make things as realistic as possible so i dont want to say that anything was exaggerated either there is quite a lot of mature content in this book and i was surprised at how unsanitized the book is its not filtered or edited to make it more innocent for younger readers its simply this is how it is get used to it  overall this was a lovely comingofage story and was mostly well written there were a few things that stuck out at me however and detracted from the story first smith tended to use i guess this is a free country as a comeback when someone says something and in every situation it just seemed to jar and not fit right i think its the inclusion of i guess that did it  saying this is a free country implies that you know your rights and you can do what you like and crap on other people if they dont like it but saying i guess this is a free country makes it sound uncertain a weak iknowyouarebutwhatami comeback it just stuck out to me like a sore thumb second she tended to tell you what was going to happen as a kind of get ready here it comes segment and then backtracked to set the scene and tell you how it happened this isnt terrible but it tends to take the power out of whatever the revelation is because we dont get a build up or the worry or anything we just know what is going to happen and get to wait for it lastly there were a lot of typographical errors in this edition i dont think that this was smiths fault it was most likely the lazy publisher who put out this edition but the fact that there were so many errors was incredibly distracting  all in all i liked it and would recommend it to people looking for something lightly deep to read francie and her family will definitely make you glad for what you have and that alone is worth its weight in gold  youd think i would have read this when i actually you know lived in brooklyn but no im only now getting around to it i get it its good it has merit its one of those classics you should read at least once in your life but im giving away my copy and ill never go back to it as i followed along i kept imagining the action taking place in the tenement museum which id highly recommend visiting if youre ever in new york and love history and because i do like to read about this time period and i have some familiarity with the setting i enjoyed it on that level it paints a vivid portrait of life in that time in that place for that particular subset of immigrants but i could never sympathize with any characters yes theyre uneducated and i suppose thats the main culprit here but really they all make such stupid decisions and say such dumb things i never felt connected to them a man dies of alcoholism at  years old with a wife and three children depending on him how much does a young healthy man have to drink to knowingly kill himself with alcohol at age  seriously even with no education a man should know better than that another example  in one instance the narrator tells us katie had made up her mind to marry him if he asked her simply because life was incomplete without a man to love her i cant i just cant theres going to be a wall between me and any character who thinks that way this classic comingofage story is about francie her family and their turnofthecentury brooklyn neighborhood lengthy but well told tale betty smith wrote her own review in her book some parts are very good indeed other parts youve gone off page  a tree grows in brooklyn this book has many parts that are worth  stars but it could use a good editor since it drifts so much blubbering on so many small incidents in francies life there are too many parts that are boring or dont fit in if it had a good editor and was more focused i would give  stars if it had a great editor it could probably even make it to  stars it almost reads like an unorganized diary of a girl coming of age it has small stories and glimpses to life that endure a lot of wisdom in them the problem is not with the moments of real joy in it just with the overall product  the book deals with education poverty fatherless children marriages politics death pride and love and many other topics francies grandmother and mother has many great opinions about many of the topics specifically her grandmother figured how important it is to read and she decides that her children and grandchildren will put their energy in being better than the last generation she tells her daughter to read one page a day from two books shakespeare and the bible she also has a plan of how to save money i loved her thoughts on how to improve life for your next generation even though the overall environment is very chauvinistic francies family and especially the women their are more progressed and express great opinions sometime relatively to their neighbors but most even modern and open  i wish someone will edit this book into a better woven version of itself in the meanwhile i am sad to give it just  stars i think that this was another of the audible daily deals that i am quite partial to or at least a sale item which i had probably heard of before but certainly wasnt aware of its classic status in terms of american literature   the book tells the story of francie nolans upbringing in the williamsburg area of brooklyn in the early years of the th century and paints a vivid picture of both the physical environment and of the everyday life that those struggling to make ends meet had to live at the time francies mother katie is a strong character though not flawless in her dealings with her children and johnny her father the alcoholic singing waiter cuts a poignant figure when featured my favourite character was probably sissy katies illiterate eldest sister who brazenly uses her womanly charms with a succession of husbands bigamist in the eyes of the law though not in her eyes due to never having had a church wedding and a strong influence on the family while at the same time trying repeatedly to have a family of her own   why didnt i love the book then i think perhaps because ive read a number of similar books recently dealing with similar experiences both in nyc and elsewherebooks like elena ferrantes my brilliant friend hans falladas iron gustav to a certain extent mary costellos academy street and even chaim potoks the chosenwhich i enjoyed more    the book certainly has its merits but its not one that id be rushing to recommend to all my friends  horses for courses though nothing really happens in this book and yet i couldnt put it down this book is comprised of beautiful descriptions interesting characters witty dialogue thoughtprovoking themes and sociopolitical agendas at times smith is raw and unfiltered in her writing this makes sense because smith drew from her own childhood experiences i cannot recommend this because it is mature and graphic in certain parts this isnt a happy cheerful book for young girls this is a bleak lifeishard book for mature readers though i generally consider myself to be a fan of slowmoving books i must confess that after listening to the first couple disks of this book on cd i felt compelled to look up the plot summary online just to be sure that there would eventually be a plot we had spent so much time with nothing but descriptive writing about a single afternoon in a single neighborhood that i began to wonder if the entire book would be spent giving noth
War and Peace,war and peace was an experience there were times i envisioned myself reaching the end spiking the book like a football and then doing some sort of victory dance around the splayed pages when i got there though i simply sighed leaned back in my chair and thought at least this was better than moby dick  heres the thing that surprised me the most about war  peace its extremely readable its not filled with difficult or outdated language at least in the pv translation it doesnt have long hard to parse sentences the action and dialogue is fairly straightforward the characters become easy to follow if you are freaked out by war  peace because you think its hard its not although you will have to power though the utterly dull and overlypopulated intro party scene gah  however war  peace is filled with endless diversions especially history primers and theological discussions of death and minutia of battles tolstoy goes off on tangents and it can take a while to get back to the story i know some people love those tangents  i didnt tolstoy failed to reel me in and make me care about the logistics of war or his philosophies of physics in the social sciences  one quick note on the pv translation  they left in the original french and german with translations in footnotesendnotes i found their annotation style to be clunky at best in retrospect i would have chosen the briggs translation even though its not available in ebook format  whats sad is that for the first half of the book i read slowly deliberately and researched stuff outside of the book i wanted war  peace to be a rich experience i was reading this with quite a few people in a group and thought i could really appreciate why people call this the great novel evar but after odd pages and  weeks i still wasnt engaged with the characters the story or the history so i started to read faster just to get through it  im not saying its a horrible book though the characters are well defined and they grow and change over the years of war struggle and collective bourgeoisie quite a few people in the group readalong fell in love with some of the major protagonists certainly for me the homefront story was more compelling than any other aspect of the story  heres one way i can tell whether a book is rising above an average read for me do i think about the characters the story or the issues outside of reading the book for war  peace except for our group discussions this was a resounding no discussions of ladies facial hair was the most thrilling aspect  i had a hard time getting war  peace to rise about a meh for me even considering its proper historical literary provenance well ive done it i can finally say that ive conquered this somewhat complex beast that is war and peace ive had it on my toread list for around ten years and now i too can finally be at peace the novel isnt as readable as i expected especially when one compares it to other large novels like les miserables but it was less taxing on the brain than i had imagined it might have something to do with the english translation that i have  this is my second tolstoy novel the first being anna karenina which i just adored tolstoy has a unique writing style that i generally favour you can tell that he was before his time in regards to humanity in the way in which he writes about the characters and their flaws etc this novel taught me history about napoleon that to be honest i wasnt even aware of  there are many scenes set in battle that i thought were just dire they dragged and were really quite dull i get that there are going to be battle scenes as we only need to refer to the title of the book but i noticed that the characters came in second in regards to military strategies and napoleon there are also many philosophical contemplations in this so if you are greatly interested in this kind of thing then this is certainly the book for you unfortunately for me i need something much more to make a story complete and an abundance of philosophical ramblings just didnt cut it  im probably making it sound that there is a total lack of character development here which actually isnt the case pierres character is interesting and so is prince andreys but both were not interesting enough to make the story better for me there were other more significant characters that had more of a role but unfortunately there wasnt enough development to enable them to grow on me i must add at the end of the novel sits the epilogue dont worry about reading it as it adds nothing to the story except a kind of yawn factor  i probably shouldnt be doing so but throughout this novel i was comparing it to victor hugos les miserables they are both hefty in size and are both historical fiction so with this information i assumed that id love war and peace for me les miserables exceeded my expectations and dazzled me from beginning to end even throughout the rather detailed descriptions of the battle of waterloo and the sewerage systemsit is inevitably my favourite book of all time and for me war and peace lives comfortably in its shadow the whole world is split in two for me now one half is her and its all happiness hope and light the other is not her and its all misery and darkness  prince andrey  it is hard to believe that a novel such as war and peace that is usually considered one of the greatest novels ever written has been almost a disappointing reading experience for me overall the book was good however it was by no means a favorite read of mine and not because of tolstoys writing stylea prose that is really impressive fascinating to say the leastbut because of the story that didnt live up to my expectations at all even henry james one of my favorite authors said in his preface to the tragic muse that peace and war now i can see why he decided to change the order of the title in my opinion  war  peace is a loose baggy monster with queer elements of the accidental and the arbitrary and where he wonders what this piece of work means artistically speaking perhaps i disagree with jamesman you cant call a novel loose and baggy when you actually wrote one the golden bowl that is not necessarily an understandable and tothepoint story lets be honest here yet it is still an alltime favorite of minebut i agree on the fact that war and peace is really a monster a big monster that comes from a terrifying dream and a story that feels like clothes scattered on the floor  lets be honest again it has been a while since i read a book where i couldnt care less for its characters writing my thoughts here i realize that i couldnt feel empathy or sympathy for them or at least for most of them though there were two characters who were somewhat important for me eventually these characters disappeared from the story and consequently i lost interest in what could happen after such events dont get me wrong i do believe both characters development and plot are really well written and depicted and even i found myself enjoying the story at the beginning but at some point i just wanted to finish the book and move on to a new story when i said the story feels like clothes scattered on the floor i really meant it sorry but i cant help remembering the great amount of plots and subplots that this novel has and where everything feels really untidy so to speak for instance when i was enjoying the story between character a and character b suddenly a new story came and now we had to focus on character c andor character d for a long time then character e andor character f and so on and so forth this kind of novel where we dont know anything about the story of one character for a long period of time since there are a lot really a lot of chapters in between concerning other characters or nonfiction stuff was definitely not for me especially when it comes to characters who i dont care about unlikefor instancemoby dick a novel that i thoroughly enjoyed reading moreover there are some subplots that never had a proper ending it was as though the author had forgotten to finish those stories which was rather disappointing notwithstanding my disinterest in them  even though my experience was far from being the best i found the prose really captivating and genuinely beautiful easy to read and very understandable as everything i have read by tolstoy thus far also i read a review recently where someone said war and peace is like a soap opera with a lot of gossipy entertaining stories inside and certainly it is i would agree on that unfortunately that wasnt enough for me now i must confess that at times i found the narrative rather repetitive and boring boring because of tolstoys thoughts being repetitive it was a constant repetition of nonfiction statements about history politics the napoleonic wars etc and honestly i never understood the purpose of it the purpose of being so repetitive for instance when i was reading the epilogues the first one seemed to be fine albeit its different tone and pace with respect to the rest of the book but the second epilogue holy cow i literally couldnt finish reading it again the author is rambling on the same topics as if his life depended on it he just keeps going on and on and without saying anything else i didnt care about it either and since a friend of mine told me it wasnt necessary to read it i just gave up before finishing chapter  hopefully nobody is going to judge me for skimming those first chapters and for skipping the last ones  unlike les miserables by victor hugo a book that i dont plan to read ever again i believe i need to pick up war and peace in the future probably in  years or more and to see if my thoughts on it can change perhaps the fact that i spent a lot of time reading it as well as the great amount of characters made me have such an experience i am nevertheless very optimistic about a second read where my expectations wont be too high additionally id like to point out that the translation was by no means a problem here it actually made me enjoy both the prose and some plots speaking of which i chose to read the anthony briggs translation for one only reason there are no passages in french in the entire edition since i dont speak frenchi dont even know how to say good morning in french despite the fact that one of my best friends is from lyoni wasnt into reading an edition where some parts of the text and mainly the dialogue were in french along with the same text in english as footnotes going back and forth every now and then while i read it so the best translation i could find was definitely the anthony briggs in my view it was a good translation straightforward yet poetic at timesperhaps this is just tolstoys style of writing after allalthough it felt kind of modern and when it comes to nineteenth century novels i prefer a nottoomodern translation basically as if i were reading the original text that being said id highly recommend this translation since it made me keep reading the novel until the end despite it all finally i also listened to the audiobook with the same translation at the endmainly volume  and epiloguesbut in this case i wouldnt recommend it not only did i have to pay  dollars for it but also i found a really bad edition in terms of the narration sometimes for instance the narrator repeated the same passage twice and other times his voice was so low i could scarcely hear what he was saying honestly i have done better audiobooks on librivox for free on the other hand since i only had the opportunity to do the last fifteen hours probably the first volumes are okaythere are about five narrators for the whole novelthough i cant put my finger on it at the end of the day if there were some flaws in the last part there might be similar flaws throughout the whole thing in short its not worth the money  i know this review turned out to be a personal opinion rather than an objective one but it is what it is i just wanted to say nothing but the truth the whole truth based on my own experience all in all war and peace was not what i had in mind however i promise i would give myself a second chance to read the book again in the distant future i could try a different translation too who knows  hopefully my experience will be much better the next time she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her  approximately from the start of book three middle of the whole war and peace onwards the focus massively shifts to military strategy and the specifics of the napoleonic campaign and those parts were really difficult to get through i missed the main characters and wasnt interested but the first half is inexpressibly beautiful its taken seven weeks but finally im done  ive got such mixed feelings over this book its been  hours of reading its been frustrating exciting a snooze fest an uphill struggle a downhill cartwheel  half way through i has a fully negative review in my head now at the end im back tracking  theres no way the amount of words justifies the action in this book for me it could have been condensed down to  pages easily and if it was  pages id give this more stars as actually the story line is ok not amazing not edge of your seat but its ok  i read the translation by the maude sisters who knew tolstoy personally this translation was done in  there are more recent translations out there which i believe have less footnotes if your planning to tackle this beast my best advice is find the right translation for you and keeping plodding volumes three and four are much easier to digest  my favourite character was the blue  grey dog who doesnt appear much but hes definitely the most active the most lively gave me the best vibe  massive thanks to the gang who read this along side me and encouraged all the way jo tasha chafic zain abeer priya salema ahmed meera and ashok its hasnt been fun but i was sure glad of the company  and now to enjoy reading again  by finishing war and peace one of my dreams came true and that was reading one of the greatest masterpieces of literary classics however i couldnt appreciate it very much the starting was quite fascinating a complete page turner it was so attractive that i felt i was in a marathon but at the end my pace decreased like a turtle i liked the battle scenes and i think i have learned a lot about battles strategies and tactics its thoroughly a historical novel and clearly tolstoy put much time and effort in writing there are more than  characters in the book and almost  of them are real historical figures but i think that tolstoy is a great story teller and not a great thinker of even his own time i like that sometimes classics authors come out of their fictional world and begin an analytical section and investigate the social political or philosophical problems of their era something that tolstoy did in war and peace epilogue which tolstoy said that he was inspired by schopenhauer the idea of whether or not historical events were occurred based on decisions of one person for instance napoleon or the collective will of the people or whether the events were based on free will or determinist for a massive novel was rather frustrating and also obsolete and personally it didnt interest me at all as i am a fan of existentialist authors who believe in humans free will another thing that bothered me is about the female characters natasha tolstoys favorite kind of conventional woman even after getting married and being a mother is not a matured woman who can have enough independency in her live and princess maria is a very ugly girl that i cannot understand why necessarily tolstoy should have created such character as i see that characters personality and many other things in war and peace are not black or white something in between maybe we can call it gray but for beauty beauty of woman there is no flexibility in contrast helene is a woman that any reader would hate her and now that i have finished the novel i realize that tolstoy did not develop helenes character enough and he just wanted to show at one glance perhaps that he hated such kind of women and although he here and there tried to show helenes lack of wisdom in life but her character and her social position says something different however i have no problem to see any kind of character in a novel but i felt that tolstoy was trying to convince forcibly the reader that his opinions are the only correct ideas so that it was difficult for me not to imagining tolstoy as price bolkonsky for the third reason i found war and peace a novel in honor of tolstoys dear country russia and also sacred city of moscow so that sometimes i felt that the descriptions of the historical events converted into a hate speech against napoleon and french soldiers which i didnt expect that my favorite character in war and peace is dolokhov a marginal character that i believe it could be elaborated by dostoyevsky in one exciting and unforgettable novel it took me a while to decide my overall feelings towards war and peace unfortunately part two of the epilogue really put a damper on what i took away from the novel which led to my final rating of  stars whilst i was reading wap i was incredibly proud of myself for tackling not just a classic translated work or massive tome but all three at once i was really impressed with tolstoys grasp on human psychology and the little moments and thoughts that greatly influence people but now having finished i enjoyed the journey much more than the destination now having finished im not sure i can recommend more people read wap in the weeks that have followed since finishing the characters have faded from my mind much more quickly than i had expected much more quickly than they should have considering how much time i spent with them in my life and over the course of theirs so three stars perhaps one day i will reread this behemoth and come to appreciate an ending that otherwise really irritated me this novel is clearly a masterpiece superior to any other russian novel a masterpiece that devoid of social criticism and enthusiastic about the idea of national unity shows its characters as cruel and rude mentally stoned morally depraved and stagnant in a word its realistic  one of the first complete articles on the novel was that of pavel annenkov published in issue  of  of vstnik evropy messenger of europe the critic praised tolstoys masterful depiction of a man in war marveling at the complexity of the entire composition organically fusing historical facts and fiction the dazzling side of the novel according to annenkov was the natural simplicity with which the author transports worldly affairs and great social events to the level of a character who witnesses them in the end the critic called the novel the whole era of russian fiction i would best describe my experience with war and peace as beauty and boredom  it wasnt until  that i started to become interested in any of the characters characters in books either become your friends or they dont i was team pierre the whole way if it wasnt for him im not entirely sure i would have finished  this is the longestbiggest book ive ever read it could have been said in less pages but its not it was a goal of mine to read something that would make me slow down take my time and appreciate the details i used to loathe slow monotonous stories but after battling chronic lyme disease and a pandemic this is the life and pace ive come to appreciate daily this book reflects the battlefield i am currently on in a very similar fashion ambitious and sprawling simple yet somehow not unpretentious an immensely readable account of the intricate workings of the human psyche no doubt yet so so susceptible to collapse under its own scope rife with moments of unpardonable dullness throughout the second epilogue was a big yikes for me as though written solely to cement my thoughts of this being quite shockingly selfindulgent and pedantic  that said i look forward to anna karenina and more of leos work just as the vast territory of russia defeated napoleon tolstoy wanted to use this vast book to defeat the spiritual legacy of napoleon which is the excessive human ambition of russian men at the expense of other people at the expense of spiritualmoral values you can see how aggressive tolstoy is to defeat the little napoleon in his contemporaries and at the end of this book i feel defeated i dont mean that this book is not good it is a great but i feel that it is way too intended to be an example of great writing binary oppositions and similes and lifechanging revelations are countless and after a few hundred pages i started to get tired of them the characters psychological developments were presented so clearly and every character seems to be struggling with only one primary contradiction which makes them a bit unrealistic i have often heard the rather clich statement that tolstoy portrays normal psychology while dostoyevsky portrays abnormal psychology and after reading war and peace i think this suggestion holds true to some extent but actually the normality in tolstoys work rather makes it unrealistic while the abnormality in dostoyevsky rather makes it more relatable war  peace is the book the ultimate internationally praised classic of literature that everyone pretends has read or has been planning to read for years following a few timid tries i finally conquered it and it makes me feel both very brave and exhausted  there are two distinct parts in this book a realistic story of five russian aristocratic families impacted by napoleons invasion of russia and a compilation of essays on the nature of power historiography and how humans relate to war  some editions compile all the essays in one appendix at the end instead of having them intertwined in the story which i would have preferred because it was clearly hard to get through sometimes i do believe that i need to mature a little bit more to fully enjoy this aspect of tolstoy so i plan on going back to war  peace after some time  the realism of the characters all their flaws and nuances is what makes this book brilliant no less is expected after anna karenina but it is really impressive how much life can tolstoy gives to his cast of protagonists no matter the number and the complexity of them i started over quite a few times at the beginning because i could not remember some names but i soon discovered that everything comes into place as you keep immersing yourself in the story  the lines between fiction and history are often blurred as some real personalities of the era appear between the fictional characters the research that tolstoy went under to make his masterpiece as realistic as possible is undeniably colossal  no one has better put into words how i feel about the story in war and peace than roy lotz who has written one of the best reviews i have ever seen on my short time on goodreads i dont believe i could put this concept into better words roy kindly agreed to let me quote this part from his review  no character accomplishes anything heroic or superhuman instead of the protagonist with dreams of glory rushing into battle and slaying dozens of enemies in this book the protagonist rushes into battle only to get a mild wound and run away confused instead of the protagonist searching for the ultimate meaning of life and having a grand epiphany in this book the protagonist searches for the ultimate meaning of life continually fails and ultimately gives up instead of the protagonist falling into love forever and ever in this book the protagonist has faint and irresolute romantic feelings and merely does the best he can such is life and such is war and peace  the good google tells us that tolstoy was an aristocratic intellectual he had all the resources required for providing an authentic narrative of napoleons invasion of russia this baby was christened war and peace presumably in the orthodox tradition the novel ends almost a decade before the authors birth this period was massively important in russian history and was therefore pivotal in shaping the people who came after it this theme pervades the book and tolstoy did a great job of illustrating it for readers of the time im sure this knowledge enhanced my enjoyment it felt supremely authentic  the bad its more historical than fiction by which i mean the authenticity of the story always overshadows how entertaining it is there is also constant preaching  tolstoys political and philosophical ideas get their regularly scheduled ad breaks  and this detached judgemental voice sometimes creeps into the interpersonal scenes i felt it pulled me out of the story  friends character the protagonist is most like there are dozens of characters and several protagonists in this weighty tome natalie starts out like joey and ends up like monica nicholas starts out like joey and ends up like rachel pierre starts out like joey and ends up more like joey finally i finished it i should get a medal for this  all jokes aside the book was okish i know i shouldnt say that about a classic but still it could be half as long if tolstoy kept his history lessons for himself i dont really know what his aim was with this book it is partly a very lovely novel and partly a very dry bordering on scientific history book the second  epilogue was even more a semiscientific study about how history is written what role a person has in history and about that persons free will tolstoy had quite some ideas on this subject but i wasnt expecting this when i started the book the fictional characters were great though i loved pierre and his struggles also prince andrew mary and natasha were beautifully written im taking leave of them now they were my companions for a couple of months but i am glad i can wave them goodbye so ive slam dunked war and peace and now the bragging rights are mine  even so just how much do i want to linger over this dead corpse tolstoys challenge to all those who rather than climb mountains would subject themselves to the masochistic comeon presented by the daunting daring formidable teasing charms of an overwritten repetitive  to pluspage fictionalized historical opus  not much really  but some thoughts do bear being made  after some background  just a hair over three weeks ago i decided to read the louise and aylmer maude translation which appears to be the most common english translation in circulation there is good reason for this in doing a sidebyside comparison of translations at the library i noticed the maude translation was pretty easy to readno small consideration in trying to avoid fatigue over such a long haul  i actually checked out two different editions of the same translation with the idea that i would lug the smallerdimensioned edition in my backpack for bus reading and leave the larger sized edition with larger print at home for evening reading in a comfy chair or at table or desk  for home reading i checked out the  simon and schuster inner sanctum edition which has a nice key to the characters in the back and good footnotes and maps it was one hefty page tome  for bus reading i checked out the two volumes of the  heritage press edition the exact same maude translation which constituted two smallersized books each  pages the page count was actually higher when these two plump volumes were added up more than  pages due to smaller page sizes but each of these two volumes weighed half as much and took up less space in my evercramped backback  this system worked pretty well except that i ended up preferring to read the plus page smaller books whether on the bus or at home because the font seemed friendlier despite the smaller font size and the pageturning time was a lot faster on some days i found it easy to notch a hundred pages with these nifty little volumes so did i read  pages or  pages both the word count was the same regardless of edition  but apart from this analretentive digressive minutiae is whats inside the book worth reading  yes with caveats  in general i felt that tolstoy was a much better writer about peace than he was about war ive never read a better account of the domestic manners and frivolities of pampered euro elites of the th and th centuries one is really drawn into that world it is in these accounts where leo tolstoy shines  i took me about a week to get just to the first quarter mark of the book mainly due to trying to keep the myriad characters and their relationships straight this does get easier as the time and pages fly by but an initial study of the cast of characters and the basic plotline over at wikipedia would be advisable to anyone considering setting out on this journey  by the onequarter mark we encounter the battle of austerlitz a fiasco for russia and its allies and it there that two major characters have had their first trials by fire it is there too where one encounters what to me are weaknesses in tolstoys storytelling  tolstoys way with conveying the action of war is very confusing though part of this may be intentional and in tune with the authors philosophy about how historical events occur the historical motives that drive wars and other mass human movements cant be known or easily explained in ways that historians try to explain them something that tolstoy tells us over and over againand tiresomely so i must add  war is confusing to those on the ground and it is from these perspectives that tolstoy conveys it and that is cool enough if the author had just left it at that but no he finds it necessary to expound through repeated analogy and slight rewordings of the same arguments over and over that history is not driven by wills or plans but by chaos of innumerable factors in one analogy he equates human activity to a bee hive but does so in two long pages in which he restates the same arguments  this tendency is most egregious in the last of the two epiloguesan incredibly anticlimatic lecture in which tolstoy expounds dryly and academically on issues such as free will and the nature of power etc after indulging this longwinded epic for  pages is it really reasonable to expect a reader to endure these dullish ramblings  especially as most of these issues were already addressed in the main text of the story  so war and peace is a dead book that is full of life  pages of turbulence and unsettled lives or settled lives being unsettled and of stultifying ritual and denied desires and delayed gratification until finally around page  the characters who have managed to survive do end up living happily ever after whew that was a relief  and what about the characters it seemed to me that most of the older characters are better defined than the younger ones maybe that is because the older ones have accepted their station in society and are more easily defined by those expectations they are easier to define because they are willing to be typecast by social expectation many of the younger characters natasha pierre nicholas and andrew i found to be shallow even though these are supposed to be the seekers of the story maybe their shallowness is a function of their personal incompleteness their own unsettled sense of personal identity or maybe tolstoy is not as great as filling out character personalities as we modern readers would like or expect tolstoy is great at telling us what his characters look like how they act how they appear to other characters and even what they are thinking and yet often i feel like i really never get to know them so what is missing  and how well does this story sustain itself over its enormous canvas variably id say there are times when the story seems to be headed toward inertia though theres always something that picks things up still honestly this story could have been told in far fewer pagesin half and dare i say it maybe even threequarters less the space but that would of course rob us of the subtleties of tolstoys phrasings and descriptions sometimes a good and sometimes a not so good thing  i have mixed feelings about the book it is not a personal favorite and were i asked if someone should read any six modern library top  picks of  pages each or this book i would say go for the other six books  but i did learn a lot about european aristocracy about lifestyles of the past about philosophical and theological concerns which are still pondered today about the historical forces and alliances in play during the napoleonic wars etc and now im not afraid to take on sergei bondarchuks hour soviet film epic version from  that should be a breeze by comparison its on request at the public library more to come on that  and to my relief the book moved along well enough i found myself blazing through most
"The Little House Collection (Little House, #1-9)",like so many people i read and loved these books as a girl when my son was an infant and i was looking for something to entertain me during his marathon bouts of nursing i decided to read the series again i still found it immensely enjoyable but with one striking difference when i was a child pa ingalls seemed like the coolest dad on the planet  he played the fiddle made his own bullets and took his family on all sorts of adventures all over the unsettled west as an adult however i thought pa came off like a flakey dreamer who put his family through years of hell always claiming caroline if you just put up with backbreaking labor mortal danger and starving kids for a few years just watch this expanse of desertmarshfrozen tundra will become the breadbasket of the world and make us rich as kings how ma ingalls put up with his crazy schemes for so long is a testament t her patienceholy doormatness on rereading i thought the series must be missing the volumes little house on the san andreas fault on the slopes of angry volcano and by the toxic tidepools of threemile island ok so im a little generous with the whole little house series sue me but for me as a child they were amazing and heres why  when i was in first grade in a tiny tiny town in arkansas and hating school with the heat of a thousand suns each member of the class was given identical packages at christmas time they were books id been reading for a long time already so loved a new bookbut disappointment set in as my classmates who got their books first opened them before i had a chance to open mine and they were all the same a beginner childrens book called the big snow i think it was about a kid getting dressed to go out into the snow on one page he put on his pants on the next page his boots and so on and so on for an entire book i wanted to cry  and then when i opened my book it was little house in the big woods then i did cry because it was a real book and somebody got me and knew i was different and it was ok   i loved the series as a kid and after reading each book would spend lots of time imagining that i had brought laura from her time to mine and what it would be like to show her things like cars and telephones and televisionsshed be amazed and shed think i was so cool  yup i just reviewed a book as a yearold youre welcome i read these as a young girl and loved them thats about all i remembered about them though so i decided to read them again and im so glad i did  reasons i loved these books   they are clean and wholesome  they teach responsibility and hard work  they teach about gratitude and being happy with what you have instead of looking elsewhere for happiness  family is emphasized and taught to be an important part of society lauras family is warm loving and kind  after reading about all of the work that went into obtaining honey cheese eggs grain meat oats and butter im grateful that i can make a quick trip to the grocery store and spend my time doing other things  i enjoyed every character in this series i especially loved laura and grew to admire her throughout the series she always wanted to be outside enjoying nature she wasnt big on sitting around for any extended amount of time she was strongwilled and opinionated yet wellmannered and feminine when needed she was a true pioneer and worked hard for everything that she achieved in her life  i also enjoyed the fact that there was a strong father figure in these books who loved his girls and taught them to work for their dreams i was annoyed with the fact that he continued to uproot his family but if he had quit the first time around and everyone else had too then we wouldnt have the good country that we do today  this book isnt politically correct in some places and it gave me a taste of what it was like to live back then im grateful to be living today but there are so many things to be learned from these great people  i better stop now before this gets too long im going to buy all of these books because i will be reading them again and again and again  i read this series when i was in fourth gradeso it was many many years ago however the story has not left my mind i absolutely adored these books and im sure i would love them just as much if i reread them i remembered feeling as though i was with lauras family during every journey they went through its a fascinating story  and a true one at that id recommend that everyone reads this series at least once in their life these books taught me to fall in love with reading not only did these books teach me so much about life in general such as how to make cheese from scratch but they really just expanded my worldview as a child i have a great sense of nostalgia when i think of this series but more than that i feel that laura ingalls wilder had such a gift for storytelling her literary voice is just beautiful the stories were humorous and touching and you always wanted things to turn out for the best for the family and it did in the end classics that will be a wholesome entertaining read for all generationswho doesnt love a realistic glimpse into early americana her phrasing and diction are impeccable yup id read this story as a  year old and love as much as i did when i was an  yr old but perhaps with a deeper understanding i absolutely adored these books as a little girl i just finished revisiting each book in the series and i think i enjoyed them even more as an adult its a wonderful look at american life in the midwest as the first pioneers settled in what was then unknown territory i loved hearing about their adventures as they traveled from one new settlement to another and of all they overcame along the way its nearly impossible not to fall in love with the ingalls family who are each filled with such optimism strength and spirit  of course as an adult some things struck me a bit differently than as a child as much as i still adored pa for his sense of adventure and obvious love of his family i did question some of his decisions as he risked his familys lives moving them to one new location after another the descriptions of the indians also made me cringe a little especially in little house on the prairie i had to remind myself that those were the times that the new settlers feared native americans and native americans feared the new settlers pa does remind his family that the indians are just the same as anyone else and that they only want to be treated fairly and given rights to their land there is also a sense of compassion for them as they are later driven from their territory still it all made me a bit uncomfortable as did some of the stuff on womens rights such as when laura tells almanzo she doesnt feel women should be given the right to vote but again this was the late s things were quite different then  overall this is a wonderful collection of books with a lot to teach about early american life and the importance of family honor values and perseverance these books are a portal to a time in history long gone told through the perspective of a child as she grows and experiences her interesting life i absolutely loved these books growing up and wanted to crawl into the pages and live alongside laura they will forever hold a very special place in my heart  domestic life back in the day might not be quite as cozy or cornucopia as these stories suggest but i worked out my own personal truths about the little house books and why the stories live in my blood its my way of making peace with yet another childhood relic facing the wrath of actuality  truth  christmas is always better in a log cabin on the prairie when you have nothing  remember mr edwards crossing the wild creek to bring the christmas presents from santa claus remember the new tin cup the stick of peppermint candy a heartshaped cake remember ma asking them if their stockings were empty  then they put their hands down inside them to make sure and in the very toe of each stocking was a shining bright new penny they had never even thought of such a thing as having a penny think of having a whole penny for your very own think of having a cup and a cake and a stick of candy and a penny there never had been such a christmas  lets face it if youre ecstatic about receiving a penny albeit a shiny penny you live in an entirely different universe than the one today with expectant kids opening smart phones xbox machines and six hundred piece lego sets christmas on the frontier lacked frantic materialism laura understood at a very basic level the difference between nothing and something between molasses and white sugar between poverty and a penny  in each book christmas is always a monumental event usually with its own chapter that never fails to create a sort of pithy yearning in the modern reader the chapter usually includes such details as pa whittling flowers and birds into a wood bracket for ma laura receiving charlotte her first rag doll the aforementioned pennies the boasts showing up on christmas eve at silver lake the secret makings of mittens neckties aprons and handkerchiefs knitted of thin lawn the youths companions saved to read on christmas day cans of oysters which apparently were quite a treat popped kernels almanzo coming from minnesota with oranges and my favorite the christmas tree at the church with the little fur cape and muff saved for laura the very fur cape and muff that upstage the infamous nellie oleson  oh to be content with a penny of your very own to have a moment fully realized to yearn for nothing else for sheer joy to wash down to your bones to be content with a one room cabin pamade furniture and white sugar only when company came to find your true gifts in the natural world the rippling grass and enormous sky the plum thickets and cattle paths the sheet of silver water and tall wild grass of silver lake the tangles of wild grapevines and wind blowing through the cottonwoods gifts savored with appetites void of distractions without the clutter of too many presents under the tree  truth  dont believe everything you read about pa  i love pa i might have even been in love with him at some point with his wild hair and fiddle playing and his wheres my little halfpint of sweet cider half drunk up seriously pa could do anything build a log cabin fashion furniture from trees dig a well construct a fish trap with scraps of wood twist hay into sticks for burning follow the clothesline to the stable to feed the livestock during a blizzard cross a roaring creek outsmart a pack of wolves survive for three days in a snow bank during a blizzard play the fiddle like a choke cherry tree quivering in the wind melt lead to make bullets kill animals to feed his family build the rocking chair of all rocking chairs for ma win the town spelling bee trap and skin animals plow a wheat field plow a corn field save the house from a prairie fire  however on the internet there are certain innuendos about pa quite a few bloggers attribute the familys several moves and financial loses as proof that pa was either a goodfornothing lazybones or an opportunist charlatan  so in reality pa ends up being rather a jerk one blogger opined  be still my heart if pa wasnt a decent hardworking guy wouldnt the entire premise of the stories falls apart  in the books there is always a really good reason for the moving ons and starting overs and laura certainly didnt seem to mind them since she personified wanderlust in the big woods the land was settling up and food was becoming scarce no more bears and deer meat to survive those long winter months the indians and the government drove them from the little house on the prairie and surely pa couldnt be held responsible for the plague of grasshoppers that devoured his wheat crop on the very eve of harvest while they lived on the banks of plum creek later the long winter stalled their homestead progress and blackbirds ate the corn  in reality there might be some truth in the assertion of pas opportunistic tendencies apparently he knew the land in kansas wasnt cleared to be settled yet theres also the part between plum creek and silver lake when laura and mary worked in a hotel in burr oak iowa and boarded with other people i cant imagine pa and ma paying rent and not living in spaces as wide and vast as a prairie with this knowledge i thought it rather interesting when i reread the following in the first chapter of little town pa has just asked laura if shed like to work in town to which ma exclaims no charles i wont have laura working out in a hotel among all kinds of strangers  who said such a thing pa demanded no girl of oursll do that not while im alive and kicking  but apparently two girls of his did do exactly that while he was alive and kicking  so pa was a complicated man and maybe not as idyllic as the books suggest still laura chose to portray pa as hardworking witty brave largerthanlife maybe hes the pa laura wanted or believed or remembered im sure in actuality charles ingalls was somewhere in between the goodfornothing bloke and mighty paul bunyon its a bit reassuring that he might not have been king of the castle in everyway he did dwindle down to skin and bones during the long winter and could be found cursing the wind and snow ive made my own peace in the realization that it doesnt matter to me if the real charles ingalls was this way or that way i have pa from the books and that is the way i choose to remember him even if fictional pa fulfilled a vital purpose in my young life he personified the kind fierce father the protector of little girls he took them to abandoned indian camps and carried deserted beads home in his handkerchief he knew the answers to vital questions such as how a panther sounds when it screams and why laura wanted that indian papoose with the black eyes and pa was brave remember when he hit a bear over the head with a club because he didnt have his gun true the bear ended up being a tree stump that pa mistook as a bear in the darkening woods but it takes the same amount of courage to attack a tree you honestly believe is a bear as it takes to attack a real bear  truth  i was born in the wrong era  yep i mean it im sticking to it the little house books have always created a sense of longing in me and countless other little girls to live in a log house and even as an adult i still wonder if ive been cheated by being born into this technocrazy world sure life was hard back then and the thought of an unheated house baths only once a week and untreatable malaria hardly sounds like a vacation still they had roasted pigs tail and country dances and buggyrides  despite the abundant amount of information at our fingertips today there seems a lack of critical thinking a lack of wisdom no one i know including myself can divide sums without a calculator or recite from memory the entire american history like laura did at the school exhibition  in actuality im sure the ingalls found plenty of tedious moments for instance we never hear about the outhouse situation in the little books wouldnt that have caused some serious headache during one of those three day blizzards and how much of their life was spent fetching water kneading dough washing dishes sewing even stitches on a bodice most of their time and energy was spent on providing shelter warmth food and clothing but for me this singlemindedness is the appeal there is no therapy like work they didnt have time to wonder how their parents ruined their childhood or if they should vaccinate their children or if the food they ate caused cancer although ma did believe watermelon caused fevernague pa ate an entire one by himself anyway mostly they were grateful for food even if it was blackbird pie  out on the prairie or in the little town strangers aided each other in times of illness or distress people needed each other for survival i wonder if their perspective focused more on the eternal because death lurked in the corner although id never say their lives were easier or even simpler i do believe the reality of their situation forced them to face the bigger questions more often they dug to the roots of life more often because they had fewer distractions obscuring their view like overgrown ivy for some reason that sounds mighty appealing to me  truth  a fictional story is no less beneficial and authentic than a true story  i think i came to this conclusion early in life growing up on narnia and nancy drew and beverly cleary then came jane eyre and my name is asher lev and housekeeping all books that expanded and latticed my life with beauty yet in society there is generally greater value placed on a true story than on a fictional one ask james frey a friend once told me she couldnt justify reading fiction because she wasnt learning anything apparently fiction equates a lack of truth in this vein laura and her daughter rose took great pains to assert that every word of the books were true thus creating the controversy when facts proved otherwise  yet stories true or not live in our blood and give meaning to our lives some of the greatest lessons are taught through fiction jesus himself taught eternal truths through parables ive come to the conclusion that it doesnt matter to me whether every word in the little house books reflects reality maybe it was never the true aspect of little house that bewitched me maybe it was the way the books carried me out of the real world and into another real world that just might exist because this laura person really did exist the stories have become a part of me as real as a childhood memory they vibrate in my background like the wind chimes on my front porch the idea of the log cabin made with pas bare hands and mas until she sprained her ankle still tangle up around me like wisteria    with little house i still find some sort of hoary comfort from reading about maple dripping from trees and squash stacked up in the attic the stories are rustic safe the ingalls experienced hard times but the stories seem to unfold and move beneath a safe paraffinlike surface a surface not unlike the glossy pages in the fullcolored collectors set nothing scratching their beauty no matter how many grasshoppers ate the wheat or how many blizzards attacked the house or how many times nellie called mary and laura country girls ma was always home cooking her baked beans and no yeast bread and pas gun hung over the doorway on two wooden pegs  oh to play catch with a pigs bladder to wear a brown poplin to church and have a cat climb up your hoops or slide on the ice of silver lake and escape the wolves to sleep in a hay ticked bed to be thrilled with syrup squiggles in the snow or to wade in a creek with the waterbugs to draw a dripping bucket of cold fresh water from the well to look through an open window at a pack of wolves to slide down a golden strawstack or gallop across the land clutching handfuls of a ponys mane to hear the horse bells in the frigid air coming to take you away from the horrid mrs brewsters for the weekend i actually read these books at the interesting age of   i was completely obsessed with laura and mary for some reason i liked to relate myself to mary but then she went blind after getting scarlet fever and it kinda ruined it for me if im being honest typical mary eyeroll  i loved them so much that i literally dressed up as laura for world book day and i wore a bonnet and pinny with a floor length gown i was dedicated  when the dog died a large part of me died with it same with the cat who was mentioned a couple times and they just left it behind in their stupid cabin in the woods  also mary and laura do be girlbosses for walking  miles to school everyday  but yes between the ages of  i probably would have given an arm and a leg for this book series loved each book in the collectionthese books helped fuel my love of reading and interest in history they made the past real to me i began reading this series in the th grade and i think read the last one during my th grade or the summer before i loved back then to read all kinds of stuff but books about history or rural settings just spoke to me i think even then i was destined to be forever in love with history i loved the adventurous nature of pa and ma ingalls products of a time in history when men and women had the pioneering nature that whether right or wrong was the history of the united states they lived in a generation when many grew up hearing the stories of how their fathers or grandfathers crossed the ocean looking for a better life about how brave they were they wanted that same adventure they were being tempted by a government offering free land and hearing everyone say just go west to the promised land  the little house series is about a portion of the history of the united states and how a young girl witnessed it laura ingalls wilder has endeared the ingalls family to many young and old readers alike yes they are simple but even as an adult i still enjoy reading them today i have ever since i was  and received a box set of the little house books adored each and every single one of them in over  years my feelings towards these books havent changed one iota they are easy to read and chock full of information about life as a young pioneer girl how many times did i wish i could taste mas vanity cakes or see marys college dress in person these books are so fascinating for anyone remotely interested in history that it makes it impossible to put them down  the writing itself is fine let us remember that laura ingalls wilder was a teacher in the late s and that she always received top marks in grammar and reading even looking over her books now as persnickety as i am about poor spellinggrammarediting while her language is simplistic there is nothing wrong with the way she writes  these books are meant to be treasured my teacher gave these to me in first grade she was impressed that i had taught myself how to read and i was such a well spoken child at an early age what went wrong with me  well these books are an all time classic i remember staying up all night reading the stories with the blanket over my head and my brothers flashlight shining on the pages they kept me up all night and i so miss the books the movies but even more so the morality that was so simple and logical that it makes me stop wondering what went wrong with me but what went wrong with my country to dispel the fine outstanding morals of this time and place this series was the one that jump started my reading i almost despised reading up until the day when  yearold me picked up the little house in the big woods determined that since my older sister had read them so could no matter how much i knew id dislike it in the first chapter i was already enjoying myself i read one after another of this series and ive loved reading ever since though im still not as fast a reader as my sister ive read through them myself twice since then and also participated in listening most nights when my mom was reading through them to my younger siblings before bed last year i really wish i had read this as a young girl but sadly i was the right age for the tv show then and never considered picking up the books i always thought the show and the books were essentially the same but as an adult i understand how rare that truly ever is anyway i had an opportunity to listen to the series audiobooks and remembered how much i loved the show so i gave it a go i loved the audiobooks the narrator was greathow she sang all those songs still confounds me the romance was so sweetsomething i would have adored as a young readerbut different than the romance portrayed in the tv show i still couldnt help seeing the books through my memories of the tv show the actors are the characters in my minds theres no way to not imagine melissa gilbert and michael landon as the mcs and to this day dean butler still makes me swoon  if nothing else the books confirmed for me that i could never be a pioneer theres no question that ill be one of the first eaten by zombies in the coming apocalypse my mom read these books to me and all my other siblings at least  times and each time i loved hearing each story this series is one of the best when i travel on book tours i prefer home hospitality rather than staying in a hotel hotels are lonely they require me to leave at a specific time and they dont have kitchens stocked with all sorts of tasty snacks the homes i stay at typically put me up in a guest bedroom that previously belonged to a child who has since left the nest often the childs books are still there  on my recent book tour in florida i spent the night in my hosts daughters bedroom where i saw little house on the prairie on the bookshelf i loved laura ingalls wilders semiautobiographical historical novels when i was young so i picked it up started reading and ended up finishing it reading one of my childhood favorites as an adult was so intriguing that i decided to reread the entire little house series amazingly i think they stand up pretty well  years later  however ive recently learned that wilders stories are a lot more fiction than autobiography and that there appears to be a political slant behind them here are a couple of articles for those of you who want to know more from boston globe and slatecom now i cant wait to read pioneer girl the annotated autobiography  by the way lauras older sister mary apparently went blind from viral meningoencephalitis not scarlet fever  when i was a little girl my father used to read me these books it has been a really long time since then and i can hardly remember most of the stories from the book but i still remember the sense of excitement and adventure in these books laura and her family were pioneers and as a young girl she met each move with a sense of adventure and openness to the world i also loved that the girl was called laura like me  these stories are a true testament to the amazing spirit of the pioneers they kept moving on dealing with the problems of their life never losing hope the parents always did their best to make this world pleasant for their children and to make times like christmas magic trips to town were a treat when the girls would get a lolly each they had very little but completely appreciated what they did have something which a lot of us have forgotten in our modern consumer driven society i dont long for those times because the life was hard and not everyone made it as lauras family did but i love the simplicity and teamwork of their little lives it reminds us to appreciate what we do have and anyway they were just such amazing adventures  i think this series is must read material its also great for parents to read with their children creating wonderful memories like the ones i have i used to listen to these books as my mother read them my mother got them as a child they kept their gifts in the attic inside their pillow case my mother snuck up into the attic every night to read her books she had not received yet she loved them and still reads them to her children to this day the books themselves are well put together have pencil drawing and explain a lot about the early american heading south laura is wonderful at describing the suroundings as she moves through the states her sister became blind and she described the world to her her sister became independent and went to a school for the blind she was even able to ride horses to her home on her own even after laura grew up she tells her life all the way through until the point that she got a treasure paper her daughter also grew on her mothers passion for writing and started writing books also of her childhood i was able to go too a museum of lauras life was spent we did activities like making butter i was able to learn the skills of the early settelers and make things like maple syrup i think that every child should get a chance to learn from laura  my husband found this collection in a used book store and bought it for me as a christmas gift he knew how much i loved these books and that i had this same collection as a child my mom gave me this same set when i was  or  i tore through all of them at record speed and loved them as much as ever the day to day life of the ingalls family their struggles and triumphs brought me back to being a little girl in love with these books the saddest part however was that aside from the first book little house in the big woods none of them had been read as a girl i read the entire set into shreds cracked spines pages falling out then gone missing the girl who owned this set britney fonteyn who was proud enough to scrawl her name across the top of the cardboard bookcase they came in never came to know the rich colorful and sweet stories it held within i finished this serial a long time ago when i was in the elementary school  back then i didnt really care if the plot or writings were good or not i do remember the translation were bit confusing  this is part of my childhood a very personal one for me laura ingalls accompanied me through some hard times and good times when i was a kid like a friend that i ran to to when i needed to hide from the world  i hated nellie oleson with her grieved when they lost their baby brother trapped in the snow with them tearful when mary lost her sight and because i was still a kid back then i didnt really understand the part she fell in love with almanzo wilder  i should thank laura for the beautiful  heartwarming stories and thank you for being my childhood memory i suddenly got a hankering to reread the little house books after moving into my own house that was built around the same time ingallswilder and her family were beginning their travels my adult eyes were able to appreciate much more about the stories ie rich details of pioneer life intermingled with true prejudice against american indians the educator and pedagogue in me also deeply appreciates ingallswilders lived perspectives on what turnofthecentury education was all about each of these books offers something different but i think my favorite is little town on the prairie in which you can literally watch the town of desmet south dakota rise up from the ground this isnt five stars for lauras or roses writing style this isnt five stars for the pageturning bloodpumping excitement here nor for the complex plot as this series has neither of those things this isnt five stars for current popularity this isnt five stars for the impact these books have on my current life this is five stars for a time gone by lauras childhood and mine growing up i didnt just read about laura ingallsi wanted to be her and was her to some degree whenever i reread any of these books i get a funny little nostalgic ache and for that i owe this series every one of those five stars words cannot express how much i love these beautiful books not only are they fun easy to read books with a historical fiction aspect but they have a great personal connection to me my dad would read these to us childrenmy brother and i perched on either arm of the big black chair his leather recliner and my baby sister on his lap he read us the whole series one chapter or two at a time every night ill never forget the my dad reading us the lyrics to the songswhat a wonderful tradition i havent read this series in decades and yet i still remember so much i should do a reread over the summer loved them all then love them now i want to reread them all during this pandemic rereading this series one of my favourite when i was a young girl brought me a tremendous amount of nostalgia and comfort interestingly it also gave me hope reading all the hardships they endured during those times i started to think if they could get through blizzards with no heat and barely any food for months on end grasshopper infestations fires that destroyed their crops and on we can get through this difficult timelike a fellow goodreads friend kim reynolds said  i feel like pa could fix this i love pa also the beautiful illustrations are so well done and brought me back to my childhood when i used to get lost in them whatever your children favourite book was i recommend you read it now it does a world of good stay safe and happy reading i read these books as a teenager they resonated with me then and still do my mom gave me this series they were old well worn books that were given as a gift by her mother lost these treasured books through the unrolling of the years which is a tragedy the age maturity development was expediated during these hard times the lifestyle the culture of these times is fascinating our culture now seens to have the opposite effecton creating
A Clockwork Orange,rebellion can take on many forms and in a clockwork orange it takes on the form of language the spoken word  all societies have their constraints though breaking through them is often difficult what the poor disaffected youth do here is create their own system of communication that is so utterly theirs every word carries history and by destroying such words the youngster are proposing a break from tradition they are proposing something new this idea is captured when they attack the bourgeoisie professor in the opening scene they beat him tear his books apart and strip him naked in the streets it is an act of aggression and power it is an act that is infused with jealousy and rage the lower classes are sick of the elites and the poor are sick of the rich and they want to stand on their own two feet  is it better for a man to have chosen evil than to have good imposed upon him  description  description  however despite the symbolic nature of the scene it also demonstrates the rash nature of such youths in their actions they perpetuate such divisions and class divides they never stop to consider that perhaps the professor could be sympathetic to their cause they just dont care they enjoy violence too much instead they just see and object of power knowledge and wealth so they attempt to destroy it having passion and a strong will are vital for social change but using such things sensibly and at the right time is also of equal importance im not an advocate of violence but they could have used that better and more productively too  society fears them it fears these boys that represent dissatisfaction and anger how far can they go how powerful could they become what will the future hold burgress shows us a speculative future a what if situation that is not implausible the novel is advisory it suggests that something needs to be done to society in order to avoid the pitfall the gang fell into here like all significant literature the work has a universal quality it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in the s because it shows us what unbridled and misguided temper can achieve  alex the gang leader is thrown into jail after committing a particularly nasty crime the doctors then attempt to rehabilitate him through psychological treatment based on schema theory and the rules of conditioning and association afterwards the thought of violence sickens him physically and he is thrown out into a world that hates him and one he can no longer survive him he is completely failed by society but it is near impossible to have sympathy with such a reckless anarchist he is violent and spiteful  a clockwork orange is a postmodern masterpiece because of its experimental style language and allegorical content however it is also an extremely difficult book to read and an even harder one to enjoy the slang frustrated me it was understandable but very dense at times its a clever device but an agenising one i disliked this element for the same reason i will never attempt to read finnegans wake by james joyce i liked to get lost i dont like to have to put effort in when i read perhaps im a lazy reader regardless though it was a huge relief to actually finish im still going to watch the film and i do think i may enjoy it a little more than this ive owned this book for  years and it wasnt even on my to read list which gives an indication of how excited i am to read it  update even anthony burgess doesnt get the appeal of this one hmmm as far as an enjoyable reading experience goes id say this one is the bottom of the barrel its hard to be inside the head of someone who is for no apparent reason just an absolutely evil piece of shit  description  now thats not to say this isnt a worthwhile read however im trying really hard to figure out what the point of this book was and coming up with a blank like was there a moral to this story i dont think so the concept was an interesting one though a young psychopath volunteers to get rehabilitated to reduce his jail sentence never for a moment thinking that it might work and it doesnt not really hes still a terrible person but now when he contemplates anything violent he gets physically ill  description  and the question we are left with is whether or not it would be right to force someone who enjoys raping women and brutalizing the elderly or really anyone weaker than him to undergo a form of torture therapy that would make him unable to commit violent acts in the future im sure there are some people who will disagree with me but i would say the answer to that is a fairly obvious duh if youre not going to kill someone like this outright which i am also fine with then i see no problem with castrating their instincts to hurt other people how is this a problem its not my problem for damn sure  description  does it save their soul doubtful but i dont care about that sort of thing as i feel everyone is responsible for their own soul or lack thereof if there is an afterlife i highly doubt there will be some sort of reckoning or punishment for evildoers after all theyre only acting this way because of past trauma or some sort of chemical imbalance right so if something comes after this it only makes sense that theyll probably get a second chance to be a decent person and now im wandering into some kind of philosophicalreligious territory better left alone  description  in the end the powers that be feel that what theyd done to him wasnt right as he had no free will and eventually wanted to kill himself everyone felt sorry for him and he was allowed to go back into society with his free will reinstated wow  description  this edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the first edition and burgesss introduction a clockwork orange resucked was what mine said apparently the us version was missing a part of the story burgess originally wanted to show that people change as they get older and that our young heathen is no different you see in the final chapter that he doesnt find rape and murder as much fun as he used to and is now contemplating settling down with a nice girl and staying in on friday nights oh um what if were supposed to take that literally it just makes zero sense most of us got into a bit of mischief when we were teenagers but i can honestly say that i never found attacking people for the hell of it part of my good times and i dont think most people do something is desperately wrong with you if thats the way you spend your saturday afternoon and getting older isnt magically going to fix it now if this is simply a metaphor for growing up growing older and becoming more responsible its maybe the worst one ive ever heard  description  this was a weirdass book and im not sure it was actually very good theres no real plot as youre just following along for a fairly graphic ride of torture rape and brutalization that ends with a very weak conclusion the fact that you need to learn an entirely new set of slang to translate this book is only a small annoyance in the grand scheme of things but it was still an epic irritation to me while i was listening to it on the flip side i can see why this is such a cult classic theres a lot of shock value to almost every page that holds up even now the gleeful way he describes drugging and raping the tween girls is something that will stick with me for a while   alex and his gang are the product of a generation where violence is habitual and trivialised for them it is not a question of unease or the sign of a revolt but quite simply of a simple distraction the paradox in the story is that alex is passionate about classical music music meant to soften souls and not lead them to depravity so their favourite pastime is terrorising poor people physical violence verbal violence nothing omitted alex is in a way the guru of his gang since he addresses them by qualifying them as brothers alexs mother ignorant at the beginning of her sons actions eventually surrenders to reality and accepts that a new experience had performed on her son the doctors in charge of practising this therapy on alex will make him listen to classical music the one that is in a way his hymn while forcing him to watch on the big screen the worst images of violence of torture thus they could sensitise him and make him exactly realise what the word violence means the book is a little difficult to access since anthony burgess invented a whole language used by alex and his acolytes but undoubtedly one of the most outstanding of his time just like the film directed by stanley kubrick in  goodness is something chosen when a man cannot choose he ceases to be a man  does god want goodness or the choice of goodness is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him  whats it going to be then eh regular readers of my reviews know that im always on the lookout for that rare situation the movie thats better than the book i keep a running list of them on my profile page but its still less than  movies long but onto that list i now add a clockwork orange a flawed book that was turned by stanley kubrick into a better movie theres no real way to talk about the reasons why without spoilers so if youre trying to avoid spoilers about a yearold novel or a yearold movie please stop reading here  a clockwork orange has a very formal construction the novel is divided into three parts each of which has seven chapters the first part is yearold alex and his mates robbing fighting raping and generally terrorizing the people around them the second part is yearold alex after two years in prison with the middle chapter of that partand thus the entire novelbeing the famous scene where alex begins being conditioned to be incapable of violence and the third part is alex after hes released from prison and trying to reenter polite society  so with that formal construction it is very interesting that the twentyfirst and final chapter of a clockwork orange was not originally published in the united states but after reading the novel i completely agree with that original choice and by extension with stanley kubricks decision to also end the movie with the th chapter the st chapter feels like a cop out with a nowyearold alex feeling that hes outgrowing violence and that hes ready to settle down i mean of course people tend to outgrow violence not a lot of gray hair or walkers in your typical street gang  but the change in alex here feels unearned a false note of forced optimism in a dystopian satire  the comparisons to  are obvious but this book lacks that ones subtlety and complexity at its core a clockwork orange is a morality play with one idea that part of being human is choosing whether to do good things or evil things so an attempt to take that moral choice away from someone by forcing them to be incapable of doing ill strips that person of their humanity alex is a monster but the conditioning done to force him to reject violence is equally monstrous leaving him a pitiable creature who cannot choose to do good because he has no other choices its a solid idea but its depiction here is merely okay for a book about violence so constant and irredeemable that its called ultraviolence the novel is not particularly graphic as if its shying away from the worst bits the moviewith its willingness to show the violence and its ability to actually present the images combined with the classical music as described in the bookis ultimately more chilling and effective combine that fact with the movies wise exclusion of the disappointing final chapter and thats why a clockwork orange is one of those rare situations where the movie is better than the book despite me only giving this book a rating of  stars i completely understand why it is considered a masterpiece the reasoning behind my rating is the writing style  which just so happens to also be the thing that makes this novel so special and unforgettable the fact that the author was able to be consistent with this madeup dialect throughout the entire work seriously needs to be admired for me however it was quite hard to get into the book and stay focused due to the language thats used i got more comfortable the more i read but considering that this is also a rather short book i can say that i had trouble during most of it  the actual topic is amazing i definitely enjoyed the plot and felt connected to the main character alex i think the fact that i was able to get a good idea of what alex was thinking and feeling despite the readingstruggles i experienced speaks volumes it proves that a book doesnt need to be one hundred percent understandable to make an impact a thats why i would recommend to everyone to read this book at least once regardless of my starrating i snuck in to see the film when i was  based purely on the publicity arising from the release of this controversial piece it promised sex and violence a plenty and delivered big style i guess it wouldnt shock a modern audience of teenagers to the same extent but at that time it was really pushing the bounds of acceptability to uk film censors in fact the film was on loop so i actually saw it twice it left a big impression not least of all because of the classical music soundtrack  i still think of the film whenever i hear beethovens th symphony  i read the book shortly after and predictably it wasnt as shocking without the visual imagery but the story of  year old alex yes the same age as me and his droogs friends was still very powerful what i recall most vividly was the need to regularly refer to the language dictionary kindly provided to enable an understanding of the strange vocabulary adopted the violence was still graphic but the moral message the most boring element to me when watching the film was more impactful i was at once understanding of the need to address the violence perpetrated but also horrified by the big brother tactics employed  its difficult to overstate the impact of this bookfilm at the time i can clearly recall many teenagers aping the dress the gang wore in the film and adopting elements of the language i didnt actually witness any evidence of the violent behaviour being copied though there were some reports at the time  for most it was all about aping the the strut and the pose it demonstrated to me the power of cinema and literature in terms of its impacts on culture language and behaviour it also pricked my interest in books and films their ability to excite shock inform disturb and to purely entertain music the soundtrack of the film tw violence rape inclgang and underage home invasion police brutality  in a rather drab world alex and his droogs find entertainment in violence rape and drugs and in alexs case also in classical music a little younger than others he faces betrayal a strange choice and a lot more  i think watching the film maybe some idea of the plot andor knowing about the type of slang this book uses helps one tolerate reading about all the violence and not just alexs gangs and other cruelties in this book released in  this book tells of a future ten years on with an author insert some differences to the film including the last chapter which was not included in american versions before  which also wasnt included in the film  i can see both why it could be seen as not necessary yet also why it is  life develops in strange ways the author was a bit annoyed of it being his most known novel but as one it is a pretty decent one  i wonder if bret easton ellis has read this book  it is a grey dystopian world  even if it doesnt really name the country its set in firmly it feels british  full of revolting youths violence vandalism corrupt and violent police weak government everyone needing to work if not too young sick or pregnant one reason alex is cured of his treatment is because antigovernment intellectual opposition wants to make him an example of it not working alex has already been a while in a correctional school in trouble for some years but is it just a phase of some years or permanent the goverment believes in punishment and doesnt seem to be able to think questions about prevention before it happen are worth a thought  the book is divided into three parts the first most violent in the second part only when alex is repeatedly shown violent film material does things get on the same unbearable level and it does feel such for alex too as his treatment progresses the third part of after apart from what happens to our hero also makes you observes changes in people and the neighborhood  fashion who is gone who is changed who gets revenge on alex who cant defend himself now and only when things get back to normal and comfortable for alex does a developing natural change for alex  adulthood and thoughts about a family of his own and calming down even in music taste start to feel appealing  so much more details and things not on film appear here of course rereading some part will be unappealing but as a whole the book works even at my threestars rating the introduction to my version was good and some themes in the book choice betrayal solutions to violence passivity are worth thinking about this is not a book free of triggers in no way but if one can read it i think its worth it whats it going to be then eh  ive watched a clockwork orange a few time enjoyed it and have had the book on my tbr for years since this year im trying to embrace more classics i thought id finally pick this up it was a decent read but im not going to lie  i struggled  i think the main thing putting me off was the language the book is wrote in first person narrative by alex in nadsat slang its a mix of russian cockney rhyming slang and sometimes even made up words theres no dictionary so the reader has to slog through trying to piece together what alex is saying and at first it feels like gobbledegook but i found as the story progresses i got more use to the terminology and it was easier to deduce what alex is going on about it helped that id seen the movie too as i had a rough outline of where the plot was going yes the violence depicted is awful  but the language used also seems to diffuse the horror of it its as though alex the future narrator version knows the viciousness of his crimes and hes trying to lure you into his world and make it seem less awful by the way he talks  alex is a deplorable character he has no morals no guilt at the actions he takes however hes not alone in acting this way his drooges or followers allow and encourage his behaviour and the various victims that get in their way seem to almost accept their fate as a sign of the youth of today his parents seem scared of him his social worker and school do nothing to change his behaviour even after his time in prison with his choice of actions taken away alex never seems to feel remorse for anyone other than himself he laments only at his lost ability to envoke ultra violence on those he chooses  the last chapter was never included in the american release or indeed in the film i can understand why as it seems to alter the readers overall perception of alex that is built up throughout the novel however i liked the sudden change in tone and feel it gives a more optimistic outlook that people when given the choice can change for the better if they want to because thats what is at the heart of this novel choice and free will i liked this more than i thought i would and appreciated the overall message it was hoping to deliver whats it going to be then eh  ive watched a clockwork orange a few time enjoyed it and have had the

die the guardian  mccaffery barthelme decoders of descendants of rabelais deciders of classics and producers of tv shows all kowtowers to this work one that says even more about the day and age when it is known that the last chapter was cut out of both us books and british movies for being too redeeming leastwise till  rolled around and the editions reverted back to the intended  mark of the age of adulthood here in the states if nowhere else i wouldnt have known that last bit had not my own edition been one of the shortchanged but the last chapter is easily found online these days virulently popular thing that it is  there are books i value more for my resulting recalibration processes than my instinctive appreciation this is one of them but it was like nice to go on knowing one was making the news all the time o my brothers every day there was something about modern youth whats one relationship between comic books and video games one and in my mind the most important one is the common outcry against the two media as propagators of violence in our youth and sundry along with movies and rap music and anything else the generation currently in power didnt have their fill of to the tune of back in my day you dont hear much about the former of course because it has been long ago and long appropriated by the new ringleaders of our sensationalist news and persnickety papers you dont hear anything at all about the military industrial complex and its enormous sway on life livelihood and politics and god forbid the word patriarchy mutters its way across any amplified platform for a gutpunch of feminists and intellectuals and america haters is guaranteed  i dont like violence i can deal it out if needed i can watch it for as long as necessary and its been a long time since the smell of blood and guts phased me in any physical way but i still dont like it i especially dont like violence being excused as the format of a particular message no matter how potent or powerful or prescient its the bread and butter of the patriarchy its a rat race glorified for its seeming eternity in the context of a bell jar its been done to death and will continue to rear its ugly head so long as humanity forgoes empathy for the individuals this particular editions afterword calls the books government a socialist one i say capitalism runs red just as easily  all that made for my not liking the book very much sure its praised to high heaven and the linguistic acrobatics were rather nifty but neither aspect appeals much to my humanity for in the end whatever chapter your edition ends with its far too easy to trap oneself in the books dichotomy of free violence vs emasculated peace the fact that the word emasculated exists in the first place without a consequential converse of enfeminated and the like guarantees the worlds bloodlusty cry of an answer from the getgo what is needed is to break down the boundaries of this book completely and branch out into areas where the interplay is not always one of beat downer and beaten down but of a realization that beating should be condemned period boys dont beat up girls out of the chivalric urge of pedestal pinning for however long that wins out against the objectifying need for proof of masculinity but boys shouldnt be beating up boys either if you dont want to deal with the aftermath embodied in a clockwork orange dont breed them from birth  am i a weakwilled pussy for saying that sure why not one the pussy is one of the strongest and most resilient muscles in the human body unlike the much praised balls that do the frightened snail whenever theres the smallest drop in temperature two all that contemptuous passive aggressive pansy scaredycat etc etc of the schoolyard catcalls and business place joshing its bullshit utter bullshit if babyboomers want to know where all their sweet children have grown their fangs and spines look no further than their back in my day tripe  finally i liked the bits warning about governments deeming what is to be punished and acting accordingly i really did however as it would take a sizeable uscentric leap to the current prisoner pipeline war on drugs fiasco of racial disenfranchisement and constitutionalized slavery look up the th amendment if you dont believe me its too much of a free range clich for me to accredit i cant fault burgess for not knowing about it as much as i do but that was then us readers of today need to be connecting the dots and until that happens this book is as much of a cauterization as it is a plague i found this a rather difficult book to get in to mainly because of all the slang still a decent read though  reviews and more at   im very mixed about this book very mixed sure it was dark and there were disturbing scenes but throughout the novel i found it hard to connect to the story or understand the motives of the characters  we have alex a fifteen year old who enjoys all manners of violence including rape he never feels any remorse and is generally just a nasty piece of work inside and out his character along with those of his fellow droogs never felt really fleshed out just like the author had thrown a whole bunch of nasty elements together to make a character what i mean is we dont ever really see why they are the way they are only that they enjoy what theyre doing i would have liked it if the author had delved more into their backgrounds as for me this would have made the whole thing seem more real  another thing that made this story hard to get into was the constant made up slang throughout the narrative this i found made the whole thing quite difficult for me to understand as in my copy there was no glossary i totally understand how the author wanted us to really hear alexs voice and experience his world but there is such a thing as overkill  but on to the things i did like the author really succeeded in making a dark atmosphere here and i must say i really liked the discussion topic raised with this book  is it better for a man to have chosen evil than to have good imposed upon him  anthony burgess a clockwork orange  this i found an interesting topic to explore and i know many people will have different opinions on this heck im not even sure what my own opinion is but i know the author explored this topic really well despite the fact that i didnt really understand the ending   so to top it all off this was a dark novel with an interesting topic but was a bit difficult to get into due to all the made up words i tried really hard to enjoy this book i really did the slang in it drove me crazy not even just a little bit crazy i was on the verge of putting this book down just because i could not be fucking bothered working out what each random as fuck word meant it just seemed like such an odd choice for the book surely a story about the deterioration of society would be more poignant and important if there were aspects of modern society and language within it everything was such a far cry from our life or even the life that i see as plausible that it just felt weird  i did enjoy the story but i disliked the way it was told it took me until about halfway through this book to actually get into it a little bit and it should never take that long to get into a story i think this book was interesting and i can see why people enjoy it but i wouldnt recommend it to people really i kind of wish i had just watched the movie instead and saved myself some time weird book it kind of gives off the message even rapists and murderers mature toward the end though it has a unique writing style the way the main character talks is really interesting a mix of old english and some russian words and it absorbs you from the beginning to the end i read this in one sitting couldnt put it down since i wanted to see what was gonna happen in the end  burgess may have intended to make the reader sympathize a bit with the antiherovillain of this book because even when you see how evil alex is his story doesnt turn you off enough to stop reading it its probably because of the narrators way of telling the reader his horrible deeds even if you get disturbed the mocking tone of the language makes you feel like none of this is real andor more than a joke somehow that illusion is always there so you keep reading because you want to see what will happen next and how these characters will face their punishment  we also see burgess exploring the ideas of morality the good and the bad what if being good was something forced on you and you didnt have a choice youd be good not because you really wanted to be good or atone yourself but because youd have to then where exactly would the moral values fit in this kind of picture a clockwork orange is a good book to start asking yourselves these kinds of questions you have to give anthony burgess a lot of credit for the amazing job he did creating the dystopian future london shown in this novel his invented language im assuming created out of thin air was mindblowing and really made me feel like i had left my world behind  ironically i think that was part of my problem with the novel i felt out of place and unsure of myself for a good portion of it because i really struggled with the language like being a tourist in a hostile city  i know its not fair to hold burgess at fault because his genius at writing exceeded my reading ability but i dont know how else to review this i liked it and i was thoroughly impressed by it but it wasnt an experience i enjoyed enough to rate higher than  stars  for those of you much smarter andor more patient than me this is an orginal work of dystopian science fiction  stars for a clockwork orange audiobook by anthony burgess read by tom hollander i know that this is a classic and its interesting to listen to but i really cant make out whats going on in the story the narration is good but i think its been to long sense ive seen the movie its  are we any closer to the answers to all of these same old same old questions but dear chapter  part three its definitely not just a phase im inclined to believe authors opinions about their own works so when burgess in his introduction says i should myself be glad to disown it i tend to accept such judgment at face value and proceed to look for reasons why he should feel this way its similar to how i felt with john fantes the road to los angeles which was published posthumously after fante sat on it for basically his entire adult life  he didnt think it merited publication and contrary to some adoring reviewers he was right  it takes a certain amount of arrogance as a reviewer or critic to say that an authors work is actually better than heshe thinks it is youre basically saying the author whose work you love doesnt know what theyre talking about a puzzling way indeed to make your point  but burgess is of course right about his own work it is only barely a novel and re
All Quiet on the Western Front,i enjoyed volume  of don quixote quite a lot it had a lot of charm to it despite the unrelenting misogyny the endless exalting of the virtues of christianity and the overt racism all without the benefits of paragraph breaks this was written in  what do you expect but none of that couldnt really squash the spirit of this volume as it followed don quixote who fancied himself a real life knighterrant like all those knights he read about in all those books he loved so much and went galavanting around the countryside to right wrongs and save damsels granted he ended up hurting and assailing more innocents than he rescued and he spoilt much wine in the process and possibly bankrupted a poor much put upon innkeeper his squire sancho knows quixote is crazy but he slowly gets sucked into the delusion himself and starts dreaming about owning his own island some day and everyone around them can only scratch their heads wonder at what happened and try to figure out ways to break quixote of his delusion even going so far as to burn his books  like i said its quite charming and humorous in its own quirky way and i liked especially that it was selfaware and even a bit meta as it unwound its tale of the mad knightapparent and his beleaguered squire who was really much too old to be a squire the runon soliloquies and hyperbolic speech just added to the zaniness even went it goes off to bring in another whole different book that still kept in the spirit of the story  all around a fun time much more so than i was expecting the only issue i had with this was trying to figure out where to start it because there was so much extra stuff at the beginning of the book and various different books i looked at all seemed to have different stuff and different starting points i ended up listening to this on librivox figuring id let someone else figure out which of that stuff was necessary i listened to version  which splits the story between vol  and vol  into two separate files and the reader did a fairly good job he read didnt perform so there wasnt much if any variation of voices for different characters i recommend going that route if youre feeling intimidated about where and how to tackle this story   dnf star for volume   this had some promise at the very beginning in how it went very meta with the characters and the success of the first volume and how critics and fans responded to it but then it very quickly started to feel like the author didnt know what to do with these characters and i really got the impression he was only writing this because of popular demand not because he had anything further to say in this world and everyone got mean laughing at quixotes ongoing mental delusion and even starting to directly question how sancho could put up with him or why he thought quixote could actually get him that island he dreamt of but his wife didnt want it was like all the charm was gone and everything that made the first volume special was missing i finally couldnt take it anymore and quit at  but i added volume  by itself to my shelf so i could at least get credit for reading that lol these are looooong  honestly this part isnt really needed at all and youd be just fine if you only read volume  its embarrassing how this took me over three months to read its not even hard to read despite being written hundreds of years ago its because im not into comedy especially monty python the master and margarita type  the humour that i appreciate is more black or ironic with don quixote it feels like i got the joke the first time if you know what i mean while the book is up to a thousand pagesworth of repeating it  however i appreciate how cervantes subverted the chivalric tradition in don quixote his noble madman who believes quite seriously that he is a knight and there is much humour in the adventures he seeks out such as believing windmills are giants and fighting them his loyal squire sancho panza a simple and gluttonous peasant fond of proverbs is a comic character in his own right added to this is how other people receive or find entertainment in don quixotes madness and in the second book the author often aims invective towards an interloper author in real life who had written a follow up book about don quixote passing it off as cervantess work  in madrid last year i remember finding myself clambering about the statues of don quixote and sancho in the plaza de espana and thought that they looked remarkably shaggy for statues which are normally glorifying now i get it and it is cool to have a fuller understanding of the origin of the word quixotic as well in the end many people love don quixote for his true nobility even as this is a parody and as with much humour there can be a straddling line of tragedy  don quixote is known as the knight of the sorrowful face  and there is a certain tragic aspect to his quixotic that feels postmodern to use here crusade of idealisation and fantasy against realism im reading don quixote as part of my websites reading challenge  now that ive cracked the  page mark that is ive reached page  maybe i should share my thoughts about the story so far i think its a silly story i should also add that i think shakespeares a midsummer nights dream is silly too im not regretful that my serious reading choice for  is don quixote strange i refer to a silly story a comedic story as a serious read its serious for me because its a struggle to read it its a book ive had on my list for a long time its on my classics list because i want to expand my reading horizons beyond the easy to read entertainers a couple of years ago i did an evening class on the subject of the art of reading and it was at that time i decided to choose a classic from the enormous list of important books a new translation of don quixote had just been published the edith grossman translation and there was a lot of buzz about it so it became my choice the first problem was its physical size it was the size of a house brick not practical to lug it around so it went onto the bookshelf for several years now years later the situation has changed the reading world has changed im an avid follower of book bloggers who inspire me to once again tread the classics path so with the help of an ebook reader kindle and an audiobook audiblecom ive got no excuse so one chapter a day until ive finished will mean i have experienced a story considered important along the way i may discover why its important and at the very least my reading muscle will get stronger nearly  hours lateri have slain the beast i did not enjoy this beast however i have found that classics dont tend to be my thing  im glad to be done im glad to say i didnt dnf thats all im glad for with this book  i would not recommend unless youre a big fan of literary classics its dense and so so so long the windmills bit is right at the beginning and it seems like maybe nobody reads past that if thats the case they are wiser than i am don quixote is a satirisation of all the chivalric tales that preceded it and yet despite don quixote being a subversion of all knights errant in fiction he becomes for us more real than any of them for through his madness and the realness of the world he inhabits we bear witness to the impossibility of a knight incarnate of fiction blending with reality as it parodies the absurdity of being a knight in a world where such a thing is ludicrous and nonexistent this dichotomy of reality and fiction makes for some truly amusing scenes but the escalation of the absurdity however becomes so extreme at times to the point of being ridiculous and tiresome it loses its entertaining quality by overwhelming the reader with its deceit that is it undermines the very thing it sets out to achieve by going so overthetop that the reader or at least this one cant help but feel that certain parts are ridiculous without being funny that its so exaggerated that you cant help but to cringe at how bad it is  the book also has the drawbacks of being longwinded digressive peppered with plot holes a tad sexist repetitive especially with the unending discussions about past knights and their deeds and sections that are so impossibly coincidental that no suspension of belief can pardon the poorly executed fabrication  on the plus side don quixote is the perfect heideggerian example of a character who seeks authenticity through his pursuit of becoming a realised knight and who is undeterred by the world wanting him to conform a world that wishes to put off his realisation of authenticity by remaining inauthentic don quixote despite being dissed by the corruptible masses becomes through his deeds the embodiment of a knight who is the paragon of virtue when the world thinks him mad don quixote becomes the authentic outsider truly achieving who he wants to be regardless of what others may think or say by the end though the naysayers want him to remain a knight for their own amusement to make a mockery of the one who became authentic making the point that though authenticity as an ideal is exemplary there will always be those who criticise and ridicule you who will essentially deny your right to be who you want to be  as i was reading don quixote my reading experience started off with a strong four stars but then as the book progressed my opinion dwindled from three stars down to two dont get me wrong don quixote is at times hilarious and entertaining i can see why so many people love itit certainly has mass appealbut it is far too flawed in my opinion and thus undeserving of being esteemed as one of the greatest novels of all time me no understand point don don quixote me have one or two laugh but me no understand why so many word don don quixote make fun nightserrant is sateyeerr but too many word that make me zzz i want like don don quixote but word page put me to zzz word pages write four million years ago it very old long word page with no many real thing to say story simple  crazy dumb dumb go out pretend nightserrant but crazy dumb dumb no need for so many word page no recommendation  although don quixote and sancho are both amusing characters i got desperately bored of them within the first  pages of this book it was only near the end that i started to really enjoy it again with the addition on stories that didnt circulate around don quixote all in all a pleasant read but no one that i thought ive gained anything from ill admit i was intimidated by this one and have been politely dodging it for years for fear that i wouldnt enjoy it very much well turns out i didnt enjoy it very much the scene with the windmills was hilarious and there were quite a few funny spots throughout but i found that i just didnt care for the story all that much and the tangents  holy shit the tangents it just wasnt my thing finally done   tbh i enjoyed the first few chapters i had some good laughs but it became tedious repetitive and literally nonsense i hope it ended with the first book rd quarter long read for gr group catching up on the classics  due to other reading commitments for august i cant complete this by the end of the quarter unfortunately i did not start this in early july as i should have  i may pick it up again in the future when i am not over booked with other reading commitments  well i did pick it up again and i finished it here are my comments  like a lot of people i had heard bits and pieces over my lifetime of this book and boy was i wrong concerning what this book is about i was aware that the story involved a character called don quixote who had delusionsand he in fact did have them but i was under the impression that there was some sort of lessons to be learned from cervantes character or some sort of social commentary about his time from don quixotes absurdity i was mistaken cervantes expressed in the introduction that he wanted to make fun of what in his time seemed to be a plethora of ridiculous histories of knights errant and perhaps put a stop to them or to show that they were not real and were also examples of bad literature so no this book had no social commentary but perhaps its purpose was literary criticism of a trend in popular literature of the time  i had also heard praise of cervantes prose style that is so celebrated that spanish is often referred to as the language of cervantes unfortunately the quality of his writing was lost in translation i did not see anything special about the writing at all this is interesting because i read a novel translated from japanese called the waiting years by fumiko enchi this past july as a botm with another gr group and we all remarked on how moved were by the writing and its quality even in translation i was not moved or impressed with cervantes writing in translation as i was with this classic of japan  this book was divided into par i and part ii part i was funny in some places and part ii was terrible and bore little resemblance to part i it almost seemed as if they were written by two different authors in fact several years had passed before cervantes felt compelled to write part ii in response to a plagiarist of part i  i am only going to discuss part i because i could find very little merit in part ii and i regret the time spent to read it  one this that did impress me was cervantes ability to write good slapstick there were some amusing situations that i would describe as slapstick in nature that made me giggle aloud one was the blanketing of sancho panza and also the goings on in the garret at the inn where our hero his squire sancho panza a carrier and one of the female employees of the inn who seemed to regularly supplement her wages by servicing  male guests at the inn for a price and had bad breath at one point all of these people and possibly others were all crammed in the garret and this reminded me of the famous scene form the marx brothers classic movie a night at the opera when a large number of people came to be crammed into a very tiny stateroom on during an ocean crossing aboard a ship  famous scene from the marx brothers movie  so to conclude if you must read this i recommend that you only read part i and bypass part ii it bore little resemblance to part i which had some amusing moments there was nothing amusing or entertaining about part ii skip it besides the endearing if surreal main characters there is some very clever framing and allegory going on in this book far more i suspect than i was ever fully aware of and obviously theres a sense of magic to read something written  years ago in a foreign language on the other side of the world  the bad i feel like much of this book passed me by or at least i missed a lot of what cervantes intended i was always conscious of being centuries disconnected from the audience for whom don quixote was written and as with any translation something is inevitably lost i found it more interesting than entertaining and it took me over  months to finish  friends character the protagonist is most like there is the title character don quixote  alonso to his amigos  but i was never certain the actual protagonist of the story wasnt sancho panza either way alonso is deluded and forthright and sancho is the insightful cretin with the heart of gold the whole book reminded me of that episode where phoebe lets a bee sting her just to prove there are selfless good deeds and joey tells her the bee is probably dead now im done its taken me over half a year to get through the very often dry wordy and pointless tale of done quixote but ive done it am i glad i read it yeees i suppose so but more because it was a classic that would have begged me to read it for the rest of my life than be because i actually got a lot out of it there were parts that were interesting  but then there were parts that were completely unrealistic  and in part two which originally was published some time after part one the author kept ranting through various characters about how terrible some other authors sequel to don quixote was  so anyway this is one of those books that though im glad i went through the pain of reading it just to know more about don quixote and all the mentions to him i might come across in life and to put another classic novel on my list i wont find the need to ever pick it up again did i finish don quixote or did it finish me   not my cup of tea it was repetitive and extremely tedious the chapters were episodic there was no flow characters come and go i just couldnt relate to anything  apparently the book is funny i mustve missed the jokes  i hear the spanish version is way more engaging maybe it was a translation issue not for me  shelved after  pages i am sure it is a fine work but the somewhat archaic language and writing style meant i couldnt connect with it it is finally finished thank god i thought it would never end  i know this is considered one of the best novels of all time and very important not only in spanish literature but worldwide but it just wasnt for me it does have funny moments and great language great job done by the translator and it does successfully parody chivalric romances but it was just too cumbersome and repetitive at last i made it  pages of small print and some sleepless nights a classic book first published in  and this edition translated into english by jmcohen was brought out in  the translators introduction did set the scene for the book and states that much of the quoted poetry did not translate well into english he was correct the first part of the adventures are very much the best with small chapters containing his exploits as the self styled don quixote de la mancha and his squire sancho panza all to the glory of his imaginary mistress dulcinea del toboso he thinks the inn is a castle and rescues the boy who is being lashed by his master this episode soon finds the pair back at home where his books of knight errantry are burned by his niece the housekeeper and with the connivance of his friends the pair set out again and this leads to the tilting at windmills which he thinks are giants then the fulling mills notes to dulcinea that sancho does not deliver and finding anselmo and his unrequited love throughout the story there are lots of fainting maidens that have loved one man and been betrothed to another although most of these work out well in the end there are so many similar adventures that they become repetitive and increasingly the characters are vindictive and mean to bait don quixote and be violent towards sancho in turn sancho unleashes increasing numbers of proverbs into his speech which become tedious don quixote eventually goes to barcelona where he is again set up by the local nobleman who exploits his madness for pleasure eventually batchelor sampson carrusco from his home village and dressed as the knight of the shinning moon and wanting to bring him back home without harm knocks him down and don quixote yields and returns home with minor adventures along the way at home he quickly succumbs to a fever and rouses to make his will and dies some of the adventures are entertaining but the volume and similarity take away the pleasure by the end i had had enough and believe that many copies of this story go unread at least throughout  stars only for me started off great but it becomes so messy why do the people let him live in a fantasy world just mean one of the reasons i love readalongs is how they help me to get through a challenging book they keep me focused and give my reading a purpose the support of my fellow readalongers is an integral part of the process but sadly none of this is helping me get through don quixote  it reminds me of my attempts to read catch the humour is amusing and clever to start with but by the the half way mark if not before it just becomes tedious in its repetitiveness so many of my good friends love catch and so many of my blogger friends love don quixote along with a large number of authors that i respect and admire what have i missed with both of these books  i like to think that im an intelligent person who is reasonably wellread and not afraid to tackle some of the heftier books when the mood strikes so i saw the satire and the cleverness in both books i appreciated the intentions of the authors i enjoyed some of the set pieces and the themes but ultimately they didnt move me engage me or entertain me they left me scratching my head in bemusement  with don quixote i kept waiting for something different to happen for some growth or insight it never happened  well it certainly didnt happen in part one  i had heard that part two was a better read with all sorts of exciting prepostmodern metafiction so imagine my disappointment when i quickly discovered that it was more of the same but with parodyand more even poems  the whole time i was reading dq i kept seeing and hearing the cisco kid and pancho  the characters from a s tv show that i watched in reruns during my s childhood every time quixote said sanchos name i heard ciscos famous ohhhh paaaaaancho in my head instead  just like the tv western don quixote is episodic and full of copious amounts of frame storiesnot my favourite form of literature perhaps i should have read one chapter a week spinning each episode out with an anticipatory break in between  i enjoyed the brief glimpses into life in rural spain and watching the very first oddcouple literary pairing in action but i failed to find much humour  there was ridiculousness and absurdity and some slapstick but nothing to laugh out loud about don quixote was sad and mad and sancho ignorant and trusting not figures i could poke fun at or find it amusing to see others do so  so reluctantly and with some regret i abandon the readalong and leave don quixote and sancho to continue riding around the spanish countryside in search of adventures and injustices to right according to goodreads i made it to the  mark which i think is giving it a fair go in anyones books there was a review i read years ago about moby dick that talked about how there are only two reactions one can have to the book either unadulterated love for it or wishing that melville would have cut a good  or so pages from the novel  in regards to moby dick i am in the former camp and this comment from a reviewer who i dont remember has stuck with me for years because ive never been able to understand how anyone can hate that masterpiece so much reading don quixote however put this comment into perspective for me i read up to the windmill chapter for a literature course at my uni last semester and loved everything about it and became very excited to finally read the whole thing and prove to harold blooms ghost that i truly am a lover of literature sadly everything after the first hundred pages fell flat for me i found the majority of both parts excluding the beginnings of each and the closing chapters of part  which are some  star material to be such an extreme change in quality that none of the bits i loved could save me from the vitriolic reaction of repeatedly smashing my head in with a cast iron skillet because i kept reading the same joke for  pages now would i have ended up rating this five stars if the duke and duchess chapters didnt total like a fourth of the book maybe thank goodness i am finished this epically long and boring book one month and  hours of listening later it is done  i really really dislike books that rely on mocking characters to offer the humour in the story and this book was just that for the whole thing it grates on my sense of kindness and fair play and how annoying is it that everyone is the most beautiful woman or the most handsome man and there is money and poetry and book burning and a whole lot of ignorant people it was all too much while this book did provide stories with comedic relief it was boring and not to date the part with the windmills was fun don quixote is at its best when the titular character goes mad in a word annoying on a lot of levels a while ago someone told me not to bother reading this and im annoyed i ignored them and that they were right annoying that at times this hit some really good almost dumasworthy notes but mainly when don quixote was off stage the first quarter of the book basically involves the protagonist behaving like a complete  and i almost gave up i persevered through bloody mindedness and it did get better but the point where i told myself i could have weekends off from reading this condemned it to a two star rating there are genuinely funny bits in this just not enough compared to the great swathes of boring stuff to make it effective its easy to understand why don quixote is a literary classic as it is an effective deconstruction of chivalry and similar aspects of knighthood it emphasizes the silliness of the characters and the ridiculousness of don quixotes delusion of grandeur and its meeting with the real world to make the audience laugh at the silliness of the situation credit where its due it is an interesting deconstruction don quixote feels like a character rather than an empty parody and sometimes it does have an interesting or smart twist the biggest problem with the book comes in the form of the humor  it has been said that humor ages quickly and most often badly i feel that don quixotes comedic inputs is the bane of the books quality there is a scene near the beginning of the book where a child is being beaten by his master and don quixote stops the man telling him to pay the child then leave before it can be done which leads to the child almost being flogged to death while i have no problem with reading about the terrifying reality of the medieval period i do have a problem with it being plaid for laughs i dont mean to sound like a buzzkill but a mentally unstable person beating up people and in turn being beaten up for his delusions isnt something i can laugh at when the humor isnt about how funny it is that someone got seriously injured it mocks people and their morals living in a society where multiple opinions are accepted and even discussed seriously i cant find it funny because we do not have the same regime of morality that we did back then am i supposed to laugh at a man who wishes to marry his daughter off to someone of higher rank or his wife who thinks that she should marry her off within her class i dont see why its supposed to be funny  in conclusion i think don quixote is a book that has not aged well but still have value as a deconstruction of knighthood and a guide to make better parodies than most we get i dont really get this book at all i dont think i guess it was like one of the first things that resembled a novel that ever came out when it came out maybe thats why its so famous but still it must have something enduring to say for people to be still reading it today mustnt it the humor all seems to be of the sort that is ugly and at someones expense though it makes me wince to read it i didnt feel amused at all in fact someone please explain it to me why its such a beloved book  i do get that the reader feels affectionate toward quixote despite his dementia and psychoses we feel in a way that hes admirable even though hes totally disconnected with reality i guess it shows that we wish life were more fairytalelike and less real than it is with more castles and fewer inns perhaps more courtly knights and fewer crazy maniacs it pokes fun of much of literature for being so darn highflown and unrealistic but is that it i cant believe it would have lasted centuries on the strength of nothing more than that please enlighten me i study literature and since everyone in my class had read this book  and loved it  i had to read it as well so many people recommended it to me and so many of my teachers praised the book so my expectations were fairly high  and as a result i ended up being gravely disappointed  the book is very interesting in its form as the author experiments with metafiction and intertextuality deconstructing the typical form of the classic novel analytically this is a very complex and artistic work  as a reading experience however it fails miserably in all fairness the book did make me laugh once or twice but after a while the comic episodes just felt like rewritings of the same joke in my opinion the book could easily be cut at least  pages which is a lot  it is not that i dont get the historic significance or importance of the novel i just didnt enjoy reading it this book was so repetitive and so long there are only so many times you can read about an old crazy guy being beat up ill admit there were some funny moments and stories sprinkled throughout the book but the overwhelming feeling was boredom i am so glad im done and can check this off my list and never read it again
The Stand,dear stephen  im sorry i just dont like you in that way i know weve been friends for a long time but i just never developed those kind of feelings for you even after eleven hundred pages i feel like we only moved forward in fits and stops and we were just never able to sustain a kind of evenhanded development of the kind of chills and thrills a person really likes shock someone enough times with snot running out of their nose and it just becomes a little meaningless and there are only so many ways to view a dead body before one gets kind of numb instead of apprehensive using the journal device to move things forward seems a little crude when what we really need to do is talk  i have to confess ive felt kind of uncomfortable watching you struggle with religion and spirituality you sparked my interest when you posited that this might be the battle between the age of reason and that of irrationalism and the dark man was the last vestige of doomed rationalism i thought for a few minutes we were headed somewhere really special but you didnt seem very confident and the theme fell apart  i will say there were a few surprises along the way which i found pleasant i appreciate you avoiding the obvious character arcs especially when it comes to redemption i was glad to meet most of your friends especially joeleo stu and even kojak your military friends bored me out though especially starkey i dont even get why you like spending any time with those guys such a bunch of fossils i do have to say i was really impressed with how you must have studied disease modelling and progressioni almost felt like was there  sometimes i get the feeling that you dont really see me as a person just a babymaker you even have an extended soliloquy about it as if i wasnt even here reading your words it bothers me because you took the time to develop nuanced male relationships larry stu lloyd but the women were about reproducing or were cannon fodder since you allowed technology to remain im not going to buy into your lowest mostfunctional society mentality no matter how many sociological theories you throw at me and then theres the elderly black woman as representation of all thats spiritual perhaps even mother earth if im rolling my eyes its because its another aspect of compartmentalizing women as either maiden matron or crone and people of color as closer to godsbeing savage and all as you so helpfully illustrate in your the circle closes afterward honestly its kind of juvenile and a little disappointing when i know you are capable of so much more  its time for me to move on im sure youll find someone special eventually stephen because you are such a really great guy and so unusual too  with three stars  your friend always goodness me this book was a chore it took me nearly a month to finish and by the  day mark i was really regretting reading the unabridged version and along the way i realised that this is a classic case of me liking the idea of the book so much more than the book itself which is so unfortunate  i thought the beginning started off really strong i was enjoying seeing how the plague affected everyone differently and the lengths everyone had to take to survive the mass confusion and looming death oh and nick nick is the best thing to come out of fiction since i dont know when and although an attachment to a character is enough motivation to finish a book its sometimes not enough to actually enjoy the book entirely  what really made me check out was when the dreams started becoming a major focal point to the plot i just could not get behind the whole mother abigail vs randall flagg story line i understand that stephen king has wonderful and deep messages in his books but if im not really engaged with the story then im not going to invest the extra time to try to analyse everything so i know i missed out there but i cant bring myself to care more about it  so what began as an interesting story turned into a very religious subtext of good vs evil its an ambitious story but one i just wasnt quite feeling by the end moon that spells i am done with this moonstrosity of a tome  this is the biggest single book ive ever read in my life so farits k words and its even bigger than oathbringer by brandon sandersonand although it doesnt go into my personal favorite list i enjoyed the majority of the book  the stand is totally not what i expected i really thought this would be a super thrilling plotdriven with a lot of actions book due to the nature that the story revolves around a plague outbreak as it turns out the stand is a highly characters driven book with the plot moving at a very slow pace and as great as it was sometimes it did get a bit excruciating  one of the two that stands out the most from this bookother than the gigantic sizein my opinion was the theological nature and the classic tale of a battle between good versus evil  that wasnt any act of god that was an act of pure human fuckery   there are a lot of symbolism to the aspect of light versus darkness here to give one example of many with the country being ravaged by the outbreak the survivors ended up joining either mother abagails group the good or randal flaggs group the evil mother abagail is located in the east where the sun rises every day and randal flagg is located in the west where the sun set i enjoyed reading almost all the characters perspectives and survivors tales and i really think if you love a heavy theological talk in your fiction this is a mustread  the beauty of religious mania is that it has the power to explain everything once god or satan is accepted as the first cause of everything which happens in the mortal world nothing is left to chancelogic can be happily tossed out the window   other than the theological talk the characters were almost absolutely delightful to read the characters developments in this book were astounding to say the least and it was awesome to see how far these characters changed from where they began plus stephen king writes very unconventional and memorable characters in the stand such as nick tom cullen randal flagg harold larry and mother abagail to name a few  picture mother abagail by bernie wrightson    now the parts that didnt work for me first being stephen kings prose took quite a while for me to get used to second and probably my major problem with the book the trashcans man chapters were atrocious i didnt enjoy any moment reading his pov it was messy felt juvenile and during my time reading it i knew immediately this his meeting with the kid was going to be the one that was cut out from the first published edition of this book and i was right it was a painful  pages chapter which in my opinion offer close to zero points to the story finally with a book this huge i really expected the ending to blow me away but the ending ended up being anticlimactic i also cant help but think that the first edition of this book the  pages one would probably be a better experience stephen king received the title word diarrhea for a great reason and a lot of the words in this book in my opinion definitely deserves to be flushed  overall though i think the stand is still overall a great book even though its not a genre that i dive into frequently i found myself amazed by the characterizations and compelled to read what happened to most of the characters its unfortunate that there were a few hiccups with the pacing and ending but i still will recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed a heavy theological discussion and memorable characters in their read thank you also to my good friend celeste for giving me this book as a late birthday present  you can find this and the rest of my adult epichigh fantasy  scifi reviews at booknest i read this book ages ago but its fresh in my mind every time i wind up stuck in traffic underneath the hudson  its about almost everyone in the world basically catching a bad case of the plague and dropping dead this premise doesnt seem very farfetched which could make it either more or less entertaining depending on your temperment  heres my opinion about good old stevie king hes got a real problem with endings hell spin these long terrific stories but way too often theyre all based in suspense and he lures you to page  or whatever and leaves you high and dry i read the first half of it in sixth grade and had to stop as the book had completely deprived me of my ablity to sleep two years later id finally recovered enough to brave it again and the ending was so stupid that i sorely wished id saved myself months of clownterror wakefulness by finishing it the first time i mean dont get me wrong the guy can write but he almost invariably writes himself into a corner and his endings are a letdown  the great thing about the stand to me is that king a demonstrates that hes aware of this problem and b uses his weakness jujitsu style combined with wishfulfillment to great effect you can just see him crouched at his typewriter chewing on something and grumbling christ whats my problem these goddamn endings i just need a deus ex machina  i liked the stand the stands good stuff its not one of the scary ones well its scary in a different way than say the shining and in addition to having an ending i appreciate it also gets pretty silly but still recommended yep  considering the popularity of this book therell be no need for me to make this long so just my feelings and impressions while reading this  the first half of this reads like a classic stephen king novel all hell has broken loose and hes generously provided great exposition akin to front row seating for anyone curious to observe how the world might end in meticulously written high definition detail a true class act indeed nevertheless i did find myself getting bored andor transfixed with the worldbuilding and character development in equal measures  the second half deals with how the various remaining forces of good and evil have choosen to remake the wasteland of the world in their respective images i think my problem with this read was that i went into it with expectations of mythic proportions ill still recommend this for both stephen king die hards yet to pick this up and general postapocalyptic fans out there thatll love a very interesting and immersive experience of worldbuilding and character development of truly macabre tints in america even scummy douchebags like you should be able to catch a cold  moon that spells unpopular opinion i do have oh so many of those laws yes   stars rounded up to three i dont want to write this review really i dont i dont want to say that this is far and away my least favorite king book ever i dont want to tell you that the satan versus god war was total bullshit or that king does much better when he writes general good vs evil stories  i dont want to tell you that randall flagg is totally lame that brady hartsfield would bend flagg over his knee and give him a fucking spanking and send him off to his room without supper  to be polite she sipped a little more of the dreadful koolaid  but i have to say these things you see because the stand is  pages of boredom i did not drink the dreadful koolaid  i have been thinking long and hard about this pretty much ever since the book started that was on april  laws yes almost two weeks ago and i cant precisely articulate what exactly it is that i find so boring about it  that was the whole world after all nothing but thoughts and plots  maybe because so much time was spent on the opening on the beginning of the flu was the flu horrifying yeah in a oh god what if this happened for real sort of way could king have done more with it why laws yes i think he could have i would have liked to see the panic overtake the cities the mass exodus the cars crashing the people stomping each other into the dirt and turning ugly in a fight for survival the panic power of a single sneeze in a crowded room  king your constant reader knows you are capable of this instead i was given passing references to the military blocking off roads and shooting people down a code name for a super secret evil government plan that didnt seem like it ever manifested it was all hinted at i dont like you when youre subtle steve i much prefer when you take all the ugly people are capable of and slap me across the face with it thats just the kind of girl i am maybe ive got a little rf on my shoulder  but no one knows how long five minutes is in the dark it might be fair to say that in the dark five minutes does not exist  but thats not all i was more than a little annoyed at the hints of brilliance being reminded of what was to come i saw the beginnings of cujo in there the kid trapped in a hot car surrounded by evil wolves i might have glimpsed pieces of dreamcatcher the beginnings of under the dome little ideas sprinkled all around all these quotes ive included i highlighted  others and will cherish them all but a  page book has to be more than a string of good quotes maybe its a matter of not aging well i dont know might i have liked this if i had read it  years ago when it was first released yeah maybe as it stands i was disappointed and maybe that isnt fair but it is what it is  all my favorite things about kings work are there the characters being real people average joes and janes the underdogs the minute details the baby can you dig your mans the pure nostalgia of his work and somehow they didnt come together in a way that made me love any of it did i love glen sure nick sure tom cullen yes kojak you can bet on it but larry stu ralph joe lucy abagail i really didnt care they were to quote the book no great loss  the flu didnt just leave survivor types why the hell should it  i think my problem in the end was the distance between the good and the evil here theres something wildly impersonal about this story randall flagg wants to be evil just for the sake of being evil brady hartsfield is the same but hes not afraid to do his own dirty work in fact he wouldnt have it any other way mindfucking people into being bad for you just doesnt carry the same weight as brady throttling a car into a crowd of people in need just because he can just because he wants the world to suffer with him  there were some high points that chapter that glimpses the second wave the nonsurvivor types the world left behind absolute gold as far as im concerned it was the best chapter in the book that was what i wanted more of if were going to use third person omniscient we should be using it for exactly this the kid from what i understand he wasnt in the original which baffles me because he too was one of the highlights like a junior rennie with his brain fully intact  that was an act of pure human fuckery  there were consistencycontinuity errors the ending was hugely unsatisfying many character arcs are never given legitimate conclusions i now understand why people thought king couldnt write women at one point the stu offers to get frannie a washing machine a washing machine for when the electricity comes back on so she wont have to break her back doing all the laundry and what does she do she throws her arms around him and kisses him uhuh not in my house stu redman you better get yourself a goddamn washing machine or you better find a fucking time machine and travel back to   beyond all that it was incredibly messy for a king book there were the bizarre alternating timelines spliced into the middle sudden in their appearance and just as sudden in their disappearance  after all the only practical compensation for having a nightmare is waking up and realizing it was all just a dream  the foreshadowing and the supernatural didnt jive with the ending we were given minor spoiler at first it seems like the people who are immune to the flu are the ones who dream and people who arent regular dreamers die kojak one of the worlds only surviving dogs is a dreamer later its explained that children who are the product of two immune parents are also immune well which of these is the determining survivor factor genetics or dreams ill accept either answer but i wont accept both either the dreams make them safe or they dont if its not the dreams those shouldnt have been happening until after the plague had done its work if its genetics then in theory wouldnt any survivors also have to have surviving family members the whole premise fell apart because the book couldnt decide if it wanted to be fantasy or science fiction  i just cant express it any clearer than to say i was disappointed when society caves in on itself and king writes books about it i expect the worst of his characters i expect there to be johnnydogood types with questionable pasts i expect there to be charming cunning wolves in sheeps clothing who mostly win until they dont instead i got a world full of mostly decent people who do bad things with one oddly levitating demon pulling their strings  the lord is my shepherd he recited softly i shall not want for nothing he makes me lie down in the green pastures he greases up my head with oil he gives me kungfu in the face of my enemies amen  god bless tom cullen laws yes thats all i have to say about that the last stephen king book that id read before this one was the green mile and that one just blew my mind unfortunately the stand didnt live up to my expectations im fully aware that many love this book and say its possibly kings best but for me it was definitely just average king  the book started off well and the first chapter definitely had my attention i was immersed in the story until around halfway through and that was when i began to lose interest and i felt i simply wasnt invested enough in the story  this book is advertised as an epic thriller so that was what i was expecting but instead i felt like the book did have some thrilling scenes in it but it moved at an incredibly slow pace in its defence though the character development was incredibly detailed although i cannot say that i had a favourite  i had absolutely no time or tolerance for trashcan man the chapters with him in were horrendous and for me added nothing to the story what was his purpose  i found the ending was anticlimactic and im left pretty disappointed especially for a stephen king read i know what hes capable of and i wanted more from a book that was  pages im hoping my next king read will be better moon that spells done  damn what a long book not the longest ive ever read but definitely close  that being said though i didnt find myself thinking wow this could have been cut out or gee this is dragging and so honestly i cant say id recommend the abridged version over this you just gotta be prepared to settle in for a while  i think part of what hurt this book for me were my prereading expectations this is widely considered one of kings best works if not his best but opinions on king cover such a huge spectrum because the man really does have tons of different books to choose from  but for some reason i had it in my mind that this book covered a battle of epic proportions between forces of good  evil but that didnt really develop or at least it wasnt as epic as i expected  the book is very character driven and while i did enjoy the characters it felt a little disproportionate to the action there was a very coherent web of characters that fanned out from the core and many of them were likable in their own ways it just took a long time for things to get going  i was far more interested in randall flagg who was the embodiment of evil than in mother abigail who was the embodiment of good i knew beforehand that this book had many religious themes but unfortunately those themes didnt  resonate with me i appreciate what king did with them they just didnt strike me in quite the way i like for religious themes in books to  king also name dropped quite a few classics such as lord of the rings  watership down  i could see elements from those classics reflected in this work i thought the way he worked that in was clever  now that i have read both this  the passage by justin cronin i think cronins work might be a little closer to what id look for as a reader both books have their positives  negatives and ive rated them both similarly but cronins characters have stayed with me in ways i dont anticipate kings characters will cronins apocalyptic scenario also felt a lot more terrifying to me which is ironic given how closely kings scenario is to a potential outcome of our real life covid situation  overall very glad to have conquered this beast its one of those books you have a hard time ignoring because so many folks consider it essential reading its also my highest rated king book to date so that gives me hope that maybe hes written a couple other books i can get down with alrighty the stand has always been one of my favorite books but for all the times that ive read it in my life which is quite a lot id never read the original abridgededited version i just prefer usually to read the authors preferred text  the one they wrote before an editor took a hacksaw to it and started cutting pieces away  this book is no exception maybe the overall story didnt change but in my opinion its not as cohesive and brilliant and nuanced a story as the one that we get when we read the uncut version that hacksaw took pieces out but not the references to them that appear later on in the story so its clear that theres missing stuff for instance when tom is hypnotized the guys say to him its just like before only there was no before in this version of the story or frannies trepidation when dealing with her mother that never ever comes to anything at all because we never even see her mother in the story or hear of anything except how bitter she is from rd parties but later theres a reference to her parlor and how that room traumatized frannie with its sterility but the reader of this version never gets to know why its like an alternate universe where things are mostly the same but just not quite exact  but even more than that is all of the missing greatness that is just missing and not alluded to the bracketing codas  with campion and rf add a lot to the uncut version and i missed them here the extended lincoln tunnel scene is gone and that was one of the best most terrifying scenes trashcan mans travels with the kid and the kid himself were missing and i think that that missing section adds a lot to trashys character for me this edition kinda does to him what kubrick did to jack torrance in the shining  it makes them just straight up crazy without any of the stuff that led to their final breakdown what trashy went through with the kid and how that ended up which actually is referenced but unless you know to look for that one youd easily look past it was an important moment in the relationship between trashy and rf  the no great loss chapter is another one that i missed in this edition i love when king does those little vignettes they are so effective at showing the breakdown of society and how people react when things start to go bad  so i honestly think that the editor who pushed the issue and convinced whoever was in charge that this book needed to be shortened did a disservice to the readers and hurt the story its no improvement just because its shorter but even worse is the lack of copy editing that happened for this edition there were soooooooo many errors this was actually kind of shocking to me because i cant remember ever having read a badly edited king book before so seeing misspelled words typos missing punctuation runon sentences etc was pretty bad granted this book was written near the beginning of his career and im sure that it was cleaned up for the  edition but still so many errors in this edition sadface  anyway i still enjoyed the story mostly but not nearly as much as i enjoy the uncut edition it kinda pains me to give this only  stars but im doing it it just doesnt live up to the complete version at those times it seemed that she was within touching distance of the dark angel that had flown silently over egypt killing the firstborn of every house where the doorpost wasnt daubed with blood that frightened her most of all she became a child again in her fear   i came for the challenge and stayed for the deus ex machina reading this is not a bad idea at all for a few days at the beach it can be accompanied by as much drinking as desired or needed since close attention is hardly required     by the way i think i recall that this was the cover of the edition i read  but i really cant remember there being illustrations in it apparently another example of something funny in the world or in my head can king do this to people can i sue   and i now wonder why do i say i dont remember illustrations as if thats a mystery did i have information that this edition had illustrations can king sue me can the illustrator if there was one perhaps i need a drink  ive read one or two of kings tower series but this is the only one of his other novels ive read this is a much longer and more interesting novel than those others good story certainly kept me reading i didnt read any other books until i was finished and thats saying something for a book of this length  but  ive never cared much for kings writing style basically to me it seems simplistic somehow sort of juvenile maybe its a style that he has crafted just for the genre he writes in in which case it should probably be judged an effective successful style but that genre horror doesnt interest me all that much hence the effective style doesnt ring the bell for me  still it does belong on that beach fun fiction shelf and dont forget your beverages of choice a book about a disastrous plague and also so much more it was a good sk novel i really like post apocalyptic plot and of course with sk telling this story and his great talent for world building and characterization it was an even better mix  how i loved nick and tom larry was one of the characters who had amazing development as the story goes on harold was naturally so easy to hate  why  then the dark man was lame same for trashcan man the ending didnt work out for me i also feel like the beginning of the flu could have been explored more for exemple how the cities lived with it how the panic started to crept in how were things when the survival instinct started kicking in   dont be to intimidated by the length and go for it i would definitely recommend if you like post apocalyptic novels november  was the last time i wrote a book review i can hardly believe its been that long the days where ive been telling myself to pick up the beautiful habit of reading and reviewing again sure flew by to find those days now behind me assembled in a line of more than two years silently reproachful is a bit disheartening  me writing this review now does hint at the bizarre times of the now a pandemic books will be made of but if it takes me a worldwide quarantine to finally get my reviewing butt moving who am i to complain about anything  at the start of the lockdown i was browsing through my bookshelf full of volumes full of long ago promises to myself to be reading them the stand somehow stood out as exceedingly appropriate a big tome to fill the days to come over a thousand pages thats a recordbreaker for me but im sure ive read works with a higher wordcount and dealing with a subject eerily close to reality  the first part of the book the plague which explains the coming of the terrible disease and its developments was my favorite the parallels between the news reports and what was being described in the book were what allowed me to regard the latter with a certain remoteness feeling that it can always be worse much worse and more entertaining  the different personal perspectives of a massscale devastation in the beginning of the book are a great way to introduce the different protagonists whose immediate surroundings are affected differently though similarly in the end inspiring different actions though similar in the end as a result of the big virusridden wave that comes over them its in times of struggle that you really get to know someone and the first chapters amply allow you to get acquainted with stu fran larry and nick and some secondary characters as they say goodbye to loved ones and struggle in their own way to move on the first pages also show first glimpses of the dark man personification of some unspoken evil that manages to scare even those that just survived the worst  after this strong introduction however the story kind of fades out some minor spoilers to tell you what i mean the characters that were so brilliantly introduced become increasingly twodimensional as the pages flew by and that they did youve got to hand it to kings easy prose i started having a hard time distinguishing between even the main male characters all three of them are basically strong silent types and the only distinguishing factors are their names and their labels the redneck the mute and the rockstar the woman so strong and independent in previous chapters becomes the worried mothertobe hands clutched at her neck waiting for her love to come back home most secondary characters are quite obviously expendable and dont go out of their way to endear themselves to the reader they all trot towards an anticlimax that even a hugeass explosion or heroic death cant save them from by the time these people meet their fates death or otherwise you stopped caring about them a long time ago harold and nadine two characters balancing on a line between good and evil provide the most interesting narrative but dont get a lot of pagetime the dark man antagonist extraordinaire is better suited to the darkness of the first part of the book rather than the spotlight which he is put under later on he quickly loses a lot of his magic and mystery and thus his power probably king in pursuit of heavy religious symbolism and in a mission to make the distinction between enduring good and fading evil probably wanted it that way but it doesnt help in terms of a tensionfilled narrative experience the dark man was defeated as soon as he became a person the only real question that remained was which personages would turn out to be cannon fodder and which would be dealt a better card  in the end the most endearing characters for me were kojak the dog and tom the childlike simpleton for doglovers like myself theres a beautiful highlight near the middle of the book that brought tears to my eyes but i dont think its a good sign that amid a cast of characters that are meant to be rich with personal history that are meant to grow on you over the course of a thousand pages the only ones you kind of care about are the two that can get away with being twodimensional and shine in that status the others aim for more but ultimately fail looking worse off as a result  all in all not a bad book its a pageturner with a plot that moves forward in a pleasing pace it rarely bores and it has some sweet moments that may linger as a memory but it doesnt live up to its strong start and felt a bit pulpy at times the book felt much lighter when i was done reading it as opposed to when i first picked it up from the bookshelf metaphorically speaking my home workout exercises dont need to be taken into account here this is a very very very long book that will only get a short review from me  im afraid i did not enjoy this so why did i spend a little over  hours listening to it  well first of all this is a very well written book about the end of civilization and the ensuing battle between good and evil one that had a very interesting beginning but then spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages focused on how the breakdown of society changes the behaviour of its copious amount of characters with very little plot  and while i was mostly bored theres always hope that king pulls this off in the end and the ending just like the beginning was indeed enjoyable and it also felt like ive been on a long journey with these characters though im not a hundred percent sure if thats because king has done it so well or because it took me two and a half months to finish this tome  thankfully this audiobook is narrated by david nathan the guy is fantastic though thats only helpful for german readers of course  overall glad ive finally read it and also very glad that it is over now  final verdict  stars but didnt enjoy it  i loved the beginning but for me personally this was just too long and boring in some parts reading  pages aloud is no easy task i have renewed appreciation for those voice talent aficianados that can belt out an audiobook with a dozen different voices for anything 
Don Quixote,done quixote pun quixote fun quixote none quixote  and thats not entirely true there are some rollicking good times in here but the first part is so much endlessly episodic violence and while the second half becomes calmer and more focused it never got my imagination engaged nor my blood flowing  in fact although i know he really does love it i cant help but feel that brians recommending this to me is similar to the duke and duchess having their fun with don q i feel like brian is pulling a prank on me  that he does not want me to meet my reading goal and is laughingly crowing no karen you will not read  books this year i am preventing you  i will show you despite the amount of time i was stalled on this one i will come right back in the game  but this i did not love this and a lot of it is just context i can appreciate it as an artifact and as a foundation for western literature but it suffers from the fate of any work that was not edited professionally  tastes change over time just in the same way that marilyn monroe would have probably had to drop fifteen pounds to rock our modernday underfed runway ideal so this book could lose a similar amount of text stop frothing bri seriously if this turned up in some slush pile somewhere there would be allll kinds of criticism and it might even get passed around the office lgm a few times to the giggles of the editorial assistants this guy cant even keep the supporting characters wifes name straight this is inconsistent this is repetitivewhat is this interlude that has nothing to do with anything else doing in here this is flatout stolen from another source  an editor would go to town on this puppy  but we have the luxury of reading this  years after it was written and marveling at how fresh and modern it still sounds and part of it is very modern but grossmans frequent cervantes probably meant here or this is the wrong reference would not play in a modern novel if jonathan safran foer had done this there would be a crown of pretentious classics majors drawling i cant believe he said perseus when he meant theseus  guffaw guffaw  but  years down the road we can afford to be more forgiving vanity press authors take heart  and i am aware i am being nitpicky i am more just interested in pointing out how a lot of people who love this book would be very indignant to read something produced today that had so many obvious flaws  but i do admire longevity  i just couldnt get into it overall there are a lot of great moments here the burning of the books nooo the puppet show don q in a cage and great nonaction sequences in the discussions of the value of drama as a medium and the difficulty of translation and many other minor occurrences  the first half is just episode after episode of this delusional thug with some kind of roidrage methaggression attacking people and innocent lions unprovoked and his sidekick who is a grasping fiend who would sell you out for even the promise of a sandwich and it all reads like marx brothers slapsticky stuff i mean how do you break someones nose with a loaf of bread  with the second half it is better and becomes more selfreflexive and much sadder but a lot of it still remains tedious the second half written ten years after the first part frequently references the unauthorized sequel to don q that some guy wrote and pissed cervantes off it is like a mean girl passing notes to the cool kids did you hear what he said thats my man hes messing with etc etc  and i am not a lazy reader even though my tastes tend toward a faster pace than this but i have read plenty of slowpaced dense prose that didnt make me take out my mental red pen and slash away at what i felt was extraneous or repetitious  i can appreciate the message about art and its impact and its potential and its place in the world but i did not have fun reading this book  and i make no apologies    and for jasmine  who doesnt think there is anything complicated or pretentious in the spanish language  this qualifies i think it gets all meta in the second act for its time it was seriously mindbending stuff  my god this was a long book and when i told my boyfriend i was reading this he tried to tell me i should read das kapital with him as well which is almost twice this long like no thank you it was an okay book i definitely enjoyed it more than ive enjoyed other classics ive picked up it kind of reminded me of reading candide because it had that same sort of satirical tone sancho was pretty amusing through out the book and don quixotes adherence to his belief that he was a knight was something some parts were better than others and i think i did enjoy part one of this a lot more than i enjoyed part two the digs at whoever wrote the fake second part however through the actually second part written by cervantes were pretty funny in their pettiness i just also think the ending was kind of ridiculous where don quixote dies on his deathbed and suddenly hes sane and is denouncing chivalry felt dumb and unnecessary when the whole point of the book was to make fun of don quixote for his silliness in trying to imitate the stories of knights and since everything said there had been mentioned in the book at some point i feel like i probably lost out on a lot of the word play since i was reading a translated version though sancho mixing up words was still included through out i got pretty bored hearing don quixote complaining about sanchos proverbs endlessly like how many comments on that does one need definitely enjoyed part one more for the parts of the story that werent just related to don quixote and a footnote said people disliked the inclusion of things like the short novel but i actually liked them and so i missed it in part two just want to take a moment to say contemporary writing is definitely better than any of the classics ive read but i guess its nice to see where the influence is coming from for all the contemporary books i might enjoy  the famous epic don quixote by cervantes known as the first modern novel is considered by many to be a mustread classic so i considered its about the time that i read it it was with some trepidation that i get into the book because of its length but i shouldnt have worried the short episodic chapters were easy and quick to read  don quixote is the story about the adventures of a man who calls himself don quixote de la mancha a selfproclaimed knight errant he is accompanied by his squire sancho panza the book contains two parts the second part is sort of a sequel to the first having been written after a period of ten years both books are written in the episodic style and describe the adventures of don quixote and sancho panza the adventures in the first part were so ridiculous that i found them humourous and highly entertaining the second part however takes a more serious tone although the adventures of don quixote and sancho panza were still touched with absurdity the first part i found to be more interesting and entertaining than the second although the themes of this book were fully expounded in the second part i enjoyed the lighthearted entertainment of the first part more the continuous monotony of the ludicrous conduct of don quixote kind of lost its charm towards the middle of part two and thereafter it was a mere drudgery i even lost focus on the final adventures  the themes presented here can be summed up in one quotation when life itself seems lunatic who knows where madness lies perhaps to be too practical is madness to surrender dreams  this may be madness too much sanity may be madness  and maddest of all to see life as it is and not as it should be from this we can see that cervantes working on the themes of reality and fantasy mad and sane and truth and lies and he is questioning where to draw the line between these opposing ends what is reality what is fantasy how to draw the line between these two ends what is madness is believing in the old ways madness or is denying the inevitable progress madness and what is truth and what are lies isnt the line between them blurred and isnt the drawing line our own perception how we see the difference these themes provide food for thought and there is also a good discussion on literary idealism and realism and cervantes seems to be advocating the latter  keeping my personal reading experiences aside i agree that this book is an important one especially in its day to influence a different style of literature so it is all but right to say that this pioneering modern novel is a mustread for those interested in classical literature don quixote by miguel de cervantes saavedra may be the beginning of slapstick  this is regarded as one of the greatest novels of all time and in a universal group it is very entertaining and even at times laugh out loud funny which is strange considering its age written around  a contemporary of shakespeares works  written in two parts the second written and published ten years after the first the second part more serious and is in a different style though perhaps more jocular the first part is inferior to the second perhaps cervantes had matured as a writer and had gotten better  still for a yearold novel it remains somewhat timeless a good book th book of  artist for this review is french painter honor daumier   don quixote rather famously stands as the first modern novel published in two parts the first in  and the second in  they are very different beasts the first part or book i is perhaps the don quixote people think of the thin mad spanish man alonso quixano who decides to become a knight errant and rename himself don quixote he manages to acquire a squire in the portly sancho panza and thus their adventures begin don quixote sees inns as castles ugly women as princesses your everyday vagabond as some great criminal   he is always attempting to exact some knightly behaviour on the unsuspecting and famously of course attacks windmills claiming they are giants on opening the novel at the beginning and starting to read i was stunned by the freshness of the prose thanks to grossmans translation whom i trust for her translations of gabo and the humour which i believed to be actually humorous the problem with the humour is though it never technically faulters don quixote is almost  pages long and so at times it feels as if it is the same gag running told over and over with slightly different twists and besides in the beginning we find don quixotes madness humorous and by even the midway point we start to find it endearing i wont go into all the possible interpretations of his madness as they are spoken about elsewhere by better speakers but for me quixotes unwavering desire to be a knight errant did strike me as being quite poignant when thought as simply as him staying true to what he believed in at one point after all don quixote says to a man let me conclude by saying seor that you should allow your son to walk the path to which his star calls him  description  book  for all its humour and chivalric tales of madness was slow reading to me don quixote feels long much longer than it actually is this derives mainly from the episodic nature of the first book and in part the second it is full of stories stories within stories tangents monologues   minor characters appear and when asked by don quixote who they are and what they are doing before he runs them through with his lance for no good reason they spin a long yarn about their life their love their failures and all the while we know as readers that this minor character will finish his spiel don quixote will realise that killing him because he is the devil or whoever else isnt so wise and let him go and down the same road another fellow will come along with a tale at times it had the stopstart feeling of a short story collection this presented a problem for me and damaged my experience of reading it i had heard book ii is considered different and by some better so that kept me reading through the longer and more uninteresting sideplots of the first book  description don quixote and sancho panza  and book ii is better the humour feels reinvigorated and theres a new angle to the already slight meta elements of the first part now in spain in reality there is a fraudulent don quixote book ii cervantes is returning to set the record straight it seems but he does so with wit and grace the characters in the novel are also aware of a fraudulent copy for i forget to mention the book is actually published within the story too and don quixote becomes famous in his own universe it reminded me somewhat of byrons poem a vision of judgement which is a satirical poetic smackdown of robert southeys own a vision of judgement from the year before cervantes not only mocks the fraudulent copy of his work but also mocks himself and addresses errors in book  which grossman helpfully points out at the time the misnaming of sancho panzas wife she has about  different names in book i the inconsistencies in the plot most notably the discussion of the disappearancetheft of sanchos donkey without it occurring in the plot quite meta so we then have stories within stories stories within stories again real stories in reality within the fictional story etc book ii is far more enjoyable than book i in my opinion and almost caused me to be magnanimous and give this stars but the truth is despite loving don quixote sancho panza and all the ridiculous things they got up to this novel is longwinded there are pages and pages that i didnt care for aside from the famous duo as far as the literary world goes this is perhaps a vital read and i am glad i finally read it despite the seemingly subpar rating ill be thinking about the pair for a long time about them vomiting on one another about them arguing about don quixote standing up to lions getting caught hanging from a window the two of them being tricked more times than there are pages about every bruised body broken tooth windmillgiant love for a lady one has never met sweeping th century spain with all its bandits priests prostitutes soldiers innkeepers dukes and duchesses   all its kaleidoscopic madness that has kept it surviving until today as one of the most translated book in the world and now i can refer to something as quixotic with good faith and intention and good memories of the beloved and most insane sane man to live don quixote  this was not the longest book ive ever read close though however it certainly felt like the longest book ive ever read the problem is not the length  the problem is that until the last some pages there is no continuous plot to keep you invested in the story everybody knows that this is the story of a crazy guy who decides to be a knight one day and he and his squire go on crazy adventures together and hilarity and tilting at windmills ensues what people might not know however is that theres no overarching quest no ultimate goal this book is over  pages of don quixote did this and then he did this and then he went here and this happened and then this person told a story and then they did this on and on and on its just dumb adventure after dumb adventure and theyre literally interchangeable  the timeline of the story doesnt matter at all  not that the stories are bad necessarily sure some of them are stupid and pointless and involving humor based on someone barfing or pooping and they tend to repeat themselves oh hey look another hot middle eastern chick who we only like because she converted to christianity but theyre usually funny at least but without an overall plot linking the stories together or giving them some significance nothing really matters speaking of which did anybody see sucker punch holy mother of god  throughout the whole book nobody ever learns anything or changes or even bothers to sit don quixote down and have a serious conversation about why he wants so badly to disappear into this fantasy life hes created for himself ultimately this is nothing more than a collection of funny anecdotes with some scatological humor and attempted swashbuckling thrown in  i said that nobody learns anything in the book but thats not technically true when don quixote finally comes home after all his adventures he gets sick and is dying its at this point that he has a revelation  that he was deluding himself with his dream of being a knighterrant and that it was all pointless and stupid fine but then he takes it a step further he decides that all the adventure books he read are the only thing to blame for this obsession and that they should be wiped from the face of the earth so no one else can be decieved by them he even writes his will to include the rule that if his niece wants to get married after his death the guy had better not have read even a single knighterrantry book or she doesnt get her inheritence  i dont know what were supposed to take away from that an adventure book that ends with the hero deciding that adventure books are evil and ruin peoples lives what the hell cervantes there were many laugh out loud moments in this book with the nonstop adventures of don quixote and sancho although at times it did feel like it was never going to end every time i sighed and couldnt believe they were getting into the same scrapes again the story took a twist with new characters and a short digression to keep me interested my feelings towards don quixote and sancho changed throughout and whereas i started out shaking my head about their idiocy by the end i had a slight suspicion that it was everyone else around them who was missing the point  i felt like the story could have stopped after the first book but i loved how cervantes addressed the reader directly in the second book dismissing another false story of don quixote by different author a real knights errant method of dealing with plagiarism my god this was a long book and when i told my boyfriend i was reading this he tried to tell me i should read das kapital with him as well which is almost twice this long like no thank you it was an okay book i definitely enjoyed it more than ive enjoyed other classics ive picked up it kind of reminded me of reading candide because it had that same sort of satirical tone sancho was pretty amusing through out the book and don quixotes adherence to his belief that he was a knight was something some parts were better than others and i think i

any of the classics ive read but i guess its nice to see where the influence is coming from for all the contemporary books i might enjoy god this was so long  there was a lot good about it but overall it just wasnt for me glad i read it as it will definitely come in handy in my literary studies as i go into my phd but it wasnt for me in slightly longer but still short an amusing and infamous first fifty pages with lots of hitormiss thereafter the second half gets dreadfully stale but has an interesting ending from a literary analysis standpoint  in long im using this review space as a journal for reading the incredible mountain of pages  day  here goes nothing here come  pages of translated text  the opening was insufferably cheeky and the origins of quixote are slower to unravel than a heroic anime still i see promise here and the reputation earns it a couple hundred pages before i pass a strong judgment  day  just finished chapter two couldnt help but notice the dope wearing illfitting armor his sidekick riding an ass and the party attacking wind mills all occurred within the first two chapters that about sums up the culturally famous parts of the novel making me wonder how many people in human history made it to page   day  passing through chapter three quixote is really growing on me despite cervantess narrative cervantes comes across as very bitter and far less clever in his very frequent literary and cultural criticisms making quixotes naive and insane positivity downright refreshing ill be interested to see if cervantes does anything with this but hes got me sympathizing with and heck downright rooting for the irresponsible senile knight  day  im told cervantes took up the hypercritical narrator to make a second point  beyond satirizing chivalry and parodying chivalric literature he wants me to sympathize with quixote that is a deep and admirable goal though im too thickheaded to have realized it on my own it would have been particularly hard to realize without help because the caustic narrative goes dormant so often and has been almost completely absent for fifty pages now  though its at least part because of my modern bias the bigoted references to africans and islam are bothering me  this book is quickly feeling like an anime turned into classic prose many of the chapters are completely unrelated and feel like filler episodes the main chapters are highly episodic most everything centers around a cast dealing with an interesting titular character and the cast is even growing in little spurts and contained revelations the way they do in anime if it wasnt for cervantess sense of humor being so similar to if more polite than geoffrey chaucers and the stuffiness of the writing id sooner put this one the anime dvd shelf than the classic book shelf  day  climbed through all of the impertinent curiosity today a threechapter digression that told another novel all on its own perhaps its in part due to the translation but this is insufferably overwritten with so much needless language and euphemism that i couldnt tell if cervantes intended homosexual innuendo in the first chapter and from then on had no idea when characters were supposed to have actual erotic or romantic attraction to anyone despite that the threechapter section is a great argument against picking apart the things you love lest you arent able to put them back together  day  im deep into book  the dialogue is sharper though still very dated a lot of the cleverness is executed more subtly and sancho thats the sidekick and quixote seem to actually expand as characters no they dont grow or change but dimensions are finally coming out of them a nice development some  pages in quixote is finally exiting that insufferable phase of senility where everything he does is stupid and the characters or narrator stand around to remind us how stupid it is hes actually getting things right now and then suggesting he must be more complex than the fool cervantess narrator often drew him to be he recognizes good poetry even though the narrator disagrees with his judgment is able to discuss philosophy with sound judgment and actually stands up to defend a case of real but forbidden love rather than say a delusion of two cucumbers that he thinks are lovers this makes him much more interpretable and interesting just as the stories in the picaresque are becoming more interesting as deception is used for more amiable ends than selfishness pride or greed deception is quickly replacing mistakes as the main theme  oh and the introduction to book  is interesting as it stands as a yearold example of metafiction with the characters discussing the reallife forged sequel to the original book and cervantess true work it also stands out as a yearold example of metafiction being insufferably cheeky how much the ancients predicted  day  the apocryphal chapter was tremendous don quixote visiting a holy site descending into it beyond anyones line of sight and falling asleep not getting knocked out not passing unconscious but cervantes specifically says he is asleep then he returns with a story of rich visions no one could improvise leaving us to wonder if he is lying if his delusion deepened in the cave or if quixote who has been developing to show more real intelligence lately really saw some of this cervantes is so preoccupied with slamming quixote that its easy to dismiss the possibility that quixote really experienced some of this but i think thats the easy way out hell even if cervantes did mean to make this the thousandth skeptical joke at quixotes expense i think id interpret it the other way just to give the text some depth  the prophetic ape was also amusing but after that the novel has spiraled down into the worst streak of thinlyveiled criticism sanchos bitching is insufferable the meeting with another knights party was similarly cloying all the cleverness is gone at this point in the book did we really need sancho to give us yet another monologue on how dumb his master is this better be a trick setting up some further development of quixote as semireliable or some other twist  day  i went out of town for a week and decided to leave this at home i took some shorter books with me instead couldnt put up with the awful redundancy and unhumorous comedy during what was supposed to be a vacation after a weeklong breather i find cervantess book  almost unbearable it seems that every new situation is quirky or curious in some way that feels not novel in the least after several hundred pages of other quirky and curious conflicts and the stories consist mostly of characters talking about how weird or difficult some part of them are in all the years ive had professors and writers praise this book to me ive never heard them mention any of this material leaving me to guess that even they never really finished the book sancho as a governor has a nice invertedsolomon quality about it when hes actually doing something in office but even most of his deliberations are considerably subpar satire for cervantes the highlight of todays reading was quixotes letter of advice and that only for the rare extremely quotable and thoughtprovoking lines such as be thou a father to the virtuous and a stepfather to the wicked  day  rounding the final bend here sancho and quixote are somehow back out on the road together again running into people who are alternately impressed or cynical towards quixotes wackiness they complain about the fake second book again quixote defends some womans honor through zany romanticism again was cervantes paid by the page the highlight by far is quixotes criticism of various saints going from bold to absurd the lowlight is the talking statue that shockingly is a fake  day  finally done cervantes really bore a grudge against the guy who wrote the fake quixote sequel but his last riffs against him wont spoil them were by far the funniest i imagine the last twenty pages are cause for more college essays than the preceding  but especially having read so much history and taking so much pains to learn how to earn an ending in fiction this came off entirely as a halfhearted copout that cervantes didnt mean to be the final word figuratively though obviously it is literally quixotes suddenly sane renounces everything he did and becomes bitter theres a good reason his company had no doubt whatever that some new craze had taken possession of him when life itself seems lunatic who knows where madness lies perhaps to be too practical is madness to surrender dreams  this may be madness too much sanity may be madness  and maddest of all to see life as it is and not as it should be i am probably stating the obvious when i make the comment that this book is a brick well not quite because it is actually two books in one  part  and part  part one deals with quixotes first two forays out into the world while the second book deals with his third honestly i didnt feel that this book really needed a second part but then again it appears that a lot of people were really wanting it to the point that a fake part ii was written and published something that cervantes riled against through out the second part honestly my initial thoughts on this book is that it is way too long and i found that in parts cervantes drifted so far off topic that my eyes literally began to glaze over one of my friends when we were reading this book for book club even suggested to not even bother with part two because well in his opinion it was just all background  well not quite but it certainly isnt the farcical romp that part one is in a way it is more perspective and the craziness of don quixote seems to not be all that important it seems that he and his squire sancho panza are actually having normal conversations and don quixote seems to be of quite a sound mind here which i feel completely undermines the premise in the first part of the book as for the first part it starts off really good but all of the sudden about halfway through it suddenly gets bogs down into narrative that really doesnt do much to help with the flow of the story  so we have this aging minor noble in the spanish region of la mancha who suddenly gets this idea that he will become a knight so he grabs an old suit of armour his horse and rides out to save a princess who happens to know nothing about what is going on and doesnt even realise that there is this knight running around wanting to save her and she doesnt actually need saving anyway don quixote gets so caught up in his fantasy that he sees a roadside inn as a castle the innkeeper as the lord of the castle and some wrenches as being noble ladies he also meets a number of characters on his two journeys and mistakes them for evil knights and wizards and then proceeds to get into fights that he promptly loses on his second journey he even grabs a poor farmer sancho panza as his page sancho being of sound mind decides to go along with quixote because well it happens to be better than his current situation the problem is that he ends up being the fall guy for many of quixotes adventures  for instance quixote has this belief that knights never have to pay for food and lodging because they never pay in any of the books that he has read however despite the fact that pretty much everybody tells him otherwise he remains convinced that knights dont have to pay for anything this is the problem with the second part because you have none of this and none of the mistaking a group of wandering friars as evil sorcerers who are holding a noble princess hostage further there is no comment about how quixote really doesnt need to be a knight because their land is at peace and when a land is a peace there are no need for knights  one interesting part of the book is about how a couple of quixotes neighbours  the curate and the butcher decide that it is necessary to cure quixote and proceed to raid his home looking for the cause of his delusion naturally they find a bunch of story books all dealing with knights and adventures well they decide that this is the problem and start throwing all of these books out except of course for the books that cervantes himself wrote because they could not have the effect that these other books have had this is an interesting idea because we see this happen time and time again back in the eighties there was a backlash against dungeons and dragons because well it uses so much of the imagination that there was the belief that people would become trapped in a fantasy world and of course start consorting with demons there is still the argument in play that violent games lead to violent tendencies and also create a disconnect where people are unable to distinguish the fantasy realm from reality i believe that is known as schizophrenia though im not entirely sure but i dont believe reading fantasy novels is the cause  yet the adventures that quixote goes on arent wonderful or glorious  by no means he gets pummelled beat up and left for dead at the side of the road a number of times sure at first the people he encounters simply run away but they are basically peasants an
Uncle Tom's Cabin,one readers confusion about why uncle tom means anything but hero   stars first i am glad i have finally read this book given its historical significance and the very positive impact that it had on american history that said from a literary perspective i didnt find this book to be particularly well written and am doubtful of whether it would be much remembered or considered a classic but for the aforementioned historical significance and the creation of the character of uncle tom more on that below the prose is not horrible but neither is it exceptional its just okay  since i assume everyone is familiar with the substance and background of the book i will not summarize it here others have done a much bettermjob of it however i do want to share an observation about the main character uncle tom that struck me pretty hard  prior to reading this book if you would have asked me about the character of uncle tom i would have said that he was a character portrayed as a weak willed slave who did everything he could to please his white master no matter what abuses were heaped upon him this opinion wrong as i now think it is would have been based in large part on the derogatory nature of the term uncle tom in the african american community as someone who has sold out their heritage and beliefs in order to be successful  after reading the book i dont think i can adequately express how strongly i disagree with that characterization i would place uncle tom among the pantheon of truly heroic figures in american literature granted tom was no hollywood squarejaw who armored up and went braveheart on the slave holders slaughtering them by the bushel however he was most definitely a hero in the mold of gandhi who never oncenever once compromised his principals and belief in non violence and tom changed those around him both white and black for the better  toms non violence came not from fear or cowardice but from his deeply held christian faith and his belief that he would rather suffer unjustly as christ did than raise a hand to another whether you agree with that philosophy or not it is beyond debate that to accept hardship rather than compromise your inner compass is called integrityits called courage  in one very memorable part of the book tom is ordered by his sadistic slave owner to whip a female slave tom refuses and is savagely beaten thereafter tom is repeatedly beaten because he continues to refuse to engage in conduct he finds reprehensible despite this repeated abuse tom never never backs down or compromises on his beliefs in fact the book goes on to describe the slave owners realization that while he may own toms body he could never acquire his soul folks for me that is a hero how many people would subject themselves to that kind of abuse rather than rationalize their principals  reading that portion of the book i was struck by the similarities between that scene and a speech given by gandhi in the movie with ben kingsley which i loved while speaking to a group of south africans about the need for non violent protest gandhi says i am paraphrasing somewhat this is a cause for which i am prepared to fight but my friends there is no cause for which i am prepared to killhowever fear not for we can not losethey can beat my body break my bones even kill methen they will have my dead body not my obedience  i found toms struggle to be very similar and the character of tom to be very heroic for that reason alone i bumped this up to  stars and highly recommend this book this book launched the civil war and at what cost in her novel uncle toms cabin harriet beecher stowe writes about the plight of enslaved individuals and she relies on religion to advance her argument that slavery should not exist the characters often appear as nothing more than archetypes stowes writing comes across as propaganda more times than not and yet the story of uncle toms cabin itself possesses an undeniable power a strength fueled by outright sentimentalism and moralist rhetoric  i wrote about ten pages of analysis of this book for my social protest literature class during that time i could not help but compare it to the dove real beauty campaign dove promotes body positivity and at the same it overemphasizes the role of beauty and discounts a lot of diversity stowe opposes slavery and she also includes sentiments of romantic racism and overt christian bias in her book if you read uncle toms cabin i would recommend approaching it from a critical lens it did a lot to progress racial equality while still enforcing a slew of problematic ideas we still see in todays discussions of race  overall an important book in our nations history and one i would encourage people to read if they possess an interest in the institution of slavery or social protest literature in general not the most eloquent book ever written but revolution does not always require a lot of eloquence as evidenced by this story and many others ok so i was supposed to read this in my high school ap class i think my friend and i may even have taken turns reading parts of it but it never really happened but this last semester i actually read it twice because thats what my amer romanticism professor suggested we do and to be honest i was kind of scared of him for a while  but heres the deal it really isnt a great book it started out as bed time tales for her kids progressed to installments in a magazine and then eventually became a famously historical book that having been said here are the things i find interesting   the idea of stayathome feminism notice that stowe while she empowers women in many ways that were uncommon among her contemporaries she still places women within their sphere and it is the women who are successful within their sphere caring for the children and husband making sure the kitchen is neat and orderly even if they dont actually do the cooking having a well run household etcthat are good these are the women who succed in life the other women well they tend to be the characters we hate also interesting the female characters in this book have an uncanny resemblance to the female characters in toni morrisons beloved i could write a lot about this i did a paper on it but i would love to know if anybody else sees the same similarities i do besides this one crazy woman who wrote an article saying beloved was a rewrite of uncle toms cabin i really didnt buy her argument at all and i would hate to think shes the only one who agrees with me   uncle tom as christ   the unrelentingly christian aspect of the novel either youre christian and good or not christian and bad or you are struggling between the two and trying to attain the title of christian oh and that the best christians are really the slaves because they are more childlike and vulnerable therefore closer to jesus let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those authorities that exist have been instituted by god romans   is there a god to trust in o ive seen things all my life that have made me feel that there cant be a god you christians dont know how these things look to us theres a god for you but is there any for us utc chapter   harriet beecher stowe b   d  was a white christian abolitionist her seminal masterpiece uncle toms cabin pub  inarguably stoked the flames of black liberation in nineteenth century america and all points abroad  utc is a compelling call to arms of the christian left it is a hard and often painful read both because it exposes the barbaric cruelty of institutionalized slavery and because it proposes to give an omnipotent entity all of the credit for freedom and absolutely none of the blame for subjugation  stowe at once petitions the largely silent pious majority while also shaking a proverbial fist at godless atheists acquiescent clergymen kowtowing politicians and even venture capitalists her fictional characters are firmly rooted in the reality of her time and are nearperfectly positioned to educate the ignorant and light a fire under the indifferent even president abraham lincoln allegedly credited her with putting the wheels of emancipation in motion  i teeter between three and four stars for uncle toms cabin stowe is certainly not unique in mistakenly superimposing piety over morality and the abominable events of which she writes are sadly but mercifully understated but her narrative as it progresses becomes decreasingly about the abolition of the slavestate and more about the establishment of the religiousstate her agenda is obvious enough to give me pause even if her other inclinations are commendable  christian left an extinct species of believers that largely embraced centerleft and leftwing sociopolitical policies of human decency and racial equality the last known example died in captivity in palm beach florida on the th day of november  im torn on what to rate this book if i was to rate it based purely on its antislavery message itd be a  star book if i was to rate it on story maybe  stars characters would be a  writing quality would be a  and tangential preaching would be a   but all of that combined im not sure i get an average of about  from all of those factors but i just didnt like reading it enough to rate it a  star book theres no doubt its important and influential and a classic and i am glad that i read it but enjoyment is a big factor for me and this was just so tedious to read it was like reading a lecture now children gather round so i can tell you why slavery is bad and religion is the only answer to everything in as many words as possible  it also seemed like stowe didnt know when to let her story speak for itself this was a big big irritation for me and it manifested in a couple different ways first was the interruption of the story with the omniscient narrator jumping in to speak directly to the reader i really despise that if the book isnt always written in that method like say the book thief was then its just annoying and distracting when it pops up in normal narration it is ok to have a chapter take us into a different storyline when needed or flashback or whatever the case may be without saying in order to understand this reader one must look to his past urgh its patronizing and obnoxious im intelligent enough to follow a shift in the story secondly and also this book was repetitively repetitive and furthermore repeated points quite often while making the point again and again using the methods of redundancy restatement and just plain saying that shit one more time for good measure just in case the reader didnt quite get it the first  times finally the religious browbeating oh my goodness i have nothing against religion or faith and have no problem with characters who are religious however fervent if its the character its the character and thats that but this book was so preachy i started just skimming anytime i saw god the lord him faith bible etc etc etc after half of this book it just starts over again with the message christianity is everything faith in jesus is the only thing that makes a human a person worthy of anything at all or capable of any intelligence or moral reasoning etc etc etc  im not a religious person so this struck an irritating chord with me like i said i have no issue with anyones religion or faith and i feel like they have every right to believe whatever they like but i do kind of take offense to the insinuation that a persons worth is derived from being able to name themselves a christian slavery uses the color of a persons skin essentially to determine their worth i just think that a person should be judged as a person not whether they believe in a certain supreme being or whether they have darker skin than someone else thats just one of my pet peeves i dislike being preached to dislike being made to feel like im not a whole person because i dont follow a particular faith and this book rubbed me the wrong way for that reason sigh  on the other hand i loved tom for his stoicism and faith and perseverance and calm acceptance in the face of everything i loved that he stood for what he believed in and wanted to better himself and those around him his way was to do that through faith and lacking any other means i think it was commendable i do have to say though i am at a loss to understand why slaves would so unwaveringly continue to have faith in a system that only served to keep them down i do not understand that but i respect the faith and courage it would take to keep up against all odds tom is definitely a character that while maybe a little too perfect is definitely a hero  im sure that when this was written it was a real eyeopener its kind of appalling to me the attitudes that people held in regard to black people that they were less than human incapable of feeling or emotion tiredness other than just laziness and laxity loneliness or pain honestly im so thankful i dont live in an age where that kind of thinking is the norm i like to think id be like eva and see everyone as a person an equal  anyway im giving this  stars the writing and story left a bit to be desired and was contrived for maximum impact but i guess thats to be expected with this kind of story its not always an enjoyable read and is a bit tedious at times but it is one that i think everyone should read at some point in their lives if only to see what true courage is after reading a quote said by abraham lincoln to the author of this book i was curious to know more about her and her work and finally i managed to start uncle toms cabin  the book was difficult read it took much longer than i expected to finish i had to reread entire conversations often to understand what was being said  the pace of the novel is quite slow the plot melodramatic with characters which demand your sympathy i cant even imagine what it would be like to be a slave bought and sold like a piece of meat the people in this novel be it uncle tom eva or elza they leave a mark on you so that you will remember them always  after reading several reviews and discussion forums i noticed that many have criticised that if this novel wasnt about the slavery it would have made a very average book but that could be said about many books in the end what matters is this book helped bring a great change in society it helped to correct a great wrong which had been done to an entire race how many writers have the privilege to claim that  it has strange and interesting characters a man who hates the southern slavers but is forced to sell his slaves to him a man who treats black people properly but doesnt mind slavery his cousin who hates slavery but finds black people inferior to her the novel forked in two ways two slaves who chose different paths when faced with the same problem it is not for us to criticise their actions we who have never had our freedom denied we who sit in our comfortable homes surrounded by our loved ones we who have no idea what it meant to be a slave in those times in that place  the novel ended on a sad note with a hint of hope i expected no less when the lives of these men were such a misery how can a book about them have a happy ending  a real difficult book to read but im glad i read it this is one of those classics that was so hyped up that when i finally read it i was pretty underwhelmed not to say that its not an impactful story but its just far more tame and reflective than i thought it would be i think if i hadnt already read roots by alex haley i would be greatly impressed by this book as it stands i was too aware of the fact that it was a white woman telling an african american slaves tale to a predominantly white audience hbs delivers a great but sad story into the lives of tom and his family and how they migrate away from down south to canada the writing style was true to the time period which made it a bit difficult to understand but otherwise a good read we visited the museum of the confederacy in charlston south carolina and there was a display of about  novels written as southern responses to the publication and wild success of uncle toms cabin in the north that made me want to read uncle toms cabin to see why it was so popular it has several good narrative lines and the evilest of characters simon legree a name i have heard of many time but did not know the origin of it also did a comprehensive job of demonstrating how slavery bound blacks to pitiful circumstances in which hard honesty education and ambition were fruitless through the depiction of the slave owning characters the author develops the view that slaveowning had much the same effect on them as they were lazy illogical and ultimately retained the system of slavery through greed sloth and lack of imaginationhow else could they live their lives   but as a novel it was only so so quite moralistic no surprise and melodramatic but i think books in the th century were more typically that way than modern novels so it probably seemed quite a standard sort of story telling  certainly this is worth a read but it is very long and has pages and pages of dialogue debating the merits of slavery these can slogged through but at quite a large cost to ones overall enjoyment of the book  now i want to read one of the southern responses but am not sure which one to choose maybe i will call the museum of the confederacy and see if they hav e a recommendation and if not just ask for any title at all i will post on that when i get through it while i know this to be an important novel i do not necessarily consider it to be a great reading experience i do not regret reading it  reading a classic always provides me with a new knowledge a new perspective on things and uncle toms cabin is undoubtedly a book that holds an important message about a time when things were very different from today  like louisa may alcott i cannot help but to admire harriet beecher stowe for her bravery her sharp sense of justice and her deep faith in humanity sadly i do not admire her writing style in fact i almost couldnt stand it stowe tends to be very preachy her christianity is impossible to escape it is very explicit and it is almost unendurable to a modern reader like myself while i can forgive alcott for her constant morality i cannot forgive stowe for her religious preaching  however i did like a lot of the characters in this book i had not expected to like uncle tom but i found him to be extremely brave and enormously inspiring he does not break down he sticks to his beliefs and while he doesnt take an active part in a uproar he embodies a silent protest it is easy to confuse his heroism with weakness  but in fact his weakness is a defense of his right to remain human it must have been very provocative when it was written i am glad people were reading it back then but i feel that it is not antiracist enough for this era i am not sure it is highschool material especially for nonusa kids that are not familiar with the subject of slavery i think it might create the opposite effect of the desired one by emphasizing that there are inherent differences between races i liked uncle toms cabin the parts with eliza and her family made an especially good story however the book is most interesting as a very effective polemic and for its place in history and culture for pure reading enjoyment there is a bit too much of the author obtrusively present in places speaking directly to the reader and a bit too much debate philosophizing and obvious exposition of slavery in the mids us south the discussion of values gets in the way of the pure story christianity plays a prominent role in the book harriet beecher stowe was a ministers daughter and uncle tom is a devout and devoted follower of jesus the narration by mirron willis of the blackstone audio cd is very good at first english is not my native language so if any expressions are wrongoffending or just sound like that maybe i used them wrong please tell me so  after reading this i feel kinda conflicting about it  i wanted to read this book this book because i considered it as a mustread taking into account the historical background of it or the advanced way she handled the at her times even more difficult subject  i liked the story really it was a nice story with nice harmless however sometimes a little bit onedimensonial main characters one could raise sympathy for however i got the feeling that this sympathy has nothing to do with the authors good work but rather with the fact that one must feel compassion for slaves and any human being automatically suffers with them since particularly it was not described well i had my biggest problem probably with her writing style therefore i couldnt rate the book with five stars it was just dull boring writing anyone couldve come up with in my opinion at some points its even a bit too melodramatic the whole story couldve been told way better i also had my problems with the christianic subjects that are showed throughout the whole novel anyone can relate to them and anyone is able to understand them the concept of compassion was in my opinion not founded by christians and it should be a principle approved everywhere that one does not hurt person and makes enslaves another human being a community that lives with each otherin respect and harmony it is not only a christian subject and it sometimes seemed to me maybe because harriet beecher stowe herself was a pastors daughter that everything was lowered to christian values although these are the moral principles which are effective all over the world maybe i am simply too religiouscritical in this sense and was irritated after a while by the bible quotations and swollen speeches of the main protagonistsim sorry if anyone is offended by that its just my personal opinion i also thought some other characters handled the slaves waaaay too nice and were all good christians who would never hit a slave and who cared for them without even being a little bit racist i mean come on at that time hidden racism was a normal thing and i thought they all seemed way too advanced in time and attitude as they were only villagers  to conclude the story is exciting from the first page on but with average writing and flat characters but given the historical context i still think it is worth the read just to imagine some circumstances better the first exposure i ever had to this story was the musical number within the movie the king and i  you can obviously tell that this isnt a modern book by any standards although the best selling novel of the th century and the second bestselling book after the bible it is completely dated some say even offensive for the stereotypes that it helped to create  i say that when youre reading a book that was published in a different era you need to take into consideration the mindset of the readers of that time the word nigga appears many many times in this book and its meant to be derogatory but youll notice that none of the characters flinch at the word because its commonplace in that century i can imagine harriet beecher stowe sitting at her desk and writing this all out and never thinking twice about the word choices she makes  it was an interesting read certainly not something i would have ever picked up from a store but we had it lying in our living room and id packed all my other books  i think i would have enjoyed the story more had there been more to it uncle toms cabin is a very actiondialogue based story and im not surprised because it was initially published as a serial so the chapters have almost a recap and bounce back and forth as you recall we left so and so even though i had just read that only two chapters ago its a little choppy in that respect but you still have to keep in mind of when it was published and why hmmmi love classics but i only liked this one it was well not exciting and i found the characters except eva to be a bit flat the only thing that saved this book for me i think is that i listened to it and the narrator richard allen made it come somewhat alive  i did like to see what our history was like back in the s when this was written though it is fiction it brings out many viewpoints of the times there are always good and bad and there are always the complainers and the people that try to change the world in their own way eva uncle tom topsy in the end the story talks about integrity being who you really are and treating others as you want to be treated  perhaps i have been hardened from the events of today or then several books ive read about wwii recently im not sure but this book didnt hit the emotions that it seemed to hit for others i suspect this isnt a popular view but it is mine and to each their own this was assigned reading for an american history course i took at stanford a long time ago its an important historical totem but the book itself is very saccharine and a slog to read i did learn that the doormat scripturequoting uncle tom was an apt symbol for the black panthers as a passive black person who lets himself get shoved around by mean white people  such a very moving story my only trouble was that there were areas that got dragged out and boring i definitely had moments where i zoned out although i listened to this on audiobook with my cousin and her pre teen kids so maybe that was the issue regardless this is a very moving and important story i think its a book that every one should read at least once in their life a very wellwritten and emotional denunciation of american slavery it is clear why this book had such a profound impact on the cause of abolition  in part stowe emphasizes the evils of slavery by contrasting the humanity of the slaves to the despicable disregard of that humanity by the slave traders some of the language used and scenes depicted are quite shocking potential readers should be aware of that before deciding to read this novel the other tool used by stowe which seemed to me at least as powerful was the depiction of characters sympathetic to the slaves plight these are the characters who though they find the institution of slavery unpalatable do nothing about it it is to these people who through their inaction grant tacit approval to the slave trade that stowe places a burden of responsibility at least that of the plantation owners i find that its these characters that anchor this novel to the present the same kind of passive acceptance still plagues social and political issues today  my two main criticisms of the novel are the racial stereotypes and the heavyhanded christian themes the first is a welldocumented issue and i believe to be an unfortunate consequence of the racial science and politics of the time there is a very bitter irony that the novel which promoted abolition also sowed the seeds of several persistent racial stereotypes as for the christian imagery and allusion which frequented the latter parts of the novel it was just a bit much often i found scenes which by themselves would have been very powerful left cheapened by overpowering christian theology also the variety of scenes where miserable people suddenly found respite in the promises of new testament scripture seemed more like cheesy christian prosthelytizing than scenes i should be taking seriously in a mansion in kentucky a transaction is carried out between a slave trader and the master of the house mr shelby shelby is not a bad man just not infallibleand so deep in debt that the trader who now holds all of shelbys debts can dictate terms he asks not for all of shelbys property which of course includes all his slaves as much possessions as the furniture in shelbys house but for two slaves the pride and joy of the shelby household and estate one is the loyal hardworking and pious tom who manages the estate the other is a little boy bright and clever and handsome son of a quadroon woman named eliza whom mrs shelby has brought up and educated and nurtured as a daughter  thus starts harriet beecher stowes classic antislavery novel uncle toms cabin in a comfortable privileged setting where the presence of slavery appears at first to be not quite so horrifying there is happiness comfort even conviviality in the warmth of tom and his wife aunt chloe in the ease with which mr shelbys son george teaches tom to read in mrs shelbys love for eliza and her child  but the transaction is revealed and while toms gentleness forces him to submit uncomplainingly eliza knows that once separated from her child she is unlikely to ever see him again so she escapes racing for canada where her husband has fled too a brief while earlier from a brutal master  the book moves between these principal characters even though the main protagonist remains tom and follows their adventures as tom is taken to new orleans and finds himself sold to a genial young man augustine st clare whose little daughter eva is the very personification of sweetness and light as tragedy strikes and tom ends up in one of the dreaded cotton plantations of the south  there are several things about this book that make it the classic that it is first and foremost is mrs stowes obvious and fervent belief in the wrongs of slavery which is what lends so much conviction to her writing she doesnt pull punches when it comes to revealing the atrocities inflicted on slaves this is done through a large cast of characters all of whom bring in some aspect or the other of just what it meant to be a slave even if outwardly one seemed to be pampered as st clares selfcentred hypochondriac of a wife would have put it  of these characters two in particular stood out for me as complex and intriguing st clare who while a man with a conscience and a man who sees the evil in slavery can only bring himself to make sure his slaves are treated well no more a man who is too lazy too lacking in pragmatism to do any more and closer to the end of the book the brilliantly ballsy cassy bitter and angry but using that anger to fuel her own ambition to save herself and another  as for the rest of the characters most are painted too black the planter simon legree is a prime example or too white little eva whom i found nauseatingly saintly there are relatively few who are shades of grey and theylike st clare his cousin ophelia or cassyare the most interesting  despite the good intentions though some elements of the book riled me for instance there are many instances of africans being stereotypedthe jovial motherly mammy the entertaining piccaninny the beautiful young woman often a quadroon the brute who will surpass his master in tormenting his fellow slaves the longsuffering bibledependent uncle tom theyre all there and in ample doses  and there are mrs stowes own words which are often downright condescending or reek of generalizations tom is a noblehearted faithful fellow if he is black the african naturally patient timid and unenterprising or the references to africans being sensitive impressible and a susceptible race  one last word of caution theres a lot of emphasis on christianity and christian feeling here which is probably in some ways indicative of the times but even to me lm a christian this got a bit tedious at times  still all said and done a book that does leave an impression no wonder it helped fuel the cause of abolition this is perhaps the most famous and convincing example of a book that is capable of shutting down lovers of great literature and locking up all their arguments in a bulletproof safe orwells comment about it being a paragon of a good bad book is absolutely spoton no one could possibly dismiss the fact that it made such an impact for perfectly good reasons not only does it do a superb job at exposing the truth and stirring up the necessary emotional reactions it possesses several key components of literary experience that the cloyingly sentimental style and flat characters too often hide it has interesting archetypal connections the most effective part for me is the final section with tom cassy and legree as types of moses the israelites and the pagans passages of truly inspired writing and stowe truly does dig beneath the superficiality of the critique that she could easily have made to uncover the core challenges and paradoxes of how the country viewed slavery and its relationship to socialreligious mores of course i came close to crying toward the end and if you dont then you should be ashamed of yourself yet too often it is difficult to determine if stowe wields her sentimentality as a handy mask for her more noble writing or whether her skills truly didnt extend much further than the aboveaverage pamphleteering purveyor of popular fiction that she possibly was sto
Qur'an,this book was one of the most amazing books that i have ever read it changed my whole perspective on the muslim people  i had a very positive view of the muslim people and their beliefs after

even offensive one must really imagine life a very long time ago before there there was computers and silly puddy if you only ever in your entire life read one book read this one i promise you it is unlike anything else youll ever read this is awkward well im a muslim therefore i will find this the best book in the history of civilization   god is merciful  most merciful the king the peace the dominant the mighty the creator  god has a beautiful names as a whole is not unknown is one lord for christians and muslims and buddhists and brahma and ancient pharaohs all sanctified god and as muslims we do not have a problem if the christians wrote that god is the author of the bible to the contrary and if they did not wrote it we will wrote   so do not claim that there is religious conflict here   its the problem of nonbelievers in god  their problem stands in the lack of respect for the beliefs of others and in the lack of respect for freedom of belief and the faith  the quran is the main religious text of islam muslims believe that it was revealed to the prophet muhammad  years ago by god it is considered the book of guidance for humankind  the quran was revealed in the month of ramadan on the night of laylatul qadr night of decree it is considered that completing this greatest literary masterpiece in arabic during ramadan brings an abundance of rewards i am delighted as i was able to finish reading it during this ramadan  i think that this is a book that people from every religion and culture should read the amount of wisdom in it is remarkable the holy quran is a book that everyone should read no matter the religion but it should be read in its original language like most books that are translated it loses flavor when its notthe arabic language when read has many different meanings and when translated it loses thoseso u get one verse that means one thing when actually it has  or  different meanings does that make senseas much as i read the quran i learn something new every time and im happy to say it does not teach hate or violence like most people think it doeshaving come from a family that doesnt speak nor understand proper arabic very well i studied the quran slowly and got a quran translator which is just as long as the quran maybe longer translating very verse for me and helping me understand it in my own weird version of arabicso to end my review i recommend you read the quran in its original text and get a quran translator preferable al safee fe tafser ilquran which is really known and respected by everyone say can the blind be held equal to the seeing will ye then consider not  enam   quran means recitation in arabic  muslims recite the whole book once during the month of ramazan this is happenning since  years now some people recite this once everyday some once every week it has  chapters sura this book is in arabic language  quran is a big ocean amateurs like me make mistakes with such a big subject but i think it is better to be imperfect and full of mistakes than be perfect and all alone  i will only describe the physical aspects of quran in this review i wont go into spiritual details of this book there is a big wide spiritual world too  quran as we all know was written by hand during the prophet mohammed pubh time on crude paper and animal skins when rd caliph usman ghani ra saw people reading quran in their local syrian iraqi and other dialects he made a public address that quran must be recited in the dialect of mohammed pubh the dialect of koresh tribe of mecca this wise order had far reaching uniting effect on the muslims into one body no matter what geographical region muslim came from he became united with other muslims in recitation of quran the guide book    who wrote quran then  muhammad h years ago at his age  saw an angel asking him to read he said i am not literate i cant read and write the angel pressed him to his chest and said repeat after me    read in the name of my lord who made everythingmade human from a leech like shaperead your lord is kindwho taught with pentaught man what he knew not   this is how  chapters completed muhammad memorized the recitation and his friends memorized all taught by muhammad quran means recitation in arabic    usman ghani ra called all huffaz memorizers in town of medina yatrib of old and asked the commettee to write quran in order of sura chapters into a book form before this people used to call quran papers sahifa parchmentspapers a book made during his time is still present in topakapi museum of istanbul  i am writing this review for general audience muslims will find this review very simple but if we break down all matter into small pirmal units things are simple in nature the biggest wonder of quran is billions of people have recited it many are reciting it now many are engaged in memorizing it not one time any of these good folks said a wrong thing about language or meanings of quran  many billions of learned people has written tomes of explainations of each and every verse of this wonderful book many are writing about it today many will keep writing about it the quranic written words are so powerful and beautiful in melody they make you shudder they compel you to think they reason with you and plead you to consider again and again this book covers all subjects of human existance it only needs to be interpreted in proper way to go into real depths of meanings imagine the volume of brains exhausted in absorbing this miraculous book  this book has  chapters each chapter has a given name to it every chapter has verses some chapters has  verses some has  verses and some has  verses i will give you a few names of chapters fatiha the opening this is the first chapter in quran let me give you the feel of its words and wonderful meanings in it for your sampling  no number of stars are enough to rate this beautiful beautiful divinely beautiful book first of all i should point out that im a westerner and a nonbeliever what does it mean to be a westerner to be a person who believes andor is aware of the intellectual tradition from the ancient greeks through europe to end in the americas this means among others things that i live in a society that for centuries looked up only to european ideologies which for centuries tried and succeeded to erase the dignity and history of others nations of the world  ive been reading the koran at night many nights too i listened to the recitation by mishary alafasy at my balcony naturally i dont understand arabic i just wanted to listen the intonation and vibration the beautiful voice of that man alafasy who makes his living in a most honorable way spreading with passion what he believes in although im a nonbeliever i try to see and sense beauty everywhere everyday if i call both the koran and the recitation beautiful please i mean no disrespect i know people who believe and live by it dont consider it literature nor they consider it an object of mere beauty its just that is one of the ways i approached it i enjoyed reading it i enjoyed listening to it i try not to consider the koran literature or poetry either i urgently want to respect what millions of people believe in it was hegel who wrote somewhere that art religion and philosophy are the highest works and manifestations of the human spirit i approached the koran in the same mood  why should a nonbeliever read the koran today i think of it as an ethic obligation to try to understand what other people believe in but most important of all try to understand what other people call just and fair islam is the last of the monotheist religions jews faced holocaust and developed zionism christians of all sorts faced the shame of being represented by the spanish inquisition and by the genocide of the aboriginal nations of the americas islam too is going through dark ages unspeakable acts are being done supposedly in the name of the prophet pbuh  trying to understand is sort of a desperate act trying to understand each other and the situation we live in is the only way but beware to understand what is the seed and origin of racism of fanaticism of islamophobia and antisemitism you need to visit more than one source you too are a seed nurture yourself from many sources with respect my favorite book the book i read almost everyday and it still astonishes me touches me nourishes me and surprises me it makes me think it helps me when im down sick or tired it makes me happier lighter and a better person it makes me grateful for being born a muslim and a word lover without a doubt one of allahs best gifts to us humans  if youre here because you want reasons to hate muslims or islam or to love muslims or islam the exit is to your right  also im not rating the quran which is idiotic but the edition which is wonderful id never considered reading the thing until a friend of mine gave a little workshop on teaching bits of it then another friend said this was a really good edition and behold it is haleem gives you just enough historical and linguistic information to let you read and interpret more or less on your own no doubt his interpretationtranslation has a liberal bias but lets be honest why bother trying to read an edition by someone whose main interest in one of the worlds greatest religious texts is how it can help them justify their atavistic tendency to beat women behead people or murder journalists  as for my experience reading the quran i started reading it at the same time i watched the first season of homeland which despite some unreconstructed postcolonialist discussion to the contrary is quite sympathetic to a islam and b terrorists watching brodies conversion while reading the first few suras made me think more or less i can see the attraction here and although all the ingrained theological philosophical and historical barriers to taking the book quite that seriously returned pretty quickly to my mind the feeling was memorable enough that i kept on reading  unlike the jewish and christian bibles the quran looks a bit like a modernist literary experimenters idea of a sacred text its impossible to read either bible and think its the word of god for the very good reason that god is a character and if theres a god she is by definition not such a douchebag as to talk about himherself in the third person but the style of the quran is unified and you never lose sight of the fact that this is structurally at least god using gabriel to talk to mohammed about by and and large everyday matters of social and religious organization the experimental feel comes from the texts willingness to switch without notice between first second and third person perspectives which haleem handles very well theres nothing like these jumps in all the worlds literature as far as i know  the themes of the text are also clear whereas the bibles really dont seem to have any unifying themes at all  i muhammad is the latest and last in a line of prophets stretching back to abraham all of them were rejected by their people in some way ii god took vengeance on those who rejected the prophet and will take vengeance on the idolators who threaten the muslim communities of the time iii the rules for being saved are very simple and gods pretty laid back about most things you shouldnt eat meat sacrificed to idols but on the other hand you can eat such meat if youre really hungry iv compared to the idols living around the muslims god is a very mild ruler compared to their social customs muslim social customs are equally mild this is not to say that those customs and rules are mild compared to ours v at the end of time god will separate out the believersgood people from the unbelieversevil doers evil doing mostly consists in being cruel or vicious towards the poor and unfortunate eg if youre mean to orphans or use your wealth for yourself rather than others youve going into the fire  all that said it can get dull for the unbeliever at times these themes are unified but also stated over and over again given that the original point of the suras was gods explaining through the prophet something important for the specific historical moment at which the revelation was made thats hardly surprising but provided you know biblical stories which the quran refunctions in all sorts of ways you should be able to read this and you should its a marvel    passages i found particularly interesting or poetic please note i only started marking them with sura  about a quarter of the way through believe it or not ive actually cut down on the apocalyptic things that i liked if you only look at one or two check out the last three which are astonishingly beautiful  know that god comes between a man and his heart on the day we gather them all together we shall say to those who associate partners with god stay in your place you and your partnergods their partnergods will say it was not us you worshipped we had not idea that you worshipped us we have bound each human beings destiny to his neck on the day of resurrection we shall bring out a record for each of them which they will find spread wide open read your record today your own soul is enough to calculate your account when the trumpet is sounded and we gather the sinful sightless they will murmur to one another you stayed only ten days we know best what they say but the more perceptive of them will say your stay on earth was only a single day if all the trees on earth were pens and all the seas with seven more seas besides were ink still gods words would not run out god is almighty and all wise creating and resurrecting all of you is only like creating or resurrecting a single soul we offered the trust to the heavens the earth and the mountains yet they refused to undertake it and were afraid of it mankind undertook itthey have always been very inept and rash and we subjected the wind for solomon its outward journey took a month and its return journey likewise some of the jinn worked under his control with his lords permission they made him whatever he wanted then when we decreed solomons death nothing showed the jinn he was dead but a creature of the earth eating at his stick when he fell down they realizedif they had known what was hidden they would not have continued their demeaning labor wtf  on the day when gods enemies are gathered up for the fire and driven onward their ears eyes and skins will when they reach it testify against them for their misdeeds they will turn to their skins why did you testify against us all of sura  but anyone who is given his record in his left hand will say if only i had never been given any record and knew nothing of my reckoning my wealth has been no use to me and my power has vanished take him put a collar on him lead him to burn in the blazing fire he would not believe in almighty god he never encouraged feeding the destitute so today he has no real friend here and the only food he has is the filth that only sinners eat prophet do not rush your tongue in an attempt to hasten your memorization of the revelation it is for us to make sure of its safe collection and recitation muhammad was worried he couldnt remember it all god tells him itll be okay cute he frowned and turned away when the blind man came to him muhammad turns away from a believer to try to convert others and is chastised by god man is such that when his lord tries him through honour and blessings he says my lord has honoured me but when he tries him through the restriction of provision he says my lord has humiliated me no indeed you people do not honour orphans you don not urge one another to feed the poor and you love wealth with a passion what will explain to you what the steep path is it is to free a slave to feed at a time of hunger an orphaned relative or a poor person in distress and to be one of those who believe and urge one another to steadfastness and compassion  by the fading day man is deep in loss except for those who believe do good deeds urge one another to truth and urge one another to steadfastness  say i seek refuge with the lord of daybreak against the harm of what he has created the harm of the night when darkness gathers the harm of witches when they blow on knots the harm of the envier when he envies initially before reverting to islam i was reading an english translation of the quran that i struggled to make sense of on the day i took my shahada mustafa khattab gave me a copy of the clear quran as a welcoming gift taking my shahada was the moment i began my life as a muslim but the clear quran has been teaching me the path to allah since that moment the clarity in the writing allows the beauty of the quran and islam to be conveyed in a way that inspires me to change my life and be a better person i truly believe that the precision and accuracy in the translation of the clear quran also has the ability to show nonmuslims the real beauty of islam and the quran the clear quran is an important tool for creating peace between muslims and nonmuslims that we need to utilize as for the four scholars who edited and revised this translation i know two of them only dr v abdurrahim who is indian and dr fazal ilahi zaheer who is pakistani  therefore i do not see how it can be labelled a saudi translation official or otherwise they werent even the first to print it it was first published in  in chicago  darcy wrote yawn this was given to me by a cleric when i was living in riyadh free for all nonmuslims i still have the copy but havent cracked it in  years like most religious texts it only makes sense if youre either indoctrinated already or in seeker mode made it about half way and skimmed the rest  most nonsaudi muslims would agree that saudi arabian islam has a messed up take when it comes to interpretation wahhabism is a direct result of that interpretation and spawned osama the taliban and has somehow justified banning music and throwing acid in womens faces for reading pretty sure that wasnt gods intention their translation should be taken lightly though it is the one used in maddrassas across central asia so not too lightly its amazing how different the translations can be the koran is a tough nut to crack peoples eyes well up with tears when they talk about it but i guess it didnt touch me that way there are so many sutras that could be taken this way or that way its no surprise that there are so many definitions of what beliefs make someone muslim and that so many are willing to kill over it  thanks for even accepting it actually its free for both muslims and nonmuslims alike i agree that this translation has some problems especially those cumbersome brackets with commentaries spoiling the natural flow  however i do not think it is correct to say that it is a saudi arabian interpretation see reply to lisa above  regarding the prohibition of music that was unanimously agreed upon by all four schools of islamic law long before any saudis came along  as for barbaric acts like throwing acid on any living being that is not something espoused by the scholars of islam regardless of which interpretation they might follow surely there are extremists and ignorant people in islam too just as in every other group and religion have we forgotten the christian witchhunters and womenburners of europes dark ages  sutras means covers or screens and perhaps what you actually meant is soorahs or chapters of the quraan  i hope sometime you find the opportunity to openmindedly read any translation of the meanings of the quraan and yes in seekermode  following the evidence wherever it leads  you might just see then that there are really only two beliefs that make one a muslim no one but god has the right to be worshipped and that muhammad is his messenger everything else in islam is based upon these two foundations  also im sure you are aware that the many willing to kill over it im not sure what are actually a negligible minority compared to the mainstream therefore i hope you adopt fairness and do not continue to blame the religion for the misdeeds of this tiny band of outcasts it is the only book in the whole history that at any moment for the last  years you will find thousands to millions of people memorising it and applying it in daily life  in  it is estimated that over  million muslims allover the world are memorising it and can recite it without a need for a papar book i am always surprised how is this possible it is a book of life  i advice all muslims and non muslims to read it you all will be surprised even if i review it just as any other book every book has a life but this one is the timeless classic piece of wisdom which is here for more than  years and still loved and cherished by the the believers and non believers from the very first manuscript till date just one edition and it will remain the same till the domes day may allah give us the opportunity to learn from this manual of life from the creator himself i cannot express how much this book has done for me even though ive been reading it and learning about it since i was a child i discover something new each and every time i open it as a muslim i always turn to the quran for guidance the stories of the prophetsisa jesus yousef joseph muhammad and nuh noah in particular have gotten me through some really tough times i saw that the men and women in the quran led very difficult lives and experienced much more horrible things than i have however they endured and were rewarded for it  my favorite stories in the holy book of course are those of the women in the quran the martyr sumaya who died rather than recant her faith asya who would have nothing to do with her husband the pharaohs horrible ways maryam mary the purest of women a young girl all alone in the world who gave birth to a miraculous child and endured the villagers spiteful rumors about her and finally the unnamed woman who chose to live the rest of her life afflicted with epilepsy and shunned by everyone around her in exchange for the promise of heaven upon her death i found these extraordinary women to be so relatable and admirable and i strive to be like them  another thing about the quran that enthralls me are the words themselves the word quran actually means recitation and the book is certainly meant to be recited the words flow in a way that no poet or author could ever dream of imitating every word every single letter has a meaning behind it many words can be interpreted hundreds of different ways there are some verses that only contain a single letter though only god knows what the significance of these letters is hundreds of thousands of books have been written attempting to interpret the quran still there are mysteries in the book that humans will never be able to solve  i know that there are many people in our world who speak ill of my faith and of my holy book i only hope that these people can learn to have an open mind and go out and actually find a credible source to tell them what its all about instead of just hating blindly i know that there are horrible monsters who commit unthinkable crimes and claim that they are doing it for the sake of my faith or the quran these people are despicable and true muslims reject them never does islam ever justify the killing of innocents it happens with every faith islam christianity judaism hinduism you name it people do whatever they want and claim that their religion justifies what theyre doing no faith i have ever heard of has ever claimed that it was acceptable to kill or hurt or hate other people these hypocritical psychos are the enemy not the religions that they skew to fit their own needs i only hope that one day people can learn to not classify millions of people based on the actions of a few lunatics  and whoever is patient and forgiving these most surely are actions due to courage  allah is all in all allah sees you and is with you wherever you are whatever you do  read in the name of your lord who created he created man from a clot read and your lord is most honorable who taught to write with the pen taught man what he knew not  and swell not thy cheek for pride at men nor walk in insolence through the earth for allah loveth not any arrogant boaster  acquire knowledge it enables its professor to distinguish right from wrong it lights the way to heaven it is our friend in the desert our company in solitude and companion when friendless it guides us to happiness it sustains us in misery it is an ornament amongst friends and an armour against enemies  allah will not give mercy to anyone except those who give mercy to other creatures  he is not a member of us who does not show the mercy to smaller than him and respect to the older if at all i have to reread a book every single year it is without an iota of doubt the holy quran cleansing of the mind and soul the words touch deeply and the heart feels profoundly i dedicate every good thing done all year round to all what i have come across here in this book reading it every year is a pure joy  recommended for anyone who wants to feel connected to the higher power in the truest terms i had been meaning to read the entire quran for many years but i never got around to it this was the year and i finished it right before the end of ramadan i found it very enlightening and the message is the same as the bible repent and worship god in all you do i spend a lot of time wondering why the abrahamic religions dont understand that  the quran reads a lot like the old testament there is a lot of fire and brimstone plus scalding water but the mercy of god is mentioned more than punishment  a warning to nonmuslims reading the quran for the first time the chapters in the beginning of the quran are longer and deal with a lot of legal issues the chapters at the end are short and read like psalms if you can get thru the first four chapters the reading gets easier and more fulfilling instrumental to understanding islam both the fundamental and progressive strains reading this allows you to see aspects of the religion the mass media never tells you about very important in this current political climate this translation is utterly beautiful with arberry making good use of verse format in an attempt to convey some sense of the rhythm and flow of the original arabic text which is often lost in translation as far as content goes it truly touches the soul  whosoever killeth a human being it shall be as if he had killed all mankind and whoso saveth the life of one it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind obviously along with the bible this is one of the two most significant books in history for the uninitiated the koranqurans layout like that of the bible can be offputting the best advice in both is not to start at the beginning and go forwards or at the end and work backwards the surahs in the koran are set in order of length and the ones near but not at the end are a good place to start reading  dawoods translation is pretty good but abdullah yusuf alis nadim and co london  is better and has the arabic text next to it which is handier for the student best of the best books in the world even in the universe a complete guidance for the whole mankind and the best possible solution for their problems id never want to impose my religion on anyone  id just like to make that clear that i respect all religions and i will never say that mine is superior to someone elses because thats not right so for those who do impose their religion on others let me ask you does this comply with the ethics of your religion almost all religions i am aware of have good ethical teachings and thusly one should not be rudedegrading to anyone regardless of their beliefs  moving on i still believe the quran should be read by everyone at least once why we all live on this earth together we must be able to understand one another to avoid conflict and to build on relationships do not limit yourself to just reading the quran though i am a muslim but i have read the bible and other holy texts i have the strongest belief that there is no different god there isnt a specific muslim god or a specific god for jews or a specific god for christians  instead for the monotheistic religions i believe we all have belief in the same god despite the names we may give him the only reason for the different religions in my beliefs is that there is a difference in the interpretation ever read the bible the ethicsmorals in that holy text reflect the ethicsmorals in this holy text  the reason for my review and i use the term lightly as i do not believe this a text we can review is so that i can try to convince others that we must not fight over religion we believe in ethics and it is unethical to fight  i have read the quran and it did change my life the thing about the quran about all holy texts is that everyone will have their own interpretation no person will get the same thing as someone else everyone takes away something different  id also like to note that when reading the quran you must consider the context it was written in at the time in arabia the text relates to their life and so there are many metaphors some choose to believe the quran literally others such as myself decide to look for the inner meaning i am in no place to say one is favourable over the other but please read this with an openmind  i have read a review where the reviewer criticised the quran for its encouragement of child brides and polagmy it is her interpretation and i cannot argue that however we must look at the context of the situation at this time women were being killed for simply being born for their own protection prophet muhammad sas advised his followers to marry many women for their protection the prophet did marry a yearold girl but his reasons were for the girls protection i hope this clears up any confusion if you have any questions i can try to answer to the best of my abilities one must have this i have my copy beside the bible and book of mormon and teachings of buddha and bahai i often pull the quran down and read from it when i need to check on islamic facts i have brought several copies and given to friends to help them understand the teachings i also recommend the movie the message what i learned from the quran and the message is  that one needs to learn about all religions and hear the message of all of the prophets the movie the message should be seen by all i have also done this  given copies of the bible and the book of mormon to friends also and introduced friends to the world of bahai we need to learn about our brothers and sisters all over the world and what they believe in open minds one does not finish this book it is a constant read
Atlas Shrugged,ayn rand makes my eyes hurt she does this not by the length of her six hundred thousand word diatribe but rather by the frequency with which she causes me to roll them do you want to know what ive learned after spending nearly two months reading ayn rands crap heres a brief rundown breakfast of champions style  socialists are scary socialists are frightening creatures who lurk in corners waiting to pounce on you they are unpredictable they have curvature of the spine and they often foam at the mouth this is a socialista socialist  capitalists on the other hand are calm and rational beings who never lose their tempers you can always trust a capitalist and they are super easy to spot toojust look for the hummingbirds who sew their clothes for them this is a capitalista capitalist  ayn rands characters come in only two flavors and which kind you get depends solely on the extent to which they embody her philosophical ideals the capitalists the good guys are the moral heroes of the story the ones who fight back against economic regulation this regulation is seen as unwanted intervention the government essentially trespassing on ones property rights by means of unfair unfair to the capitalists i might point out legislation the bad guys are of course represented by the socialiststhe ones passing the legislation although rand does a good job of throwing anyone else into this category who while not active participants in passing these laws may not be totally opposed to them either  the problem with all of this is the fact that her characters are not at all believable they are robots who mechanically spew forth her inane drivel or if they are of the other flavor behave in a manner so utterly ridiculous as to demonstrate the rationality of the capitalist over the vicious guntoting socialist whos come to rob your house rape your ma and shoot your pa rand is so egregious in the maltreatment of her antithetic characters that its almost laughable beyond that the narrative itself is monotonous and repetitive this is not exactly a beach read  but even if i were to put all of that aside i still wouldnt be able to get over the fact that rands argument here is to put an end to social collectivism of every form that means no social security no unemployment insurance no federally funded health care no public roads no public housing no public education no income taxes no property taxesdoes this not sound insane i get the whole ooh and aah aspect of libertarian freedoms but im betting there wouldnt be a lot of volunteers willing to relinquish their adequately funded public services on the basis of a free market economy and ultimately this is the fundamental principle on which rand and i disagree although i do believe and strongly that the government should have no authority to interfere in the private lives of its citizens do i think the government should also abstain from interfering in the regulation of the economy hellz no i want those corporate mother fuckers taxed and if that means ima start foaming at the mouth then so be it  ultimately this novel is more absurdist fiction than dystopian fiction rand takes an allinorallout approach to problem solving there can be no moral ambiguityeither youre with her or youre not and im not but what does she care rand is an unabashed admirer of the wealthy industrialist and it is for him that she bats her eyes and licks her lips not for me ayn rands characters are almost completely defined by the extent to which they embrace her beliefs a good guy by definition is someone who agrees with her a bad guy someone who dares to have a different point of view for all the lipservice rand pays to individualism she brooks no dissent from her heroes none of her socalled individualists ever expresses a point of view significantly different from hers  to illustrate the gulf between rands characters and human reality consider this behavior when dagny taggart meets hank rearden she dutifully becomes his property for no other reason than that hes the most randian male around when john galt arrives ownership of the prize female transfers from rearden to galt because galt is the more randian of the two does it ever occur to hank to be resentful or jealous does taggart experience loyalty or regret might taggart love rearden despite his lesser randness no those are all things that human beings might feel  in a related departure from reality sex in randland is more or less indistinguishable from rape foreplay romance capitalists dont have time for that commie nonsense  the real focus of atlas shrugged is to extoll rands philosophy not to debate it since no one in randland with any any intelligence or competence could have a different point of view about rands philosophy ill just make two points which im not going to bother providing evidence for at the moment  the first is that like most social darwinists rand fell short in her understanding of natural selection her philosophy was largely based on the false belief that nature invariably favors individual selfishness in reality evolution has made homo sapiens a social animal cooperation and compassion are very human traits more importantly even if cold selfishness were mans nature in the wild it would not necessarily follow that that would be the best way for us to behave in our semicivilized modern condition  the second point is that contrary to rands belief pure laissezfaire capitalism never works it invariably leads to exploitation of the poor and middle class and to environmental catastrophe the best economic system that has ever been devised  so far  is a mixture of capitalism and socialism would you like to hear the only joke ive ever written q how many objectivists does it take to screw in a lightbulb a pause then disdainfully uhone and thus it is that so many of us have such a complicated relationship with the work of ayn rand unabashed admirers at the age of  unabashedly horrified by  after hanging out with some actual objectivists and witnessing what aholes they actually are and also realizing that rand and her cronies were one of the guiltiest parties when it came to the s red scare here in america here in rands second massive manifestoslashnovel we follow the stories of a number of titans of the industrial age  the big powerful white males who built the railroad industry the big powerful white males who built the electrical utility companies  as well as a thinlyveiled roosevelt new deal administration whose every attempt to regulate these titans according to rand is tantamount evilwise to killing and eating babies even when its child labor laws they are ironically passing ultimately its easy to see in novels like this one why rand is so perfect for late teenagers but why she elicits eye rolls by ones midtwenties because objectivism is all about being right and dropping out if others cant understand that and let em all go to hell as far as im concerned without ever taking into account the unending amount of compromise and cooperation and sometimes sheer altruism that actually makes the world work recommended but with a caveat that you read it before youre old enough to know better atlas shrugged is a flawed epic strident with a swaggering ambition yet almost fablelike in its overly simplistic social and economic criticisms  this is more of a philosophical social commentary than a literary monument the characterization is where it fails rand draws stick figures for antagonists caricatures strawmen to act as foil to her politicoeconomicsocial vehicle this is the book that made everyone mad in the late fifties progressive liberals were spurned due to its vitriolic antigovernment stance and conservatives stayed away in droves due to rands over the top atheism  as provocative and controversial as it is i wondered at the society that had produced rand and marveled at the influence she had on our culture since its publication i have read many controversial books and have wondered how many critics have actually read the work atlas shrugged makes me wonder how many fans have actually read it  rand would no doubt be critical of big business today with its corporate dollar laden cushions and aristocratically removed leadership rands libertarianism shares with sinclairs socialism in that it looks good in print  the length yep its a  plus page monster rand forces her readers to be submerged to live in the dystopian wasteland for two or three months to fully comprehend her vision  finally i am left with a feeling an assurance that i do not like ms rand and dont care for her arrogance and her casual dismissal of much of what is good in society     thought about this and have decided that even if i dont care for rand disagree with much of her ideas i did like parts of this book  shagged at last the sequel  written while she was still alive but published posthumously after her death in  shagged at last is the posthumous sequel to ayn rands greatest achievement and last work of fiction atlas shrugged not counting shagged at last  in this novel she dramatizes the shortcomings of her unique objectivist philosophy through an intellectual mystery story and magical mystery tour that intertwines sex ethics sex metaphysics sex epistemology sex politics sex economics sex whatever and sex  reconsidering her worldview she concludes that in order to be truly beneficial to society individuals sex must not be just the fun bit between the serious parts it requires serious love action between the private parts  in this sequel which is the equal of the prequel to the sequel ayn rand abandons objectivism and embraces sex activism without endorsing either active sexism or subjectivism  likewise she urges us to abandon the protestant work ethic and embrace the catholic sex ethic  her motto no safety net no protection  i read this about  years ago and if im honest i can recall very little about it  at the time i didnt know anything about ayn rand nor was i aware that the book had a heavy political  philosophical agenda or that culture wars washed around it  i think i was prompted into reading it when seeing it in a store a day or two after seeing officer barbradys critique on south park  a review that didnt tell me much as it was in a leftleaning cartoon but from an authoritarian character    i did of course notice the politics of the thing at work whilst reading it i wasnt and still am not a political reader and such messages have to be particularly heavy handed to be noticed even more so to distract me from the story  as a scientist i had a natural sympathy for our hero who appeared to be standing up for intellect reason and clear thinking against a sea of red tape vested interests and resistance to change however even with the powerful following wind of being in the protagonists head and seeing everything through their lens the point of view pushed by the narrative did grow less and less palatable the bias grew so thick as to stray into parody everyone in our heros way was a useless moocher seeking to rob the earnings he had made with his own two hands everyone who disagreed with him was a lentilfarming hippy or a selfabsorbed oxygen sink who refused all opportunity to help themselves  i recall that the story remained mildly interesting and i did make it to the end i had a libertarian friend who some years later became teary eyed when describing the john galt speech as the best piece of literature in the history of writing i didnt admit to him that i had grown so bored with that part that i skipped to the end of it  its a long book and the story as far as i recall it is far from terrible however the thickly applied lectures on libertarian philosophy  which felt to me deeply selfish amoral and as empty as they are shallow  all while describing everyone else as selfish greedy thieves  grated on this usually oblivious reader to a point where the potential enjoyment was heavily eroded i only gave this book  stars because it was so tedious and repetitive i actually have some things to say in defense of the usual criticisms but more on that in a minute whether or not you agree with her philosophy ayn rand does make some good points in favor of her argument i can forgive it for its exaggerated depiction of socialism as a system which rewards the weak and lazy and parasitizes the intelligent and productive honestly if you install any system which allows people to thrive as parasites plenty of people will take advantage of it its just human nature unfortunately this book only seems to be aware of human nature where it guarantees the failure of the system its trying to shoot down it never takes into account the inevitable abuses of capitalism by fallible human beings special interest groups politicians making laws which favor corporations they hold stock in sweat shops the whole military industrial complex etc while the authors point of view is understandable given the communism she came to america to escape and the fact that the issues i listed above probably werent in the news as much back then as they are now i still dont think her long long long argument holds up the brilliant attractive articulate morally perfect industrialist heroes of atlas shrugged are not real people ayn rand herself said in defense against her critics they are not man as he is rather man as he should be which would be great in another book i have no objection to admittedly portraying nonexistant ideals if it makes a good point if such people really existed capitalism could work ayn rand seems perfectly aware of the shortcomings of human nature when they manifest themselves under communism but then offers as an alternative another system which could only actually work for the nonexistant ideal men she made up so as a piece of propaganda it doesnt fully convince me i suppose if i were completely on the nurture side of the nature vs nurture debate on human behavior i could have simply bought the idea that installing an economic system based on moral principles could create a better culture and thus better people though if theres anything history shows us over and over again its that no new belief or set of rules has ever succeeded on that front as a novel well its full of excessively longwinded monologues and drags on but it did keep me interested enough to see it through to the end and forced me to think so i have to give it some credit im not going to write a big review for a big book the thought of it is daunting and the return minimal what i will say is there are parts of this book i loved and parts that made me cringe but the enjoyment outweighed the discomfort it was probably the summer before my sophomore year in college i took a greyhound bus from columbia mo to central wisconsin to visit my grandparents in an attempt to gather family history for what i knew would turn into my senior projectthesis this trip became an annual tradition and often i traveled by greyhound bus it was cheap it was local instead of driving two hours to the nearest airport in st louis it was fun you want me to sit in a moving vehicle with nothing else to do besides sleep and read for something like  hours where do i sign up i was a busy kid in those days working a few different jobs going to school trying to maintain a relationship i was tired and the idea of having to just sit there and do whatever i wanted sounded like pure awesomeness  the book that i took with me on that trip was the fountainhead it was probably the best book i could take on a lengthy bus trip and after all my different trips to wisconsin that one occasion sticks in my mind more than many of the others just because of that book we wont go into what my grandparents said when they saw what i was reading but most of their comments involved something about the possibility of losing my eyesight by reading such small print it didnt matter what people thought or what they said sure there was a lot of extraneous words in the fountainhead but it made an impression on me one could argue that since i was in college everything would make an impression on me but i like to think i was a little more discerning than all that i didnt like beloved which was being shoved down our throats in just about every class i took  the fountainhead is the book that people really love to hate because of everything ayn rand believed in at least thats the case until they come across atlas shrugged then people get their panties in a much larger twist they realize that what she proposed in the fountainhead wasnt quite as scary as they originally thought after all the fountainhead focused more on individualism atlas shrugged went for the jugular with all that talk of objectivism  the thing about ayn rand is very few people actually have read her everyone feels they have an opinion about her mostly because of things theyve heard from other people she had a reputation during her life and she certainly maintained that reputation after she died shes infamous for being a coldhearted evil moneyhungry bitch  capitalism is grand its good to be selfish etc etc and from there her fiction is immediately poohpoohed there are accusations that her characters are cardboard onedimensional that theyre either blatantly bad if they dont support objectivism and blatantly good if they do  im not convinced its all that simple  its not an easy book to review because where do you really start do you focus on the story the style the author her beliefs do you talk about your own beliefs does it matter who is john galt one thing i decided i wouldnt do is lambaste the book because i immediately disagreed with certain aspects of her philosophy on the other hand i also wouldnt just applaud the book because i agreed with other aspects im not trying to prove a point here and tell all the people who dislike this that theyre right or wrong and the people who love it that theyre right or wrong  the complaint that rand used her fiction as a vehicle for her beliefs doesnt hold water with me seriously how many writers do that upton sinclair did it i maintain that most writers in some capacity use their fiction to propose their beliefs but as usual its especially scary when its a woman who does it good gravy  i will say i am not offended by what rand believed there are worse beliefs in the world and much more dangerous ones i can even get behind some of what rand proposed it doesnt mean this is the best book ive ever read or that i wholeheartedly agree with everything she wrote it could have been pared down a few hundred pages  i noticed the editor even got a little tired and lazy towards the end of the book did it make me think absolutely thats what makes a book good  i appreciated the fountainhead more maybe its because of the time and when that i read it and thats something that cant be repeated this many years later i might not even like the fountainhead that much if i read it now but theres something to be said about individualism that i can get behind and if thats the only thing i agree with when it comes to rand so be it atlas shrugged is a novel this ought to be fairly obvious considering the fact that none of the events in it bear any resemblance to reality and its a bricksized prose thing alas some people take it as a sort of manifesto about how working hard is good and socialism is bad  plotwise dagny has a railway and train business  and by god she does everything to make it run well a lot of things get in her way a socialist government redistributing resources to everyone without an ounce of brain incompetent collaborators and good businessmen vanishing off without a trace luckily she has extraordinary businessman hank rearden on her side and together they will doublehandedly try to save the world theyll also fall in love with each other because it feels like theyre the last two competent people left  alas who is john galt the question is asked repeatedly whenever a competent man disappears and the mystery grows deeper and deeper before it finally gets resolved spoiler john galt is the man of ultimate competence who has realized that all competent people can give the socialist world the middle finger by removing themselves from it and letting it die on its own its very dramatic seduced by so much competence and a speech thats so long it could go around the ecuator twice dagny throws herself in his arms forsaking rearden who is john galt hes the biggest disappointment in this novel  honestly as a novel its not that bad except for the speech and the ending come for the extreme views on the wonders of working hard stay for the train porn people in some circles have venerated ayn rands atlas shrugged into a bible status probably not only for the length of the book which is  pages long the average bible has around  pages the book conveys a strong philosophical stream which is called objectivism however this philosophical system is basically ignored in the traditional curricula of the philosophy  the book appears from time to time in some other popular culture like in the movie mad men last week i saw an ingesting documentary about a big fraud where some very clever finance gurus established a scheme that allowed them to steel billions from the eu the fact is the favorite book of the main figure in that felonious enterprise was nothing other than atlas shrugged he also bought it as a mandatory reading to all of his companions  before i go into details let me just say that during my long reading and thinking process of about the book and ideas therein i was not convinced that i should immediately convert to the church of the objectivism the good thing is although that i dont regret reading this lengthy book the reason for that is that it didnt leave me indifferent to many things that characters of the story convey what was really bothering me was that rand puts forward her message and philosophy in a kind of a totalitarian way characters are either very good or very bad things are often just black or white  as for the philosophy itself like with many other philosophical streams they have both good and bad sides theres no onesizefitsall philosophy even if ayn rand would probably disagree on that in the case of objectivism i can say the same  there are some excellent ideas and there are complete rubbish and utopian dreams which would not work in the realworld  on a metaphysical level rand proposes an objective reality that is in contrast to subjective reality where we mentally filter the real reality and construct our own mental models often flawed the objective reality is hard compared to the subjective reality the problem is that we will never be able to take in the totality of things and processes leaving us only with the fragments of objectivism here we are almost on the same page with the author  one should strive to be as objective as possible and make all efforts to improve our perception of the world around us there are tons of good discussion about those two very important and very interesting dimensions in other philosophical literature  on the epistemological side of the philosophy rand proposes reason in many cases reason is accepted as infallible whereas conclusions derived from pure sensations are often unreliable but not always more on reason consult kahnemantversky system  vs system  or gerd gigerenzer who has an opposite argument  ayn rands take on ethic which is i would say can be characterized as a brutal selfinterest probably this is the most problematic area in the book and her overall philosophy which became an endless battleground for many thinkers the characters of atlas shrugged are perfectly crafted to put across some strong points why a society built on selfinterest is the only right one the same applies to the political side of the rands philosophy which of course is pure and radical capitalism if we are forced to generalize the society is actually divided in those who create and those who appreciate more or less the life style of a parasite the problem with that is also that often parasites are first to attack people who create a milieu for them to exist id like to stop going into more details here this is a subject requiring some more time for reviewing maybe someday ill return to it  the story itself is a bit mediocre for my taste but the philosophical dimension of it managed to keep my attention all the way through those lengthy chapters if youre just interested in the philosophical side of this work the crux in the book are the speeches given by the two of the main protagonists  danconia and especially  john galt the  page long danconia speech aka the money speech and the  page long john galt speech would give a good grasp of the essence of the objectivism philosophy at nineteen this book is lifechanging it appeals to mans burgeoning ego but at thirty with likes rearranging it falls the wayside like goatees go  its not just that it seeps with pretension or rambles at length with longeuer which tests us at paying attention to philosophy which stinks of manure  wheres the fun of cheering execs who battle with drab politicians and have odd rapefantasy sex and the writing is like a morticians  but i suppose when youre youthful and blithe theres some fun to be had with this book stuffy smart women in bed read her writhe and dissect now her smoldering look  but with age comes a teaspoon of wisdom which tells us its not all about me and makes us think this book is dumb i cant now get through book one lessso three  but perhaps im just missing the point no after all this has gone quite mainstream the market crash has made many anoint t so but to me tis just ann coulters wetdream  so why three stars you may ask me i think its all in your perspective at a time i loved it damn youve unmaskd me but now i think of nothing but invective  and so to each their own these ramblings i disown in terms of fictional stylism this book truly deserves mixed reviews compared to characters in any serious work of fiction rands characters are onesided shallow and dull rand does a horrible job trying to portray any living human being  even rand herself and other objectivists have lead more intricate lives than those of the characters however her use of imagery is strong the plot is intriguing and fun to follow until about  of the way through after which it simply becomes ridiculous there is no obscurity however about her central message and the clarity of the theme does not really interfere with the other elements of the work except perhaps characterization furthermore readers shouldnt be carried away by her flawed philosophical arguments for example consider the title of a chapter a is a however in the spirit of philosophical inquiry when one inquires what sort of justification rand has for this she simply says that this is true and appeals to a sense of selfevidence however the appeal to selfevidence is inexcusable for when we say something is selfevident that does not mean it is in some sense absolutely true  it only means that we for whatever reason strongly believe it to be absolutely true in some sense she wishes us to believe that a is a is an encounter with some sort of truth that is in some sense out there independent of human consciousness of it this borders on platonism which rand herself vehemently denounces but the immediacy of encounter with the truth for rand a phenomenological act is the sole source of justification which by the way is not made very explicit in this book for her statement a is a of course modern symbolicmathematical logic has also accepted this premise however symbolic logic has accepted it as an axiom that is a statement true by definition there is a notsosubtle distinction between an axiom and a vague philosophically meaningless sense of truth that rand advocates for its justification furthermore the statement that reason is the grounds for epistemology is simply absurd it is not worthless epistemologically speaking and rational thought is a foundation of knowledge but it is not the only foundation while this works very well in a universe that is composed exclusively of valid ie truth of a conditional under all interpretations eg if p then p statements and invalid statements it fails miserably in a universe such as our own that is composed mostly of consistent statements for example if i say that if i take an umbrella out today then i take an umbrella out and i will be dry this may come out truei may block myself from rain or it may not even be raining however it is still conceivable that i will be pushed into the ocean and get wet hence the truthfullness of this statement is consistent  it could be false or it could be true however because the statement itself can conceivably be true and false it is not a meaningless statement it is out of such shaky foundations that rand constructs a system of political and ethical prescriptions however the real problem with the work is in her line of reasoning we may accept her selfdescribed metaphysical epistemological and ethical systems but even granting her this much there are philosophers who have used her starting points and arrived at arguments for democratic socialism adlers four dimensions of philosophy is an excellent contrast to rands line of reasoning far from being the works of incompetent moocher academicians such thinkers as adler present coherent well argued conclusions that help illuminate the limitations of rands personal attempts at constructing a system of thought her writing may sway you to be persuaded and her imagery will surely make an impression on you however her actual philosophical statements are objectionable at best and at worst simply wrong from each according to his ability to each according to his need karl marx  if youre tired of listening to the senseless shpeel of nightly pundits parroting talking points from the left or the right if you no longer trust the talking heads espousing the positions of the socialist who seeks to rely upon government solutions to solve the woes of our country and of the capitalist who opposes giving more power to politicians in order that they may decide whats best for all of us and how we must think and act for the greater good andor if youre openminded enough to hear a different perspective from a renowned author from the s this may be the book for you be warned though that this is a story of the extreme and is not i believe meant to be a futuristic prediction having said that as you read atlas shrugged again keeping an open mind youll hear things which sound very much like the world we now live in and the world in which we are more and more likely to become  i found this book to be shockingly prescient and from that perspective id call this a must read however omg this book was loooong  some  pages many of the chapters like for example the speech of john gault went on and on and on at some point you kinda go yeah i get it and start skimming otherwise id have rated this masterpiece as a true star wellwritten interesting slightly patronising and smug and way way way too fucking long a dystopian engineering thriller about people who hate people its the book i was born to read baby  thats to say i genuinely enjoy reading ayn rands stories we both love industry and shes the only author i know of who can get as excited about it as i can but i really hope it goes without saying that her writing ability and philosophy are tripe   and its really set people back a lot so many other decent books that i can think of have been uncomfortable journeys for the author who ultimately create a stories about how we dont love enough how selfish we are and how wrong that is  i find it tough to see out of my own head how i fit into the bigger picture in order to make myself and others happy by having us all get along the easiest option is always to make myself happy and hope the rest all works itself out but thats really not the way to be so what a relief it would be for someone like me to hear one single book amongst a mass telling me to be empathetic that says forget other people those instincts were totally right be a dck but shes just plain wrong  the problem is i sympathise with her and in interviews if you try hard to listen objectively lawlz she does have some good points the problem is that she says its all or nothing absolute subscription to her philosophy or complete rejection of it you cant incorporate the good elements into some other broaderthinking political structure so what do you do you tell her to go do one  this review by whittaker chambers explains it better than i could and in one line tells us why logistically objectivism will never work  we would not place much confidence in the diagnosis of a do
The Brothers Karamazov,if you like your books to move in a linear fashion this book is not for you it hops around and attention must be paid or you will find yourself flipping back a few pages to reestablish the thread of the story i took this on a plane flight crazy right not exactly the normal light reading i take on flights it was a stroke of genius i absolutely fell under the thrall of dostoyevkys prose thank you to my fellow travelers who didnt feel the need to chat with the guy who obviously is so frilling bored he has resorted to reading a russian novel i zipped through three hundred pages like it was butter and found myself absolutely captivated by the evolving drama of the brothers karamazov the women that drive them crazy and the father that brings to mind the words justifiable homicide  i have to give a plug to these everymans library editions a  page novel that feels like a  page novel despite the smaller size the print size is still easily readable i will certainly be picking up more of these editions especially the russian novels that are translated by the magical duo of richard pevear and larissa volokhonsky  photobucket translators volokhonsky and pevear  one of my complaints when i was in college and liked to torture myself with the largest most incomprehensible russian books i could find was that the nicknames and diminutives of various russian names increased my frustration level and decreased my ability to comprehend the plots i certainly spent too much time scratching my head and reading feverishly to see if i could figure out from the interactions of the characters if vanky was actually ivan or boris or uncle vashy i did not have that issue with this book despite a plot that skipped around i did not experience the confusion that has marred my memories of other russian novels  this is the story of the karamazov family the father fyodor and his four sons there are three legitimate sons dmitri ivan and alyosha but i believe that smerdyakov is also an illegitimate son though not confirmed by the author given the tendencies of fyodor to hop on anything in a skirt i would say chances are pretty good that the boy is a karamazov  the recklessness at which fyodor lived his life is really the basis of the plot the motivations of the other characters all revolve around reactions to the careless and insensitive behavior of the father dostoyevsky wrote a description of fyodor that still gives me a shiver every time i read it  fyodors physiognomy by that time presented something that testified acutely to the characteristics and essence of his whole life besides the long fleshy bags under his eternally insolent suspicious and leering little eyes besides the multitude of deep wrinkles on his fat little face a big adams apple fleshy and oblong like a purse hung below his sharp chin giving him a sort of repulsively sensual appearance add to that a long carnivorous mouth with plump lips behind which could be seen the little stumps of black almost decayed teeth he sprayed saliva whenever he spoke  fyodor   fyodor is a skirt chaser and since he is rich he can afford to throw these opulent parties that evolvedevolve into orgies with the local women given the description above i can only speculate that gallons and gallons of good vodka must be in play to achieve this end problems mount as he falls in lovelust with a young beauty of dubious morals named grushenka  photobucket  his oldest son dmitri is also in love with this young woman and as they both vie for her hand the tension between the karamazovs ratchets up to dangerous levels dmitri while pursuing this dangerous siren throws over katerina a girl that he owes  rubles after fyodor is murdered it was similar to waiting around for someone to kill jrthose same rubles become central to the subsequent trial to convict dmitri of the murder the murderer is revealed to the reader and as the trial advances the tension increases as we begin to wonder just how the truth will be revealed  there are subplots with father zosima and his life before becoming a monk alyosha the youngest son was studying to be a monk under zosimas tutelage but becomes embroiled in the power struggles of the family and leaves the monastery to seek a life in the real world alyosha also becomes involved with the care of a dying child named ilyusha who is in the book to illustrate the heavy burden that the seemingly inconsequential actions of people can leave on others the book explores that theme extensively  it was fascinating to watch the ripple effects of each characters actions as the chapters advance every time i picked this book up i had to read large chunks because it simply would not let me go the reactions and high drama created by the smallest spark of contention in the characters kept the pages turning and as new information snapped into place i found my pulse quickening as my brain sprang ahead trying to guess where dostoyevsky was taking me next  i worked with a young woman years ago that said that i reminded her of one of the karamazov brothers because of the diverse personalities of the brothers and the fact that i can see a little of myself in each brother im still left with the grand mystery as to which brother she was referring too it serves me right for waiting so long to read this beautiful book  if if there was still any doubt let me confirm that this actually is the greatest book ever written but be warned that you need to set aside a solid month to get through it and its not light readingthis is a dense work of philosophy disguised as a simple murder mystery but its well worth the effort it tackles the fundamental question of human existencehow best to live ones lifein a truly engaging way dostoevsky created  brothers ivan alexei and dmitri with opposite answers to this fundamental question and set them loose in the world to see what would happen a testament to dostoevskys genius is he didnt know how the book would evolve when he started writing as a consequence the book really isnt about the plot at all but about how these brothers evolve and deal with their struggles based on their differing world views  dostoevsky articulates better than anyone how human beings really are what i would call walking contradictions perhaps all of our struggles in life boil down to the reality that we desire contradictory things simultaneously if you like your novels with good character development this is the masterwork dostoevskys characters are more real more human than any other at different points along the way you will identify with them sympathize with them curse them agonize over them celebrate them you will be moved  reading this book was a deeply personal experience for me because i saw myself in one of the characters and i didnt like what i saw my worldview in fact my entire direction in life shifted as a result of this experience i cant guarantee the same results for you but you owe it to yourself to set aside the time someday for the brothers karamazov  be sure to read the pevear volokhonsky translation im writing this review as i read frankly im astounded by how good this is and how compelling im finding it astounded why should that be this is a classic after all true but it breaks just about every rule of fiction the plot so far is virtually nonexistent three brothers get together with their wastrel father and all sorts of dysfunction including an odd love triangle involving the father and the eldest son are revealed the brothers arent particular close to each other and really not much happens except that they meet at a monastery where the youngest son lives for an audience with a holy man whos dying and then they go their separate ways except that they have kind of random meetings with each other and with the woman involved in the love triangle and theres a vague sense of foreboding that something will happen to the father and the characters not really the kinds of characters were used to in contemporary fiction these are characters who struggle with all kinds of philosophical issues and enjoy nothing more than debating them at length with each other sounds boring well its not not at all  by the way im reading the ignet avsey translation based on kriss recommendation and its wonderful so far    one of the things i find so fascinating about this book is how it can be both one of the most dark and cynical works ive read and one of the most overtly spiritual and soulful this is a true testament to dostoyevskys range to how effortlessly he contains multitudes in this masterful work    alert some spoilers to follow  one of the most cynical passages ive read so far is about how following the holy mans death his fellow monks are all shocked when his corpse begins to smell because of course if hed been a true holy man they figured his corpse wouldnt have smelled at all so the fact that it started smelling makes them all begin to question whether hed really been what theyd imagined soon several of them begin to remember times when hed been shockingly and suspiciously lessthanholy and then the pileon really begins as the monks begin competing to disavow him the most with only a couple of his friends holding onto his good memory but even they are cowed into silence by the general gleeful animosity oh this dostoyevsky really knows how to plumb all thats dark and pathetic about human nature    after about page  the plot really picks up we have murder a mad dash to a woman heavy drinking protestations of love and the police moving in after the languid plotting of the opening sections im almost breathless    the use of the narrator here is so interesting we have a nameless figure who lives in the place where the events take place recounting the story almost as if recounting a legend at the same time we get the characters most intimate thoughts and long speeches that the narrator could not possibly have known firsthand it all adds to the notion that this may be more the narrators own tall tale than any faithful recitation of historywhich of course is true because its a novel but the way the artificial nature of the story gets highlighted makes me think its another example of dostroyevskys cynicism at work    all signs point to dmitry as the perpetrator but the way he protests his innocence just makes you want to believe him hes having a hard time of it though the prosecutor and magistrate conduct a long interview of him and the evidence is damning  interestingly after dmitry is taken away the scene shifts radically revisiting the young boys wed briefly met earlier what is dostroyevsky doing here in the figure of kolya a  yearold prankster wunderkind he seems to be pointing out the limits of rationalism the way it can be abused to wow those with slightly less knowledge and how it can ultimately come off as a big joke    now things have become complicated whos really guilty of this crime we know who did it because he tells ivan but then he blames ivan himself for his athiesmfor influencing him by the notion that nothing we do matters anyway    at the beginning of the trial we see dostoyevskys biting and cynical nature reassert itself as he describes the spectacle that the event has becomethe people whove traveled from far away to witness it drawn by their desire to see the two female rivals for dmitry and dmitry himself whos especially attractive to the ladies because of his reputation as a ladies man the proceedings themselves seem secondary to the spectacle and the sport    the trial itself is a fascinating deconstruction of dmitrys characterhow that character can be everything the prosecutor says and yet at the same time its everything his defense counsel says too were given to long speeches about the character that are fascinating psychological studies the lawyers themselves debate about this newfangled science of psychologyhow plastic it is how it can be used to justify and explain anything you can see dostoyevsky working on multiple levels here showing multiple sides of his character that dont quite cohere and thats exactly the point that people are complex and inconsistent and constantly at war with themselves so what does character mean what does a character mean in a novel  and just when it looks like the defense will carry the day    the coda is a plan for escape and the funeral of a young boy and yet it end on a curiously uplifting note a statement of faith and everlasting remembranceand a change for the better in many of the other young boys united as they are in love of the lost boy who thus becomes an almost christian martyr the one whose death brings love to all his friends  and so dostoyevsky brings to a close his massive masterpiece and so i end these little scribbles the brothers karamazov is the greatest novel the brothers karamazov is the greatest grotesque novel and im afraid my interpretations of it will hardly be very popular what is god what is man and what are their relationships you see i close my eyes and think if everyone has faith where does it come from and then they say that it all came originally from fear of the awesome phenomena of nature and that there is nothing to it at all what i think all my life ive believed then i die and suddenly theres nothing and only burdock will grow on my grave as i read in one writer its terrible what what will give me back my faith  in his deepest novel fyodor dostoyevsky created the whole gallery of human types  both male and female  that later ts eliot will define as the hollow men vanity ivan does not have god he has his idea not on my scale but hes silent i think hes a freemason i asked him  hes silent i hoped to drink from the waters of his source  hes silent only once did he say something what did he say alyosha picked up hastily i said to him then everything is permitted in that case he frowned fyodor pavlovich our papa was a little pig he said but his thinking was right thats what he came back with  fyodor karamazov the father was a swine a hungry greedy hog that would devour everything and everybody on its way and nothing bar death would stop him oh we love to live among people and to inform these people at once of everything even our most infernal and dangerous ideas we like sharing with people and who knows why we demand immediately on the spot that these people respond to us at once with the fullest sympathy enter into all our cares and concerns nod in agreement with us and never cross our humor  dmitri karamazov is a parrot a popinjay  the poseur who admires nothing but his own reflection but ivan loves nobody ivan is not one of us people like ivan are not our people my friend theyre a puff of dust the wind blows and the dust is gone  ivan karamazov is a peacock proud of his iridescent tail  he cares about nothing but his empty and fruitless ideas his heart trembled as he entered the elders cell why why had he left why had the elder sent him into the world here was quiet here was holiness and there  confusion and a darkness in which one immediately got lost and went astray  alyosha karamazov is a frightened calf a cats paw  an infantile whipping boy created to serve the others and to be used while the sun moon and stars might be an interesting subject for smerdyakov it was of completely thirdrate importance and that he was after something quite different be it one way or the other in any event a boundless vanity began to appear and betray itself an injured vanity besides  smerdyakov is a rat  he hides in darkness but he hates the entire world and he is capable of any meanness  man is ones own enemy by living one unavoidably destroys oneself and the others hurrah for karamazov  those are the concluding words of this bombastic brick of a book i am more than willing to chime in to cheer for the brothers karamazov who finally finally made me give in to the genius of dostoevsky fully without anger without resentment and fight after a year of grappling with his earlier novels  this is doubtless his magnum opus the shining lead star in a brilliant cosmos there are many similarities to his earlier novels and his characters fight with the same inner demons as the predecessors and yet there is something milder more soothing in the brothers karamazov there is mature perfection in this novel  yes smerdyakov is an underprivileged hateful sufferer but he is not lost to compassion and care in the same way as the nihilistic man writing his notes from underground  and dimitri is rash and bold and full of contradictions but he is not as confused as raskolnikov he does not impose the dogma of suffering in the sense of crime and punishment on his family and community he has a plan for living not for suffering  ivan is a brooding intellectual but he is not stonecold like stavrogin in devils his conflicted heart and intellect are connected to the world  alyosha thank goodness is a sweet and innocent character but nothing like the awful christlike idiot myshkin from the idiot he knows how to live and interact and he is willing to step away from rigid prejudices and principles to comfort the ones he loves  what about the women grushenka is not destroyed by the love of several men like nastasya and even katerina ivanovna is given a complex divided soul not just a shallow platform for men to use at their convenience and throw away when they have made their point she has her own points to make  why do the brothers karamazov work so well  i believe dostoyevsky made the decision to paint a family just like it is with all the contradictory emotions and actions and all the mood swings and difficult situations he had already established his religious and political ideas in earlier works and he could afford to let the characters be what they naturally were without judging them from the standpoint of history and society thus he could be the storyteller he naturally was without any agenda but love for the story he told  the plot is both simple and complex be careful what you wish for it might come true  as the three or four brothers and the women they love in different ways and fashions face the murder of the old patriarchal buffoon all of them have to come to terms with the painful reality of loving and hating at the same time  a bad parent is still a parent and a dead parent still has power over the lives of his offspring the karamazov character much cited throughout the novel becomes a synonym for any human being in his or her dealings with that complicated microcosm called family  and why because he was of the broad karamazov character  thats just what i am leading up to  capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions and capable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths  because dostoyevsky dares to let go of his mission to prove that russian nationalism and christian orthodoxie are at the centre of the meaning of life he actually makes a case for both in a much more convincing way than he ever could with his more concept and ideadriven earlier works the humour in the unforgettable scenes with the unspeakable conduct of the stinking father zossima are so much better than the pseudochristian rants of myshkin and the intellectual understanding of the dangers of community worship in the story of the grand inquisitor is as true now as it was back then showing the way to the core of both religious and political extremism  this craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time for the sake of common worship theyve slain each other with the sword they have set up gods and challenged one another put away your gods and come and worship ours or we will kill you and your gods and so it will be to the end of the world even when gods disappear from the earth they will fall down before idols just the same  so what is the redeeming feature of the karamazovs then why do i feel like shouting over and over  hurrah for karamazov  they love each other they really do in a crooked angry way in a distorted strange way but they do they love each other despite being completely different in their approach to life and they support each others right to life love and happiness in the end they help each other make the best of a muddle and that is the best any family can do help each other deal with the blows that families tend to inflict on themselves  exile in a place worse than siberia oh america what a delightful irony dimitris words are is manageable if you make peace with your loved ones and the final pages leave me bowing to the beauty of the insight that man and woman can love each other in so many different ways and that love is not exclusive but inclusive  dostoyevsky you wrote the perfect novel hurrah reading dostoevskys the brothers karamazov is comparable to pushing a beautiful grand piano up a very steep hill kevin ansbro  why oh why in a world filled with endless opportunities to enjoy oneself did i think it was a good idea to embark on a thcentury book thats almost the size of an electric toaster i have friends i have a wife i have a life heck i even have one of those home television sets that you so often hear about  the brothers karamazov is by no means a galloping read it is a whale of a novel that requires the reader to drop anchor and bob about on fyodors ocean of esteemed eloquence for as long as it takes it was a slog at times and im ashamed to say that i almost jumped ship on many occasions  dostoevsky threw everything but the kitchen sink at this his magnum opus he plucks random details from the alcoves of his mind and scatters them like confetti and there are more characters here than you could wave a stick at his imagery is vivid without being overdone the writing is tight and beautifully paced  the story focuses on fyodor karamazov a boorish and wicked father and his three dissimilar sons collectively the eponymous brothers are perhaps designed to represent all of us philosophical and theological discussions abound the existence of god morality and freedom of choice are the authors themes of choice  i certainly have no complaints about the writing which is rich and expressive any quibbles i have say more about me as an easilydistracted reader than they do about dostoevskys incontestable skill as a writer i dare say the novel would be a godsend to a bookworm who has chosen to live offgrid for a month i dont know how long it took dostoevsky to complete this but his writing hand must surely have resembled a sloths claw by the time hed finished it  does the brothers karamazov harbour a captivating story to rival the likes of great expectations or les misrables i think not  is this venerated novel worthy of the widespread admiration it receives absolutely contrary to widespread rumor this is a far from bleak book while every character has his or her own misery and it all takes place in a place called something like cattleroundupville the moments of religious ecstasy and moral clarity are heartbreaking in their frequency  its hard not to wish that one had such bizarre events going on around one in order to prompt such lofty oratory  the story involves ivan dmitri alyosha and smerdyakov four brothers with a rich but notoriously lecherous father fyodor all four brothers were raised by others fyodor having essentially ignored them until others removed them from his care in the beginning of the book alyosha is in the monastery studying under a famous elder name father zosima dmitri has just left the army and stolen a large sum of money from a government officials daughter who he has also apparently seduced all while pursuing a lawsuit against fyodor for his inheritance and canoodling with his own fathers intended the local seductress grushenka ivan the intellectual in the family has just returned from i think petersburg dmitri is violent and impulsive referring to himself as an insect and gets into fistfights with fyodor several times smerdyakov works for fyodor as a lackey having gone to france to learn to cook at some point in the past its unimaginably more complicated and digressive than all this and just trying to follow this crucial sum of three thousand rubles through the story is almost impossible but anyway fyodor is killed and much of the book hinges on which brother killed him and why  when i first read this book in high school my teacher who was a devout catholic a redfaced drunk who wore sunglasses to class and the most enthusiastic reader of russian literature imaginable asked everyone who their favorite brother was was it ivan the tortured skeptic dmitri the scoundrel who tortures himself for every wrong he commits but cant help committing more or alyosha the saintly one who always knows the right thing to say certainly smerdyakov is no ones favorite at the time i went with ivan  i was in high school after all and his atheism and pessimism were revolutionary to me  but now ivan seems rather selfish and callow and i cant help siding with dmitri the one dostoevsky uses almost as a case history of conscience like shakespeare dostoevsky gives his characters all the space to talk like gods clearing pages upon pages for their reasoning and dialog dmitri fumbles with voltaire and is clearly not overly literate but in some ways thats apropos because his main problem is the constant internal conflict between his desires and his ethics which is only partly resolved when he chooses to become responsible for not only what he does but also what he wants  the most famous passage in the book ivans tale of the grand inquisitor is to me far less interesting than zosimas meditations on the conflict between justice and the collective good the elder zosima is a kind of christian socialist who grapples with the typical midth century russian issues of how to build a equitable society without the extremes of coercion that the tsar used to turn to while also ensuring public morality and avoiding the kind of massacres that characterized the french revolution an event that seems to have been even more traumatizing for russians than it was to the french due to the enormous cultural influence france had there at the time zosimas answer is unworkable and in some ways naiive but the discussion is well worth it moreso than ivans somewhat simplistic dualism of christ vs the inquisitor dostoevsky was a cultural conservative in the sense that he was constantly renewing his commitment to the obligations imposed on russians by the orthodox church at the same time he was committed to the pursuit of joy through kindness and community and a kind of interpersonal fair dealing in a way that transcends his political concerns and is inspiring to see articulated in the lives of people who are as confused as the rest of us  its a huge messy book but so worth the effort it took me about three months to read carefully though my reading has been flagging lately as well i read this while listening to hubert dreyfuss accompanying lectures at stanford on existentialism and this book which are available on itunes u and even when i felt his readings overreached it was a good way to reread a tough and subtle work like this in  freud wrote that the brothers karamazov was the most magnificent novel ever written well its possible he had not got round to reading ulysses yet copies were hard to get until  and of course he never did get the opportunity to read the work of dan brown or j k rowling but even so this gives you the idea of this novels impact on the brains of its readers  a summary of the brothers karamazov  the major themes are  comedy tragedy psychology politics theology life death drinking borrowing money  this novel is a shapeshifting beast  for chapters at a time this novel is about children for most of the last half this novel is like a richard price police procedural clockers freedomland lush life and also like a great courtroom drama with verbatim closing speeches elsewhere its a detailed debate about monastic life and the intricacies of the christian message the rest of the time its an intense psychodrama between seven or eight major characters in one chapter an ailing little foot dosto prefigures molly blooms stream of conscious got to say this guy dosto was not a one trick pony not by a country mile  some points about th century russia  only peasants and servants work leaving the rest of the people time to talk a lot  people are really ill quite often this might be connected to the high alcohol consumption or the poor medical facilities  it is clear that the concept of interrupting someone had not yet been introduced into russia at this point so everyone is able to spout forth about anything they like rambling on with multiple digressions for ten pages and none of the other people in the room will say oy shut it sunshine weve heard enough from you let somebody else have a go no one will say this eventually the speaker collapses to the floor from lack of oxygen and the next character will launch into their ten page rant  the narrator is a major character  he is a bumbling old fart who lives in the little town where all this happens he says he has gone round talking to people to get all this story straight he continually says things like the details i do not know  i have heard only that  i myself have not read the will  this arrival of ivan which was so fateful and which was to serve as the origin of so many consequences for me long afterwards the rest of my life almost  and on p  he says  todays item in the newspaper rumours was entitled from skotoprigonyevsk alas that is the name of our town i have been concealing it all this time  there are zingers  you probably thought dosto was a bit gloomy but this is often a comic novel yes really for instance dmitri says  who doesnt wish for his fathers death  everyone wants his father dead  and the narrator himself comes out with  the two were some sort of enemies in love with each other  and ivan says stuff like  when i think of what i would do to the man who first invented god stringing him up on the bitter asp would be too good for him  there is a macguffin  there is an amount of  roubles that dmitri borrows from his current squeeze and readers had better get used to the phrase  roubles popping up about three times on every other page of this  page novel because you see totally coincidentally the dead father was robbed of this exact sum also it can get slightly tiresome i admit that we never hear the last of it  some blurb writers should be stopped before they blurb any more  the blurb on the back of my penguin copy says  the murder of brutal landowner fyodor karamazov changes the lives of his sons blah blah blah  this is likely to get readers all het up and their anticipation of a juicy whodunnit may turn to irritation because the murder doesnt happen until page  this is not dostos fault   all karamazov brothers rated   alexei aka alyosha alyoshka alyoshenka alyoshechka alexeichik lyosha lyoshenka  this is the holy joe novice monk all round too good to be true guy but he doesnt seem to have much vim zip pazzaz or get up and go about him you wouldnt want to be stuck in a lift with him not good boyfriend material   dmitri aka mitya mitka mitenka mitri  this is the roisterdoistering swaggering loudmouth uberromantic aggravating jerk who because of his ability to drink oxstunning amounts of hard liquor and then do the argentinian tango or the viennese waltz at the drop of a samovar is a wow with the ladies but you better be expecting to pay for his exhausting company because he never has a bean except that on the two occasions he does have a bean  beans you will have the best time ever definitely not good boyfriend material   pavel fyodorovich smerdyakov aka the lackey  the unacknowledged bastard of big daddy fyodor who is kept around as a skivvy and although he has brains because hes epileptic and an unacknowledged bastard is never given any education and therefore becomes an autodidact with a full tank of bloodcurdling homicidal suppressed rage hes completely boring until he starts talking then whooahhhhh really not good boyfriend material   ivan aka vanya vanka vanechka  obvious star of the show the fullon atheist and progressive thinker  hes given two entire chapters of brilliant ranting against religion  rebellion and the grand inquisitor and every time he slams into the room and starts sneering the quality of the conversation is going to increase also probably not good boyfriend material  nice bit of dosto meta humour  dmitri gets to make a good joke   eh gentlemen why pick on such little things  how when and why and precisely this much money and not that much and all that claptrap if you keep on itll take you three volumes and an epilogue to cram
The Poisonwood Bible,reviewing in the face of the great billows of love projected towards this novel is a hapless task your hat blows off and your eyes get all teary and if you say one wrong thing small children run out of nowhere and stone you or just bite your calves so i shall this one time sheathe my acid quill but i cant resist just a couple of little points though    you have to suspend great balefuls of disbelief these kids theyre awfully highfalutin with their fancy flora and fauna and fitful forensic philosophising and the mother is worse you can see where they get it from   i dont care for the historical novelfilm cliche where a character rushes in and clues us up to the bigger picture  have you heard sophie war has broken out between the austrohungarian empire and the turks the english fleet has just been sunk the king has fled and we have a new pope why sir marmalade ginrummy you dont say so and how is the queen the queen has syphilis and now barks like a very dog etc etc   for  pages the writing is lovely and the recreation of one tiny corner of the congo convinced me ah if it was only all like that then we could remain friends and there would be no tears before bedtime   after that it goes really wrong i mean seriously   but  pages cant be denied its more than you get from most books a book that countless people told me to read which i finally got round to doing this is a provocative tale about the land that was once called congo the tale of a missionary and his family as told by his  daughters and wife over  years the rise and fall and rise of the price family very interesting in that i get to get a feel some of africas recent colonial past albeit through european eyes a book that definitely stayed with me after completion  out of  my introduction to the fiction of barbara kingsolver is the poisonwood bible her  novel that seems to be a staple of book clubs the world over from oprahs to the dive bar book club ive joined and which picked this as their august read this book was an assignment and took me out of the rhythm i was in reading westerns so that might have something to do with my crankiness and general disappointment of it in summary kingsolver immersed me in extraordinary description materializing the distant world of central africa out of a haze but the book is too long climaxing on page  of  and suffers from a problem of focus  after a dreamy prologue in which a woman in her autumn years named orleanna price looks back on her life while on a beach in georgia the epic begins in the village of kilanga in what was then the nation of congo the year is  the narrative is picked up by one of orleannas four daughters leah who at the age of  begins as perhaps the most devoted to the calling of her father the reverend nathan price a minister who campaigned with the southern baptist mission league and raised tithes from his congregation in bethlehem georgia for the opportunity to relocate his family to the village on the kwilu river and save its souls  the experience of the prices in congo is also related by leahs fearless fiveyearold sister ruth may her crooked spined but sharp minded yearold twin adah and her vapid yearold sister rachel though kilanga once hosted four american missionary families and a doctor the consensus by the baptist couple who greet the prices in leopoldville is that it has fallen on hard times without a white person the last holdout being a catholic missionary named fowles who apparently went native after a raucous reception by the villagers father swings into action planning baptisms in the kwilu and planting a demonstration garden to teach the natives how to grow food  leah recalls not everyone can see it but my fathers heart is as large as his hands and his wisdom is great he was never one of those backwoods ministers who urge the taking up of copperhead snakes babyflinging or the shrieking of nonsense syllables my father believes in enlightenment as a boy he taught himself to read parts of the bible in hebrew and before we came to africa he made us all sit down and study french for the furtherance of our mission he has already been so many places including another jungle overseas in the philippine islands where he was a wounded hero in the second world war so hes seen about everything  the family share their home with a housekeeper whose pleas to father to avoid the poisonwood bush in his garden and to plant in hills instead of rows are ignored brother fowles left them furniture and a parrot named methuselah whose litany of cursesblamed on the catholic missionary but actually due to a despairing orleanna as her efforts to bake rachel a birthday cake in africa failso enrages the reverend that he banishes the bird to nature fathers vision of baptizing the village in the kwilu is mightily rejected a crocodile killed a child on the same spot and word goes out that the white man wants to feed their children to the crocodiles  villagers content with their native gods watch the prices for signs of how powerful jesus is leah nicknamed beene or truth is thrilled when father chooses her to accompany him to leopoldville to witness the countrys independence from belgium ruth may bandu littlest one on the bottom breaks through to the village children by teaching them to play mother may i rachel mvula a pale termite only seen after a rain has her blonde hair yanked by children certain it must be a wig adah benduka crooked walker is so given to wandering off that when blood and the track of a lion are found behind hers the village chief brings news of her demise  leah becomes attracted to a young schoolteacher named anatole who translates the sermons of reverend prize to kikongo when they lose their housekeeper in a row with father over his baptism scheme anatole recommends one of his students an able boy named nelson help out father refuses to heed the calls of their sponsors to leave congo after the belgian handover even when their stipend is cut off mother grows despondent and bedridden and it is left up to the girls to feed the family while father practices his sermons on the lilies when she finally comes out of her stupor orleanna declares she is getting her girls out of here as soon as she finds a way rebellion is in the air  leah recalls all my life ive tried to set my shoes squarely into his footprints believing if only i stayed closed enough to him those same clean simple laws would rule my life as well that the lord would see my goodness and fill me with light yet with each passing day i find myself farther away theres a great holy war going on in my fathers mind in which were meant to duck and run and obey orders and fight for all the right things but i cant always make out the orders or even tell which side i am on exactly im not even allowed to carry a gun im a girl he has no inkling  while leah emerges as the central narrative voice each price woman is given her own perspective in what gradually becomes a story about the assertion of a womans independence from the male authority figure dictating her existence a decent amount of suspense is generated as that battle culminates kingsolver who in preparations for her page novel never set foot in what was known from  to  as zaire due to travel restrictions of the mobutu regime is a language artist first and foremost her descriptions of the congo are vividhissing smoking and at times overwhelming the senses before exploding like a multitude of fireworks  it was hot that day in a season so dry our tongues went to sleep tasting dust and woke up numb our favorite swimming holes in the creek which should have been swirling with fast brown water this time of year were nothing but dry cradles of white stones women had to draw drinking water straight from the river while they clucked their tongues and told stories of women fallen to crocodiles in other dry years which were never as dry as this one the manioc fields were flat dead fruit trees barren yellow leaves were falling everywhere littering the ground like a carpet rolled out for the approaching footsteps of the end of time the great old kapoks and baobabs that shaded our village ached and groaned in their branches they seemed more like old people than plants  moving down the list from language artist kingsolver may be a historian geographer and storyteller in that order that should be reversed theres a lack of focus that grew thicker the more i read i didnt mind jumping from the head of one price woman to the other but the flaw of the novel is that rather lock on a damn good storya familys revolt against a dictatorial patriarchit gets lost in trying to tell the impressions of a familys thirty years in africa the latter is nowhere near as compelling as the former the novel climaxes on page  and keeps kept throwing description for another  pages its too much table dressing and not enough meal for me i read the poisonwood bible for two reasons because ive always wanted to read a barbara kingsolver book and i am intrigued by secular takes on christianity in modernday writings  i just finished it today it is the story of a missionary familys trek to the congo told through the eyes of the four daughters and their mother the father is a misguided preacher who is trying to escape past demons by forcefeeding christ to a culture that he has neither researched nor desires to understand the name of the book is a reference to his misuse of the native language  so instead of calling the bible something holy hes referring to it as a poisonous tree  all in all i am glad i read the book  the discussion of the congos tumultuous history and the commentary on how the united states and various european nations have tried and failed to control something so wild and free was very interesting it is a theme i saw repeatedly play out in this book  when peoplenations are unwilling to take the time to understand where others are coming from be it individuals or people groups the result is longrunning anguish regret and the destruction of lives and families the writing can be very good  the death of one of the daughters which is disclosed early in the novel although she is not identified had me literally weeping over this book  that all said there were parts of the book that dragged for me  and the whole catalyst for why these four girls and their mother were transplanted to africa a highly controlling husbandfather was never completely resolved to my satisfaction he sort of disappears in to the jungle halfway through the book never to return  from a christian standpoint i was also disappointed in how missionaries were generally portrayed  selfseeking greedy and biblethumping morons who were either frothing at the mouth or couldnt get out of the country fast enough when the going got tough there were also doctrinal errors i spent several years as a baptist and i never attended a church that believed baptism was a necessary ticket in to heaven  quite the contrary actually  it would have been a fascinating foil to have a truly christfocused godseeking missionary family in these peoples midsts  while i appreciate how the only good missionary in this book didnt completely reject god his buffetstyle approach to what he accepteddiscarded about the bible was disturbing yet it was clearly held up as the preferred example for the rest of characters in the book  stars this book had moments of perfection in its poetic prose  star quality to sections of the most horrible chicklit  star quality  the narrative of the congo was fascinating both historically and anthropologically at times i felt connected to the collective unconscious the hunt scene as well as the death of ruth may come to mind as examples of this  the individual voices of the price girls and even less so the price women when they grew updid not ring true and i feel strongly that this book would have been much more powerful written in the third person  i am perplexed that a book that at times reached the pinnacle of literary wonder could rapidly deteriorate to trite vacuous melodrama  i am certainly glad that i finally read this novel and am open to trying another novel by this author as when it was good it soared this is one of those books i wasnt in love with but completely understood why others would be i dislike religious people am appalled by the existence of missionaries and as each awful event occurred found myself wishing that far far worse would happen to these awful spiritual colonialists kingsolvers book about a missionary family in the congo could have been two separate booksone fiction the other nonfiction sadly the poisonwood bible was a combination of both which resulted in a story a bit longinthetooth there is something distinct and refreshing about the short simple sometimes lyrical sentences in this book and wow what a story the angle the story took of a postcolonial african country was also interesting the remorse and reflection was illuminating something that nonfiction from similar settings and era really fail to do  the story takes place in the former belgian congo also formerly the republic of congo then zaire and now the drc democratic republic of the congo the political setting is the reign of the authoritarian mobutu and the events leading up to getting the country from colony to democratic country while also painting the picture of postcolonial educationor the lack thereofand how that played an important role in rectifying political turmoil  the angle of the missionary family was a good addition to a familiar story the missionary dad in this family resembles the dad in purple hibiscus and the smell of apples  oppressive controlling devoid of reason the family of six dad mom and four girls leave their home in america and settle in rural africa within a small village that hasnt yet caught up with the modern world and this dad is somehow tricked into believing that he is the superior power sent to rule the inferior africans you can only imagine where the story goes from there i must say i saw bits and pieces of things fall apart in this work  there is some melancholy and beauty though the book feels as if it could have been a hundred pages shorter there were five narrators all who were supposed to have different styles and voices yet at times they blended together into the voice of an overall arching narrator at times adah one of my favorite narrators started to sound like an older woman and not the young girl she was supposed to be the history of the congo was muddled in certain places and with five narrators it was just hard to keep excited i ended up growing to like leah and anatoles characters better because of the purpose their juxtaposed relationship seemed to fill within the bigger narrative rating this was difficult because instinctively i wanted to give it five stars because it so irritated a certain conservative christian anti communist lobby who so irritate me however i couldnt because the characters were just so unbelieveable that i think they would have been dead within a month my background means i have come across this sort of missionary who wanders off to another culture because the lord has called them to spread the word with no regard to local custom or belief but the price family were a spectacularly disasterous example even by those standards and to the old belgian congo as well i had real prtoblems suspending belief i think the book is so well known that i dont need to outline the story having said all of that the book is well written the characters do have a spark the real star is africa and the backdrop the historical events surrounding the departure of the belgians the election of lumumba and his cia inspired murder i felt the book lost its way when things started to go badly wrong electing to use the voices of the four daughters and occasionally the mother was an interesting ploy but i really wanted to hear the interior dialogue of nathan price who was by far the most interesting character because he was by far the most flawed an easy enough read but just too unbelieveable the juxtaposition of the price family and their new setting was just too sharp and lacking in nuance the author was also way too preachy even though i agreed with her  i liked it a pretty good book which gives a very clear picture of africa through the s s and s with a strong focus on the evils of white colonialism i could have done without the multiple pov chapters  this irritates me at the best of times although i admit it can work well sometimes in this book i though it was unnecessary to hear the different povs of the four children and wife of nathan price an evangelist preacher missionary to the congo in  if you do have to have chapters from their pov make them third person apparently a  year old can write or have an internal monologuediaryjournal that reads like an adults thoughts and a yo has annoying grammatical errors and uses incorrect words like a  year old  this persists till the end of the book when she is  having said that it does tell a great story which really captures the everyday life of africa through the eyes of an american family who go to stay for a year but never really leave worth reading overall i was not engaged by this novel the latter half was far better than the beginning half  and also the book is much too long plus  pages  the story is written from the point of view of five family members  a mother and her four daughters  who are attempting to adjust to the vicissitudes of life in the congo i had to almost force myself to continue reading in the first part of the story the pace was tedious consisting mostly of settings in the small remote village they were living in i also found it very claustrophobic and unreal  the author for the most part focused solely on the family  the price family  mother four daughters and especially the father more on him later in a small village that undoubtedly would have loads of children this newly arrived family would be inundated by swarms of visitors  both young and old the price family would have little time to think about themselves but in the first half we are presented with the price family as if they were marooned on a remote island all by themselves for example the eldest daughter is harassed by the village children about her blonde hair  but this idea of an interaction with the village out there is not expounded on when the youngest daughter of the price family dies the villagers come to mourn we are told that prior some  to  children had died since the arrival of the price family  which begs the question of what was the price family doing when these tragic deaths happened  really the first half of the book and possibly more is consumed with father he is fervent evangelical who can only speak using biblical quotations as one of his children states at the end of the book he was a despicable father that is true but i found the theme of the mad bad daddy way overstated and it became repetitive i found daddy price to be a caricature  and i was starting to wonder if the author had a fatherdaddy complex in many ways this is a book much more about father than the congo  i actually found the last hundred pages of how each family member coped with the post traumatic stress of the congo to be the most interesting part of the book   as a warning there are a lot of biblical passages in the book well i should have expected that given the title this was really wellwritten but i wasnt in the mood for it three stars for now but probably if i had been in the mood it would have been four stars so lets split the difference  the poisonwood bible is an important book one that is probably good for everyone to read and think about it the book follows the story of the price family the father nathan is a baptist preacher whose gotten it in to his head to save the souls of the entirety of africa with just his bare hands and hes taken his family a wife and four daughters with him the book is narrated by the four daughters with little section prologues narrated by their mother from a distant time in the future the book is long but not a page of it is wasted kingsolver uses those pages to show us the human arrogance of not just the price family but the ways humans can change or not change over time the congolese setting is key as its set during the time of transition from corrupt belgian rule to the early days of independence in many ways the journey of the price family mirrors what is going on in the country as a whole  i wish i would have read this book when i was in the mood for it but its not a fun book or a pleasant book there are rare moments of levity but mostly this a quiet long contemplative book that requires thought and patience and is not here to entertain having to put up with the figure of nathan price for hundreds of pages felt like hard work i probably should have scheduled out time to read it at a slower pace instead of cramming it into two days  maybe ill try again some other time i am tired of people coming after rachel price and calling her an opportunist who has  husbands wow do i love the specific hypocrisy of that statement rachel price is conniving manipulative selfish and with every reason to be rachel is not a daisy who wants security and love and money so she wont take a risk with gatsby no rachel is a character who is reared in an environment with a crazy father a mother who only considers herself a mother to her youngest daughter and shes thrown into this culture shock of the congo as a typically selfish teenager i ask you to cut rachel price at the beginning of the story some slack think of yourself as a seventeen year old were you out there dying to give up every tiny ounce of luxury to go spread your fathers crazy interpretation of faith in the congo probably not realize too how much weight all teenagers put on beauty and status rachel enters the congo as any privileged teenager would ignorant selfish and materialistic welcome to the world in which rachel price begins as your tropey popular girl and remember that she is not an anomaly in that sense we all forget most often at rachels age that the world doesnt revolve around us   five marriages furthermore yes transition words are necessary when your ted talk gets this serious for all of the people out there attacking rachel for her numerous marriages i ask yall to remember how marriage was first introduced to her when tata ndu asks for her hand in marriage rachel is introduced to the marriage to eeben axelroot as a way out of a tough situation rachel is seventeen still some of us learn at that age that speeding gets us a ticket rachel learns that tough situations can be fixed by marriage to a man of power so when rachel goes on to leave eeben i say you go girl he was verbally abusive  he said my brain was such a blank slate he could tell me every state secret he knows and then march me straight down to the damnistry international and not have a thing to worry aboutthis is not lovelydovey quarreling mind you he says these things and laughs in my face oh i have cried till i threatened to ruin my own complexion let me tell you  given this i really cant understand peoples issue with rachel and her multiple marriages she sees these issues in her life heeds to her knowledge that marriage is a way out of a situation and she does what she can to survive  when the ants come wow this is where the rachel price deserves better argument gets tough to listen to if your opinion is already firm how can one justify the fact that when faced with a dire situation rachel as the oldest sister chooses not to save her bible or her siblings but her mirror im gonna put in a quote here because though its irrelevant man is it gold  not my clothes there wasnt time and not the bible it didnt seem worth saving at that moment so help me god it had to be my mirror  this girl found zero comfort in her family her mom orleanna was occupied with a toxic relationship to nathan and an identityconsuming mother role only to ruth may saving the mirror at first glance is so gross its the purest form of selfishness but remember how the price family came to the congo they literally had material goods strapped to all parts of them so when these material goods suddenly become rare in the congo rachel focuses all of her energy on acquiring them rachel so badly wants to come out unscathed and unchanged by her experiences in the congo so she takes her once innocent materialism and sinks farther into it until it is all consuming i wont excuse her blatant racism but i wont tolerate any more attacks on my girl rachel price for her selfishness rachel found a way to look out for herself when no one else would do we really want to attack her for that rachel entered the congo as a typically selfish teen and in her effort to leave the congo just as she entered some of her once innocent faults develop into complete vices she marries to escape puts more value in materials than family and as a result she develops from an ignorant teen to a grown woman surrounded by poverty and oppression with concern only for herself im not saying she deserves your sympathy her descent into vice and selfishness was a continuous choice but she deserves more than to be cast off as vain because really in case of emergency rachel can be found saving only one thing from destruction her mirror and in that mirrors reflection herself suddenly her vanity doesnt seem so onedimensional this was an interesting book with much cultural insensitivity and many misrepresentations of the christian faith  all of which made me cringe told from the points of view of the  price girls and their mother who moved to the congo as missionaries with their fatherhusband the different characters of the girls amused me  especially rachel the eldest with her incorrect usage of words most of which i cant remember as i listened to the book and didnt make notes  the narrative was something i was not certain i would like initially  i felt like the narrator dean robertson a female was rushing and this was a book that needed some time to take things in in my opinion so i could have done with the narrator reading a bit more slowly she also read in a fairly flat monotone  there was some expression there but not as much as i felt the story warranted however i got used to all this and mostly enjoyed the narration in the end  there were some fantastic quotes in this book  sometimes instances of where nathan price was so horribly misguided in his beliefs sometimes views of life from the girls which made me chuckle sometimes observations which were just so apt for describing life in africa i think ill have to read this book properly sometime so that i can write them down  it was a heavy and intense book where many mistakes were made and there was a lot of sadness and regret for what might have been but it was wellwritten and a good read im a high school english teacher who had just read and taught chinua achebes things fall apart to my students and was drawn to this book for the obvious parallels the bottom line  i liked this book but i felt as others that towards the end i was being browbeaten with the plight of the zaireans and the us role in ignoring their predicament its the same tale today looking at rwanda and darfur i suppose there are others who arent aware but i am i get it okay the us never does enough unless there is a vested interest i get that i just didnt like being told it over  over  over particularly though leahs dialogue i appreciate passion and kingsolver obviously has passion but sometimes when youre overpassionate you lose the audience and thats how i felt loved the lyrical prose loved the first  pages told through the women loved to hate nathan price and i loved to hear of both the positive and negatives of missionaries in africa loved that it was balanced in showing both the good and bad in all people sort of a message that there are both yin  yan in all races and cultures i particularly enjoyed orleannas voice which was silent except in retrospect and that was particularly clever and enjoyable i think its a lovely wellwritten book that i would definitely recommend particularly if you enjoyed things fall apart or similar books this was seriously messed up i was cheering for the ant swarm to eat everyone in the village so the story could end  ive always been curious if your basic missionaries are this insane or uneducated probably some  so here we have daddy missionary nathan who takes his wife and  daughters to the african congo to save the poor villagers from some kind of voodoo i guess but it turns out hes an illadvised nutter who isnt the slightest bit interested in different cultures and languages mostly he just wants to throw some king james english at them and save their heathen souls im pretty sure this has happened factually a time or two  this is a great character study though we get the story through the voices of the  women mom tries hard but is sick of all the crap and abuse oldest daughter is a typical vain blond teenage beauty queen i liked her then there were twin geniuss  one with only half her body functioning and last we have little ruth  there was no real christianity anywhere in this book just confused white people with some supernatural assumptions and half learned sunday school lessons later we get to meet some liberal christians who arent much better slightly smarter than our heroes though im not sure if kingsolver was even trying to make a religious point if she was then she failed this appeared to be more of a character study and family dynamics drama  the obvious point of this book seems to be how freakin abusive daddy nathan is yes hes a religious tyrant and official whacko fundamentalist but if you look closely  you get to see the numerous flaws of the five girls as the story goes on you get to see the girls make numerous decisions that equal daddy dearest mommy runs back to america and tries to ignore everything the oldest daughter makes the best of where she ends up and lives quite selfishly one becomes a knowitall of a successful career another spends her years and family trying to save africa from itself and endlessly puts her family in danger doing it  and then theres the crazy village people no not the band we have witch doctors and crooked politicians and supernatural oppression  and endless bullying yes stuff we all have in common  no matter how much electricity and luxuries we embrace  all i can say is the ant attack on the village is like nothing i have ever read before how do you tell a missionary family to prepare for something like that i think ill be a missionary in vegas  some book reviewers have wisely commented that there are many better missionary tales with better history and african culture but this is fiction after all i guess thats what you get for taking your mind into the congo  was a depressing though educative and thought provoking read on congo now reborn as zaire the central characters are a priest his wife and  daughters who come to the poverty ridden backyards of congo with the sole intention of converting idol worshippers to christianity the father is a zealot the rest are sort of puppets on strings pulled and controlled by him they end up losing more than they bargained for the book takes us through the religious and social customs and beliefs of christiandom as well as indigenous religion it was a minestrone of information and i learnt a lot including politics of s to s the last  was insufferable as it attempted to tie down the events at a racing pace while the initial three fourths covered events in the span of a couple of years the last quarter raced past  decades this disparity affected the initial smooth flow and cost this book the  stars which the initial half had earned this was unfortunately not something i really loved it was good the writing was great i didnt get into the story like i wanted to shrug i finally finished this bookmixed feeling as the first  was a tedious read but the last  absolutely fascinating i loved reading how their experiences as children in africa impacted their later lives  at its best the poisonwood bible is a wellresearched gripping read set during the waning hours of the belgian congo it successfully builds out life as experienced by a family of american missionaries in the village of kilanga it weaves in a number of satisfying motifs that complement the central message of the story  unfortunately due to her zeal in getting this message across barbara kingsolver renders her characters incredibly onenote each intended to fulfill a telegraphed purpose in her tale they all essentially possess a single trait and ms kingsolver isn
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (Maya Angelou's Autobiography, #1)",my mother could never really speak to me about the abuse she suffered as a little girl  the closest we came to talking about her experiences occurred when we read this painful and important book together i imagine that mayas book has allowed countless women who have suffered similar horrors an opportunity to know they will never be alone in their pain and perhaps like my mother an opportunity to begin to heal by sharing their story with a loved one  rip maya your words have made this planet a better place if only the rest of us could be half as decent as you  lyrical poignant honest stars    honorable mention read  this was a wonderfully written beginning to ms angelous six volume autobiography i had been wanting to read this for many years and jeans gorgeous review pushed me over the edge to add this to my shortlist  ms angelous writing appears effortless and clear the emotions and honesty ring through and you walk alongside her childhood and feel for her pain enjoy her laughs and cheer her on her adventures  i love that she portrays herself with her anger alongside her compassion and speaks honestly about sexual abuse abandonment poverty race relations jealousy desire perseverance and a deep and uncompromising individuality  i will leave you with one of her painful rants about her race and the race of others  it was awful to be negro and have no control over my life it was brutal to be young and already trained to sit quietly and listen to charges brought against my color with no chance of defense we should all be dead i thought i should like to see us all dead one on top of the other a pyramid of flesh with the whitefolks on the bottom as the broad base then the indians with their silly tomahawks and teepees and wigwams and treaties the negroes with their mops and recipes and cotton sacks and spirituals sticking out of their mouths the dutch children should all stumble in their wooden shoes and break their necks the french should choke to death on the louisiana purchase  while silkworms ate all the chinese with their stupid pigtails as a species we were an abomination all of us    i look forward to reading the second volume at some point  rest in peace ms angelou and bless you for your contributions to poetry and race relations  my tears were not for bailey or mother or even myself but for the helplessness of mortals who live on the sufferance of life  how apt are these words and how true they ring people really do take their lives for granted it is of course a suffering from birth to death we should be shedding tears for the complete ignorance we carry ourselves for the reality the world offers which we fail to see yet is it worth it all those tears  it would be considered in a certain fact that reading this book during the current turbulent days is certainly fitting in a certain manner but some might think one is trying to be part of something they are not truth be told being a brown girl as weve been constantly labeled in a brown country surrounded by the ocean and other brown countries i personally have not faced racism in fact i have been brought up in my own cocoon i am part of the majority that inhabit our tiny island thus i have not received any judgement from any the first time i felt out of my box was around  years ago i was in italy happily travelling by train from milan to switzerland when a certain italian boy was curiously looking at me i thought i was mistaken and ignored it later it came to my attention that he went as far as pointing at me and telling something to his mother me with zero knowledge of that language just smiled at him i did not suspect anything until my aunt came to me and turned me away from them and took me away from there and told to just ignore them although she did not explicitly mention what was conversed between mother and child i knew it was nothing good this was my first time i ever felt as if i was an alien in another planet it was the first time i felt as i was not accepted although this was for a very brief moment i felt a certain level of sadness not anger but sadness not even knowing what they were saying i felt that i was accused of a crime i cannot even help now that i read this book i cannot even fathom what colored people let them be black brown or yellow feel at a regular basis  now that i have called myself brown and given the term yellow and black to others what do i really try to achieve am i not putting the same labels that they have forced upon us at times looking at the situation in the world a certain fear runs through my blood would we be next will there be a day that all colored people would be washed out of the world reasons are truly unfathomable for me so many questions run through my mind when i see the blatant disgust people have towards each other  why are we dirty  black brown yellow why are we so different from them  at the end arent we all the same  strip us down to the bones wont we all be the same  arent we all made of the same tiny atoms  it is not that i am trying to bring up an argument by raising these questions neither am i accusing anyone but in the end there is a certain kind of sadness that courses through my blood no one deserves this why is it that even almost a century after these happening in the book that we have not changed at all  i will admit that i am speaking about things in general rather than book here but i do not think there is much to say about this maya angelou has proven herself worthy of the praise i am only sad that i did not pick this book up earlier i do not know if it was the captivating words or lilting prose in the book but i truly felt as if i was in the embrace of a motherly bosom and listening to a fairytale while i was reading this it truly captivated me and sent me to another realm the story started with a simple yet small girl and ended with that small girl becoming woman when she was not a woman at all at times i felt anger towards my own ignorance of the world and at time i felt anger at the world in general but i can easily discern that this book really was an eye opener and it truly did change my world in the end i was not left with that anger but a bitter sadness in my heart will it ever end  all asked the same questions how long oh god how long i was sitting on a bench as i enjoyed the last bits of warm sunlight the dying summer was oozing out scrutinizing a newspaper while calculatedly assuming a thoughtful gaze  this little girl ran up to me she said mister mister i know why the caged bird sings  i looked up from reading the financial news thats great kid now run along cant you see im busy  i turned back to reading on how poorly the economy was doing theres nothing like reading bad news to feed the intellect  but mister mister the caged bird sings and i know why i know why ladida ladidoo and so should you  she skipped and danced excitedly a bunch of people were standing around bestowing benign smiles on the girl and throwing eager looks in my direction as an emphatic plea to hear her out i heaved a sigh put down the paper and said  alright little one tell me all about that bird of yours  so she started talking about her grandmother momma how strong she was about her momma mother dear such a beautiful lady about handsome and kind brother bailey and big and absent father bailey about her little life in a little corner of a little shop the corner despite its size offers the perfect vantage point to see what goes on in that big world and in the little minds that inhabit it she tells excitedly of her sweet childhood memories and shares her keen observations she offers an insiders view on a part of the world a part of society i was completely unfamiliar with id heard about cotton pickers of course i saw them depicted in popular culture but what i saw through her tales were not mere depictions but real life people worn out by the burdens of their tasks i saw their fatigue through the small spasms of pain surrounding their lips and quavering shoulders the absence of the glint in their eyes as they were telling their jokes but even as i looked into this unknown world many of it felt familiar to me and i realised that this unknown world is my world our world only theres this wall who put that stupid thing there the little girl showed me the window in that wall and her generous spirit has left it wide open as the breeze of her story wafted through it  i willed her to keep talking and she did with passion and patience  suddenly the girl stopped dancing looking down at the ground she said with a voice as tiny as a cats whisker a big man hurt me real bad  she looked up the playful twinkle was gone i was ready to stand up hold her in my arms and tell her things would be fine her eyes defiant filled with pride and intelligence told me she would have none of that she started dancing again slowly and more deliberately  more memories ensued the tale matured into one dealing with one of societys biggest embarrassments of black people not being allowed to work on tramcars of dentists not wanting to treat little children with a specific ethnic background but despite the enormity of all this humiliation the little girl kept center stage through her courage wit and wisdom her pace quickened and i heard a melody of personal memories powerful anecdotes and fiery statements of indignation  she sang the house was smudged with unspoken thoughts  a bit later she said the unsaid words pushed roughly against the thoughts that we had no craft to verbalize and crowded the room to uneasiness  her apparent eloquence made the melodious statement all the more profound  the need for change bulldozed a road down the center of my mind  my relief melted my fears and they liquidly stole down my face  and then a momentous description of the wall of racism the girl just told me about how a lady receptionist wouldnt allow her to file a candidacy for a job she was coveting the reasons were hidden yet obvious the girl then sang  the miserable little encounter had nothing to do with me the me of me any more than it had to do with that silly clerk the incident was a recurring dream concocted years ago by stupid whites and it eternally came back to haunt us all the secretary and i were like hamlet and laertes in the final scene where because of harm done by one ancestor to another we were bound to duel to the death also because the play must end somewhere i went further than forgiving the clerk i accepted her as a fellow victim of the same puppeteer  i was awestruck but she was obviously waiting for me to say something  what a wonderful tale youre giving that clerk an easy pass there but im sure that once youre a bit older youll reconsider this imagery however beautiful it is but how about that bird little girl you didnt mention it let alone the reasons for its singing  i aint no little girl no more mister  and with that she stomped off in a fit of pique and out of my sight  i wonder if ill ever see her again i sure hope so i want to know about that bird im quite ashamed that its taken me this long to read this book maya angelou is so inspirational to many people so reading about her childhood and adolescence was really special i found her autobiography tragic and also hopeful at the same time things have changed a lot since angelous childhood such as segregation and colourism in the black community to an extent the fact that she went through that period of history and is alive to see the first black president in us history is just wonderful maya angelou ends her story of her youth with the birth of her son and that is a fitting ending for with a child comes an adults responsibilities although she was only a teenager when she had him and had only had one very hasty and unsatisfying almost impersonal sexual experience to gain that son it feels a bit abrupt when you are reading it i had a son the end  she had a disjointed upbringing with much movement between households all over the country ending up in san francisco by way of the deep south and other states along the way her mother and father divorced early and her first memories are of her fathers mother who raised her she and her brother bailey were moved to st louis to her mothers mothers house then she moved with her mother brother and a mr freeman to an apartment in st louis since her mother was out working a lot mr freeman sexually assaulted her and eventually raped her she was  little girls and boys left alone with boyfriends often suffer this way in this case she did eventually tell on him and there was a trial and he was found guilty but only served one day in jail he was found dead shortly after angelou thinks her uncles killed him  she loses her voice then literally and doesnt speak for years she says its because her speaking made a man lose his life but maybe part of the reason was because she was traumatized and angry and she knew her relatives resented her for becoming a different child afterwards sullen and sad and they expected her to get over it and move on her silence was the answer to that  this is a moving memoir and very dark and she does move on because she has to or give up she turns to school and the power of words when nudged in that direction by a few gentle angels she meets along the way teachers and good neighbors who bring light to the darkness honest story inspiring  childhood memories living in arkansas with grandmother later in st louis with mother sexual abuse when she was eight years old brother bailey there love and support hopes for the future back to san francisco with mother questioning herself about her sexuality she was the first africanamerican to be hired to work on the the transportation department at the age of seventeen i know why the caged bird sings was maya angelous first book and as i was reading i recognized how revolutionary it must have been when it was released there was and still is a whole world of people with little conception of what southern rural black people went through before and during the civil rights movement and while ive read more on this topic than some i would include myself in that number so seeing that time and place reflected here has undeniably been extremely valuable for manyboth those who lived it and those who did not in addition her depiction of the events and emotions leading up to and following her childhood rape was quite striking and must have been astoundingly groundbreaking when it first appeared in print i could also see quite clearly how this memoir has influenced subsequent generations of writers and filmmakers its importance cannot be overstated as a reading experience however it was a bit more mixed for me some of the writing was beautiful and vivid with a strong sense of place and character but some was a little more rough and choppy and the episodic nature of the book didnt work particularly well in my opinion for a first book these are forgivable flaws and i would never discourage anyone from reading this memoirin fact i think everyone should read it but for me what it mainly did was make me want to read angelous later books where presumably she gains full possession of the writerly powers beginning to emerge here i know why the caged bird sings is a personal account told in the voice of a child cleverly reconstructed by an adult narrator through the observations of maya the child comes a comingofage story  a social record of a young black female growing up in the s as an historical document caged bird covers the bigotry cruelty oppression and the constant threat of death that constituted daily life in the south  the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom  the autobiography is also a representation that can be read as a feminist observation the black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice white illogical hate and black lack of power maya was fortunate to have the unbending support from strong financially independent nononsense women like momma her paternal grandmother who owned land and a grocery business her mother vivian who owned a gambling hall and even her politically wellplaced octoroon maternal grandmother baxter all whose convictions not to be dependent on men provided maya with the foundation on which to build her selfassurance  but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing  more significantly after the violent traumatic and pivotal experience of her young life from which she loses her speech we are reminded that abject struggle often precede success it is through her strong willed teacher mrs flowers that maya finds confidence self worth and retrieves from imprisonment her voice the last part of mayas journey through adolescence is poignant in the mother daughter  infant visual and although she is still uncertain and insecure she receives the promise of maturity mother whispered see you dont have to think about doing the right thing if youre for the right thing then you do it without thinking  the free bird thinks of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawnbright lawn and he names the sky his own  maya angelou eloquently articulated how the painful struggles and scattered happy experiences of growing up in the south had a significant role in the shaping of the gifted outspoken determined inspirational person she became  the free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wings in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky  i know why the caged bird sings is the first in the magnificent sixvolume autobiography of maya angelou april   may

woman capable of responding to prejudice in her nonfiction autobiography maya angelou describes her life from her young girl life up to the birth of her first child at age  the book drew me in at the very beginning because of the talent angelou has with language scenery and loading the moment with emotion another intense draw for me was the fact that it is a nonfiction book i was constantly thinking i cant believe she had these experiences  spoiler alertwhen maya turned three she and her brother bailey went to live with her grandmother in arkansas because of her mothers divorce they worked doing strenuous everyday chores and the grandmother referred to by the children as momma instilled in them religion and values when maya was eight and bailey nine they went to live with their mother in california they loved knowing who their mother was finallya beautiful successful hardworking woman soon however maya was raped by her mothers live in boyfriend after being on the witness stand in court maya was terrified what would happen to her brother because of the threats that he mentioned about killing bailey if she spoke to anyone about what happened maya didnt have to worry about this for long however because the perpetrator was killed a few nights later the children were placed in a pingpong game of having to move to different places and learn to adjust throughout their difficult circumstances the pingpong game was relevant to more than moving their emotions and identities seemed to follow the same pattern  i loved this book although it has been censored and banned from schools and classrooms quite often because of the issues illustrated in the book i think that this book would be most effective for students who are juniors or seniors in high school or older angelou had a difficult life with challenges beyond what i can wrap my mind around and her blunt honesty tells it how it was this fact was both hard and captivating the book should be read by parents before handed down to teens but if discussed properly it has the potential for many teaching and learning opportunities the book discusses graphic and disturbing conflicts in the book including but not limited to the following racial prejudice and violence sexual abuse violence language prostitution and an unwanted pregnancy if discussed properly the book would provide a great learning experience for both student and teacher as discovery occurs in this touching and tragic comingofage autobiography maya angelou lays it all out there for everyone to see her challenging roller coaster of a life from age  while descriptively graphic in detail the memoir also exhibits bits of humor in the narrative i found maya to be a kind intelligent and courageous young girl despite her navet and very fortunate to have a loving grandmother momma and brother momma really was a tough ole bird too the outcome of her encounter with dentist lincoln is hysterical both mayas imaginary version and what actually occurred perhaps not a novel for all ages but definitely a memorable classic what can i even say maya angelou was an incredible woman and this was such a poignant and moving window into the world of the difficulties that come with growing up as a black woman in the south maya underwent unspeakable horrors yet found the strength she needed to overcome each and every one of them  there were a few little essays here and there that i wasnt entirely sure fit the memoir as a whole but for the most part i was completely enraptured by her words u born marguerite annie johnson in  was an africanamerican poet singer actress writer director producer composer and civil rights activist this first book of angelous sevenpart autobiography covers her childhood and adolescence up to the age of seventeen  angelou had a turbulent childhood beginning with her parents divorce when she was three years old at that time marguerite and her beloved fouryearold brother bailey were sent from their fathers home in california to stamps arkansas to live with their paternal grandmother annie henderson   little marguerite annie johnson   map showing stamps arkansas  stamps was a southern town and angelou notes in stamps the segregation was so complete that most black children didnt really absolutely know what whites looked like unfortunately marguerites limited interaction with the racist white population made an everlasting impression on her    marguerite and baileys grandmother whom the children called momma was an entrepreneur she owned a plot of land and lived in her shop called the store which sold food and candy to the negro population of stamps  momma was strict and marguerite and bailey were expected to go to school do their homework finish their chores and help in the store before going out to play or perusing their books the children were avid readers who knew their multiplication tables by heart thanks to crippled uncle willie  who tested them regularly marguerites favorite treats from the shop were foil covered chocolate kisses and canned pineapple  which was a very rare treat      momma was a devout christian who prayed each morning and took the children to church every sunday in addition momma periodically hosted reverend howard thomas elder thomas who presided over the local church district elder thomas visited stamps every few months and ate and slept at mommas house marguerite and bailey disliked the man because he was big and pompous and prayed so long over breakfast that the food became cold and congealed  marguerite became anxious when she had an errand in the white part of town because she was frightened of whites  who disdained and mistreated negroes this impudent attitude even extended to white trash youngsters who  when they bought snacks in mommas store  were rude and insolent once when a few shabby grimecovered little white girls made fun of momma marguerite was reduced to tears  stamps was especially dangerous for black men who were in constant danger of being lynched    when a friendly sheriff came by to warn momma that a group of white men was looking for a black troublemaker grandmother hid disabled uncle willie deep under the produce in a vegetable bin it was good that the white men didnt come by because uncle willie moaned loudly all night  all this prejudice and hatred had a profound impact on young marguerite who sometimes fantasized that she was a pretty white girl with silky blonde hair  when marguerite was eight her father came to get her and bailey and brought them to their mother vivian in st louis missouri marguerite didnt want to go but upon arrival was charmed by her beautiful vivacious mother dear unlike momma vivian smoked laughed joked danced and made parties   vivian baxter maya angelous mother  young marguerite who had nightmares would sometimes sleep with vivian and her boyfriend mr freeman unfortunately  when vivian left for work  mr freeman would touch marguerite inappropriatelyand he eventually raped her mr freeman threatened yearold marguerite with dire consequences if she told anyone so the terrified child kept mum   marguerite at age nine  vivian found out anyway which resulted in an arrest a trial and extreme vigilante justice by marguerites uncles afterwards marguerite and bailey were sent back to stamps but the girl was so freaked out  thinking her testimony had led to mr freemans death  that she stopped speaking for several years  it took finesse  and books  from a caring educator called mrs bertha flowers to get marguerite talking again and perhaps to foster the girls interest in a literary career  before leaving stamps for good marguerite had another unpleasant encounter with a white person marguerites habit of sneaking candy bars from mommas store resulted in horrific tooth decay and an excruciating toothache  so bad that marguerite hoped the house would collapse on her jaw  there was no black dentist in stamps so momma took marguerite to the white dentist dr lincoln  who had borrowed money from grandmother during the depression dr lincoln didnt even look at the suffering child and told momma id rather stick my hand in a dogs mouth than in a nrs grandmother then shamed  dollars of interest out of the nasty man and took marguerite to a negro dentist in texarkana  a few years later after teenage bailey was horrified by the bloated body of a negro killed by whites momma decided the children had to leave stamps for good grandmother made sure the children got settled with their mother in san francisco where glamorous vivian ran gambling clubs hung out with a wild crowd and lived with her beau and later husband daddy clidell unlike mr freeman daddy clidell was a fine man who was good to marguerite  marguerite continued attending school and  at  years of age  became the first black conductress on the streetcars of san francisco to get the job marguerite claimed to be  and lobbied hard for weeks showing the mettle that served her so well in life   conductress marguerite  afterwards during a summer visit with her father bailey sr and his girlfriend dolores in southern california marguerite had a wild adventure in mexico marguerite and her dad went across the border to buy tortillas and  after a raucous night of drinking and philandering  bailey sr was completely knocked out marguerite loaded him into the back seat of their car and  though shed never driven before  transported bailey sr  miles down the mountain before she had a minor accident  this incident was followed by a physical altercation with dads jealous girlfriend dolores who cut marguerite badly teenage marguerite then ran away and lived on the streets of southern california for a month where she made friends with other homeless kids and slept in junkyard cars finally marguerite returned to san francisco to continue school  meanwhile bailey jr  observing his mothers unconventional lifestyle and feeling jealous of her zootsuited friends  started acting out he became surly took up with an old prostitute and acted like he was a big man  though he was only  this got bailey jr thrown out of the housemuch to marguerites dismay   man wearing a zoot suit  lack of proper sex education left marguerite confused about her sexuality and physical changes in her vagina made the girl think she might be becoming a lesbian to put the matter to rest yearold marguerite seduced a handsome young neighbor boyand promptly became pregnant  marguerites mom vivian busy working  and opening a club in alaska  noticed nothing until the girl was very far along when vivian finally learned of her daughters pregnancy she stepped up and became a solicitous and helpful grandma the birth of marguerites son ends the book  there are many additional scenes and people in the autobiography including young marguerites best friend louise preteen bailey jrs first girlfriend joyce a loose gal sketches from the depression marguerites proud th grade graduation and much more all this gives us a good feel for the childrens early years sadly marguerite and her brother were damaged by their parents casual neglect and made to feel inferior by blatant white bigotry this deeply affected marguerite for her entire life  theres something about maya angelou her demeanour her ladylike manners her resolve is it any wonder she became a national treasure an incident that should have robbed her of her innocence during her early development in childhood hardly dented her spirit and without an ounce of bitterness she formed a detached shell around herself perhaps in a form of protection against the world that told her she wasnt good enough and the adults who failed to protect her properly her whole outlook on life making her so wise beyond her years her entire childhood spent as a loner allowed her to be an observer and gave her a thirst for education and improving her path in life she was a tremendous inspiration and this book showcases her development from an innocent naive like child into a woman of immense quality and substance this book is part one of a series of memoirs that she wrote this book is the first autobiography of maya angelou maya lived with her grandmother in a small southern town she had a lot of tough and terrible experiences at a young age she was raped at eight years old by her moms boyfriend and dealt with extreme discrimination this book was an eyeopener and so honest i look forward to reading a book by her every month for many more months then there was the pain a breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart the act of rape on an eightyearold body is a matter of the needle giving because the camel cant the child gives because the body can and the mind of the violator cannot   this was a powerful read that broke my heart when i read how maya was raped at the age of  beautifully written and full of emotions this book is this is my third time reading this book  i think that this is an important book angelou relates her experiences of growing up black in america this book covers birth  even though at times this book is really painful to read when shes raped at age  when she goes to the white dentist i think it is important to read it 
The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ,while certainly not comprehensive here are some of my observations from reading this entire book in three days   nephi is hard for the proud to like if this sounds sacrilege and youve never had this thought before congratulationsyoure probably not proud but pride is something i struggle with so his why cant you all just be more like me attitude can be a stumbling block but the thing to remember is he was called of god and although his personality might make me less wont to invite him to a party his righteousness is absolute and ultimately those who are called to be our leaders are meant to be followed this means that the relief society president who drives me batty not my current one still has the mantle of leadership and it is my responsibility to adjust my pride so that i can learn the gospel laman and lemuel while probably slightly justified in finding their younger brother too much to take allowed their pride to turn to sin which resulted in the loss of the spirit and thus the second promise of the lord is fulfilled that inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence they didnt and they were  the word durst is used quite frequently  the lineage of authorship foreshadows the laterday church established by joseph smith nephi gives the small plates to his brother jacob not to any of his own children sort of similar to how hyrums children were later leaders for the lds church but not josephs own i found that interesting i wonder if there was an ancient rlds church out there  the allegory of the lord in the vineyard found in jacob is profound and deeply relevant to our day  there were some slackers that were handed the plates  race does not matter the line between nephite and lamanite was so blurred throughout their history that it wasnt a matter of race the distinction was between those who were lived the commandments of god and those who ignored them the nephites who turned bad were the worst of all those were some scary dudes  ive often wondered why there are so many details of the wars im sure there are multiple and deeper reasons but im leaning towards mormon just being really interested in it after all he was in charge of the entire nephite army when he was only  i can imagine him looking through all the old plates and scrolls and loving all the details captain moroni teancum helaman and moronihah left its a manly book if only their wives could have been bloggers  sadly the history is dictated by which war was in what year i dont think their history differed from that of any other civilization we mark time by our skirmishes and conquests the peace and love that existed while christ visited and the effect his visit had for generations to come stands in stark contrast  the sacrament is sacred jay and i had a discussion a couple of weeks ago where he pointed out that taking the sacrament is symbolic of partaking of the tree of life after reading christs words to his disciples i absolutely agree i think we endanger our spirits when we partake unworthily or even absentmindedly  it truly matters who our leaders are i found this discovery extremely apropos with the current change in leadership of this church as well as the leadership of our country it takes a wise humble and righteous person to effectively lead his people in peace and prosperity whereas a corrupt leader inevitably leads those who follow to destruction every time  being rich isnt the point of being prosperous i think a great stewardship comes with becoming rich its almost a test to see how you handle it ive been feeling covetous lately for a large home you see these monster homes being built everywhere around here and its gotten into my head that i must have one nothing less than  square feet will do its pretty clear throughout the book that those the lord blesses with prosperity doesnt entitle them to get caught up with their money and belongings the outcome is never good when this happens so im going to nip this feeling in the bud and hopefully do it before the riches come by the way i dont think having a  square foot house is bad but coveting one before you need it or can afford it certainly is  moroni was totally improvising at the end he didnt know when hed die so he just kept adding stuff at the end and there is some really good stuff at the end  the moral of the story seems to be repentance the theme throughout is keep my commandments and you will prosper in the land but as no one does that perfectly except my good friend nephi who really im just envious of because he never seems to stumbleand who doesnt stumble the only way to do it is to repentcontinually  the best part of this experience has been today there is a certain famous verse although when i read it it wasnt a verse but merely part of the second to last page where moroni challenges the reader to pray with a sincere heart to discover the truth of the book my greatest fear while reading was that i would feel exactly the same afterwards i wanted to feel more and an inner voice sounded off a worry about what id think if i didnt  i didnt know if id get the burning bosom i wanted it but knew i couldnt force it so i decided to fast the entire day and made arrangements with my sister to have her watch my children while i went to the temple it was while i was driving to her high school to drop them off and after i switched the cd playing from a mix to a mormon tabernacle choir recording i knew no burning would come from listening to timbaland that it came peace like a river started to play while i was going through the drive through at carls jr to get lunch for my boys and the melody and words peace like a river  faith like a river hope like a river love like a river and i felt overwhelmed with such a spirit of joy and love for my savior  thats it thats it there are wars and rumors of wars and corruption and sin and secret combinations and even total destruction but with christ there is peace and hope and charity the book of mormon boldly teaches us the commandments of god and of his plan so that the faith hope and peace can be felt  this book is true it is not written by a genius of manipulation by their fruits ye shall know them and this is good fruit it testifies of christ and because it does it uplifts the soul elder ballard of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints talking to a group of graduates at byuhawaii encouraged us to use the media specifically blogs to teach of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints id like all who read this post to know that this is a book that has changed my life it is a book that can change anyones life if read with an open heart and mind it testifies of jesus christ our atoning savior it was translated by joseph smith jr who was a prophet of god ive read this book many times and i learn something new every time i spent a year and a half in brazil teaching from and about this book i use this book to help raise my children in righteousness abiding by its principles will get you nearer to god than any other book i know that this is true for it has worked in my life id encourage all who read this comment to also read this book my mom gave me the book of mormon as a gift to me when i was still a student at seattle university i reading it off and on for the next week or so and determined that it was an obscure history book with weird names placenames and events and in fact could even have been written by a science fiction writer especially after reading about the role of the liahona  a currentday device that must have been a gps of some sort powered by mental focus it also sounded so much like the king james version of the bible in places that i couldnt help but think the author had been taught with that book  the history of the nephites and lamanites were typical stories of the rise and fall of nations  all explained by the book as occurrences of falls from righteousness and conversions to righteousness to me it sounded a lot like an amateurs attempt to put a spiritual face on historical events and so i put it down and forgot about it for many years i picked it up again years later at the encouragement of a crippled banker i had met at a financial seminar held in provo utah the seminar was not that interesting and he recommended that i read it again but this time he said pray and ask god if the book is true or not sit down clear your head and ask your heavenly father to allow the spirit to teach you the truths of this history book and if it is true at all you will get a warm familiar feeling and your focus will be singleminded if it isnt correct you will feel nothing different but if you dont pray about it first sincerely in your heart with an open mind and heart then you may feel nothing only your private spiritual effort will allow you to be in the frame of mind to read it through  so i did and yes what he told me was correct i spent more than two weeks totally and spiritually absorbed in the book of mormon the spiritual lessons learned by the various kings and rulers and characters in the book became real as i placed myself in their shoes and observed my life my struggles my accomplishments and my spiritual distresses as results of my dependence on myself and the worldly things surrounding me things such as my preoccupation with money and career and my own shortcomings as a man things i believed to be controllable if i had the right training the right exercises the right positive can do mental attitude  the book of mormon helps me to realize that i was on the wrong track or rather i was doing many good things but for the wrong reasons i continue to read it today  but perhaps with more depth of understanding  thanks to others in my church leaders and members like myself  who have testified how they too learned important life lessons from the characters and stories in the book and how it remains a reminder of how what we do now affects our destiny and how jesus the christ the annointed one has played an all important role in our salvation i highly recommend anyone to site down by yourself and ask god to allow his spirit to permeate your own soul and open your mind to the lessons the book contains before and as you read it without sounding sacreligious i am profoundly grateful for this book its a book about answers to personal challenges its a book about how to live your life its a book about two civilizations and their relationship with a loving father in heaven there really isnt a rating you could give something so profound and precious and to this i apologize it is the best book i have ever read this is at the top of my favorite list for anyone who hasnt read this yet and would like a free copy id be glad to send you one  its worth your time just be prepared to have your life changedfor the better having been raised in the church of jesus christ of latterday saints i was exposed to this book at an early age regardless i did not seriously read this book until my early s at that time i truly wanted to know for myself if it was the word of god as proclaimed by the church i belonged to because of my experience with this book and the spirit of god my life was enhanced immeasurably  i know that jesus christ lives and is the resurrected savior of mankind i know that god exists and i know that he truly loves me because of the gift of his sons life and atonement i do not have to guess who i am and what i am here for this book and the holy spirit of god have made it plain to me am i fanatical delusional find out for yourself put the book to the test  read it then ask god the father in the name of christ if it is true  he will manifest the truth of it unto you this is something between you and your god only you can do this for yourself no one can stand in for you here he does answer sincere prayers and he will speak peace unto your soul two weeks ago i didnt know i was having appendicitis i thought i was dying seriously as in calling my family from where i lay curled up on the floor i can walk a few blocks now so thats great go grandma as for being able to concentrate on things it pretty much consists of watching monk reruns and reading the book of mormon before i go to sleep  ive never had surgery before and i have a lot more understanding for those who cant take care of themselves its like living in a cage only your body is the cage  i wrote this part several months ago it is hard for me to know which bookshelf to put this on because ive read it many times and im currently reading it like the bible i turn to it all the time it has an honored place on my bedside table so i can read from it morning and night it is referred to as a second testament of christ  for anyone who thinks that mormons are not christian people it might be helpful to read this book before coming to that conclusion o like all books of scripture such as the quran or the dhamapada it is uplifting it brings peace and it helps me have a sense of my place in the universe there is no greater peace in my life than to know that i am loved and known by god  count leo tolstoy the great russian author statesman and philosopher held this opinion as to the possible future destiny of the american religion founded under the instrumentality of the prophet joseph smith thomas j yates related an experience he had while a student at cornell university in  he had the privilege of meeting dr andrew d white former president of cornell and at the time us ambassador to germany upon learning that mr yates was a mormon dr white made an appointment to spend an evening with him at which time he related an experience he had had with count tolstoy while serving as us foreign minister to russia in  dr white visited often with count tolstoy and upon one occasion they discussed religion we quote from elder yates account of this discussion as related to him by dr white  dr white said count tolstoy i wish you would tell me about your american religion  we have no state church in america replied dr white  i know that but what about your american religion  patiently then dr white explained to the count that in america there are many religions and that each person is free to belong to the particular church in which he is interested   to this tolstoy impatiently replied i know all of this but i want to know about the american religion catholicism originated in rome the episcopal church originated in england the lutheran church in germany but the church to which i refer originated in america and is commonly known as the mormon church what can you tell me of the teachings of the mormons   well said dr white i know very little concerning them they have an unsavory reputation they practice polygamy and are very superstitious  then count leo tolstoy in his honest and stern but lovable manner rebuked the ambassador dr white i am greatly surprised and disappointed that a man of your great learning and position should be so ignorant on this important subject the mormon people teach the american religion their principles teach the people not only of heaven and its attendant glories but how to live so that their social and economic relations with each other are placed on a sound basis if the people follow the teachings of this church nothing can stop their progress  it will be limitless there have been great movements started in the past but they have died or been modified before they reached maturity if mormonism is able to endure unmodified until it reaches the third and fourth generation it is destined to become the greatest power the world has ever known  because of his discussion with count tolstoy upon his return to the united states dr white secured a set of the church works and placed them in the cornell university library  this book has facilitated greater change in my life than any other book making it my alltime favorite book it testifies of gods goodness and love it better clarifies his whole plan for us where we came from why in the world we are alive and what happens after we die it is written by gods ancient prophets in the american continents whereas the bible is written by gods ancient prophets mainly in the middle east the inspiring words in the book of mormon along with the words in the bible testify of christ and teach his gospel that he died for us that we will live again be resurrected and that he made a unique sacrifice for us that we can repent and live with god again atonement  the reason why i feel that the book of mormon is essential along with the bible for testifying of christ is because some parts of the bible are understood differently probably because through time many important parts of the bible were changed i guess to oppress the people and teach them what the leaders wanted them to know so sometimes it may be confusing good thing the holy spirit helps us understand truth whereas the book of mormon is exactly the message the ancient prophets wrote i think that some grammarpunctuation has been added since thats how we write now in english  for example the beautiful message of the creation found in the beginning pun of the bible is better understood with the additional clarification found in the book of mormon as far as i understand every other christian religion besides the church of jesus christ of latterday saints believes that when adam took of the forbidden fruit he somehow thwarted gods plan for us and thats why we live in this terrible state of living whereas with the additional explanations from the revelations of other ancient prophets we understand that the fall was an essential part of gods plan of happiness eve understood this when she said were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed and never should have known good and evil and the joy of our redemption and the eternal life which god giveth unto all the obedient moses  adam and eve knew that they couldnt be obedient to gods first commandment without transgressing the barrier between the bliss of the garden of eden and the terrible trials and amazing growth of mortal life the fall could not happen without a transgressionan exercise of moral agency amounting to a willful breaking of a law dallin h oaks  moses  everything must have its opposite to provide us free agency and without free will salvation is impossible it is so great to know that god sent us here for a reason and that by struggling through learning and growing here on earth we are becoming closer to him  my favorite chapter in the book of mormon is  nephi chapter  and it isnt just because its reference is easy to remember favorite verse is  te he my favorite verses are really  i could just eat them up i love the explanation of what the fall caused and how relevant it is in our lives  the chapter is about an ancient prophet named lehi explaining to his son about christ redeeming us from our sins why it is necessary that there is evil and pain in the world and of course the fall  without understanding the fall when adam ate the fruit and caused both physical and spiritual death to happen on earth how can we really understand why we need christ the only way we can live again after we die both physically and spiritually by the way we die spiritually meaning we cant be with heavenly father again when we sin because no unclean thing can be in the presence of god christ can make us clean again even though its work its a good feeling and way worth any sacrifice  here is what mormonorg it says about the book of mormon  the restoration of truth the book of mormon  as part of the restoration of the gospel god brought forth the book of mormon another testament of jesus christ by the power of god joseph smith translated this book from an ancient record written on gold plates the book of mormon is a record of gods dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the americas and contains as does the bible the fullness of the everlasting gospel introduction to the book of mormon  the book of mormon is a powerful witness of jesus christ it helps us understand his teachings including those in the bible examples of book of mormon witnesses of christ include  nephi who saw the birth and death of christ in a vision  nephi  the brother of jared who saw the lord because of his great faith ether  the prophet samuel the lamanite who prophesied of christs coming and gave the signs of his birth and death helaman  christ himself who after his resurrection appeared to the people of ancient america and invited them to come forward one by one to see and touch him until they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves  nephi   in the bible jesus told his apostles other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd john  soon after he was resurrected the lord visited these other sheepthe inhabitants of ancient america during this visit to the american continent recorded in the book of mormon jesus christ invited people to feel the wound marks in his hands and feet and side taught his gospel called twelve disciples to teach his gospel healed the sick prayed for the people performed miracles  in september  joseph smith was visited by a heavenly messenger named moroni in the same way that angels often appeared to church leaders in the new testament moroni informed joseph that god had a work for him to do and told him that a record of the ancient inhabitants of the american continent was buried in a nearby hill he stated that the record contained the fullness of the gospel of jesus christ joseph smithhistory   in september  joseph received the record which was written on thin plates of gold joseph translated the book into english by the inspiration of god and called the book the book of mormon it is named after mormon an ancient prophet who compiled the sacred record the book verifies as another testament of christ the reality and divinity of jesus christ it is then a second witness that affirms the truth of the bible since its publishing in  the book of mormon has blessed the lives of millions of people through its powerful message about jesus christ and his gospel  mormonorg has tons of great links too  i will always have this book on my currentlyreading shelf along with the bible because i read daily from these books when i choose to study them straight through the very day i finish the book i start it again it is really cool that god can teach different or more powerful truths to you the more you read it otherwise how boring would that be to keep rereading the same books ive heard it said by many that they hadnt noticed certain passages before even though they had read that chapter many times the lord teaches line upon line when you are ready for another truth to build upon what you know he blesses you with that knowledge often by you reading the scriptures and have a passage teach you something new i dont know what i can say more than has been said but i wish to add my voice to those who know this book to be true i would like to issue a challenge to everyoneregardless whether or not you have read it   obtain a brand new unmarked copy of the book of mormon one of the free copies that missionaries give out works great you will also need a colored pencil   over a period of  days  pagesday scan read the book doing three things  circle any reference to christs names ie savior redeemer lamb of god messiah etc  shade in any of his attributes ie mercy omnipotent omniscient etc  underline any of his direct words ie  ne  i will work a great and marvelous work among the children of men  this isnt meant to be an indepth study of the book but rather to show a person that this book really does testify of christ  some of my favorite passages   nephi  pg   i nephi will show unto you that the tender mercies of the lord are over all those whom he hath chosen because of their faith to make them might even unto the power of deliverance   nephi   pg   for we labor to write to persuade our children and also our brethren to believe in christ and to be reconciled to god for we know that it is grace that we are saved after all we can doand we talk of christ we rejoice in christ we preach of christ we prophesy of christ and we write according to our phophecies that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission or their sins  jacob  pg   wherefore we search the prophets and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope and our faith becometh unshaken insomuch that we truly can command in the name of jesus and the very trees obey us or the mountains or the waves of the sea  alma  pg   therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to god that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies yea and also give us strength that we might retain our cities and our lands and our possessions for the support of our people yea and it came to pass that the lord our god did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us yea insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls and did grant unto us great faith and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him  all of moroni  pg   there are many more that i am not able to post i encourage everyone to read this book many many times ive read some of the other reviews of this book that point out some intellectual garbage that they say cant be proved without actually looking at the evidence or the literary problems with the book theyre missing the whole point of it this book can only be understood with a spiritual sense that many people ignore or fight against to justify their lifestyles i have been reading this book every night ever since i was in high school it continually reminds me to be a better person you cant understand it without reading the book and paying attention to a spiritual sense you may not yet be familiar with a must read each day hope for the helpless and those willing to do what is right no matter what the challenge writing by individuals and church representatives anciently who were willing to live by the higher law charity not just moses  commandments an eye for an eye equal justice i memorized the beatitudes as a member of my baptist churchs  club  books in the bible  join by memorizing the books names stay a member by memorizing scriptures and love to read about the same sermon given to descendants of those who fled jerusalem before it feel so nice to have a volume of books by those who successfully sufficiently sacrificed and grew to learn more of gods eternal plan this is the most stunning lifechanging book i am a bible fan and so i am quite familiar with the principles taught by jesus christ this book is a similar book but it was written by prophets in the ancient americas instead of palestinemiddleeast area the prophets likewise taught of the coming of jesus christ and lobbied for improved christian morals among the people and were lead by the spirit of lord i find the language very new testament old english style but very clear and its easy to crossreference with the bible since there are crossreferences throughout i have actually read this book a number of times and i actually am not getting tired of it it seems to invite the spirit of god into my day so i have been reading it in the morning its a very inspiring book i highly recommend it hands down the best book ive ever read i make a point to read it everyday this set of scriptures is the best way to learn about the core beliefs of the members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints aka the mormons this book like the holy bible help us to learn more about our savior jesus christ and his mission and role in our heavenly fathers plan of salvation as well as in our own lives this book coupled with prayer will help as joseph smith jr said any person grow closer to christ as well as better come to know him  as i continually read and reread this book it helps be to better become a disciple of christ and strive to live a better and happier life after i read this book through sincere pray and asking god if this book was really true i came to find out for myself through the holy ghost that this book is true and was written and prepared by ancient prophets of god for us  i would recommend this book to everyone and would be willing to discuss or answer any questions that someone might have this book was voted one of the top ten lifechanging books by readers of parade magazine each time i read it i understand something new and find something profound and relevant to my life if you understand the context of how the book was translated and appreciate the fact that an uneducated teenager could never have written it especially in about  days you cannot deny that it is another true testament of jesus christ as a young girl of  i read this book during a lonely summer my family and i had just moved from tennessee and it was my first summer in utah it was a slow summer since i had only made a few friends so i decided to hole up in my room at night open my windows and let the sweet desert air blow into my room as i read this book  from that sweet experience i have a deep love and appreciation for the book of mormon aside from being a collection of truly fascinating and amazing stories this book is a true testament of jesus christ through the power of the holy ghost i came to understand the precious truths that stretch throughout the pages of this book i am forever grateful to the men who recorded their testimonies their lives and the lives of their people in this book i am also moved with deep gratitude for the sacrifices made by many to bring this book into my heart and hands this book is a true treasure a book this large in translation and covering this many years is bound to be difficult for some to get through but it is incredibly rewarding an entire civilization from beginning to end about  years worth is contained through short glimpses of those who were chosen to keep the record from generation to generation each writer has a different voice journaling what they have witnessed in wars politics exploration and most importantly religion the overarching theme of the work is a love and devotion to god and jesus christ who reveals himself to them to confirm the beliefs they had clung to for centuries it is a quite remarkable work and has left a serious imprint on my mind and heart i am rereading it again i think for the th time and it never ceases to speak truth to my soul and increase my love for the generations before ours ive read this book cover to cover  times and keep rereading and pondering it the old testament and new testament of the holy bible testify of the divinity and earthly mission of jesus christ this is another testament of jesus christ which tells of his visit to the peoples on the american continent following his crucifixion and resurrection  i told the brethren that the book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book joseph smith  isaiah described it a marvelous work and a wonder who could avoid a review of such a controversial and dare i say influential book being myself a proponent of the faith i could simply refer one to the introduction to the present edition  in which the book is described as a volume comparable to the bible a claim which some might label blasphemy but i do indeed feel that in the sense that the book of mormon defines the everlasting gospel the book of mormon does indeed contain as does the bible the fulness of the everlasting gospel  joseph smith stated a quotation also included in the introduction that the book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book one could of course debate the manner in which such a statement should be understood but as to getting nearer to god by abiding by its precepts than by any other book of that proposition i am not certain i have for instance felt just as close to god in reading the bible and abiding by its precepts as i have in reading the book of mormon nevertheless i believe each holds equal value in revealing god and guiding a christian in following jesus  i would say that the book is well worth giving a read even if ones interest is merely comparative i would just as readily suggest one read the bible the quran or any other religious text which provides a formative basis for belief and conduct that i personally feel it of unique religious value is certainly true but the book in and of itself is a marvel of 
"Moby-Dick or, the Whale",my uncle took me fishing when i was a child he did all the fishing while i just hung around observing during one such trip i had a fishing rod in my hand i didnt want to catch anything the thought of catching a live fish was unbearable i was a scaredycat and an imaginative one with a penchant for melodrama and then it happened i felt a strong tug on the rod it was the worst experience of my life i just stood there frozen unable to reel in the fish my spot might as well have been amity island and the fish might as well have been jaws ah the mind of a child i was scared and feeling sorry for the damn fish at the same time worst of all people were staring at me  giphy  it was not my destiny to be a master fisherman i wish captain ahab had come to the same realization as i did his pride led to his downfall  moby dick is the ultimate tale of man versus nature what could be more formidable than a sperm whale  the oceans largest predator a being so powerful not even the mighty orca the oceans most skillful killer can defeat it who would dare hunt such a creature  humans  eminemjobforme  the name orca comes from the latin phrase orcinus orca which translates as of the kingdom of the dead great white sharks have the word great as part of their name then there are sperm whales couldnt they think of something more dignified i know why theyre named that way but come on  whaling was a highly lucrative business bloody and dangerous but lucrative nonetheless told from the sailor ishmaels perspective the story follows ahab captain of the whaling ship pequod who embarks on a quest for vengeance against a giant sperm whale who maimed him  ahab is a man who doesnt know when to quit i would have noped out of there after the first encounter but thats not ahab hes not like other girls he wants to kill moby dick no matter the cost ahabs fury and hatred are almost as big as his ego he is consumed by his desire to defeat the white whale its his only obsession  i have mixed feeling about this novel i understand its an important piece of literature its filled with metaphors and double entendres its just not my cup of peppermint tea  why was the whale called dick hes just swimming in the ocean snacking on squid sharks and fish minding his business he sunk a few ships but only because he was defending himself ahab is the dick of the story  i find the real story of moby dick much more fascinating than the fictional one moby dick was inspired by a reallife white sperm whale named mocha dick his story is as fascinating as it is tragic  is the sea a harsh mistress or are some people just stupid  check the weather forecast before you go sailing dont hunt giant marine mammals pack sunscreen and put on beyond the sea i was that precocious brat who first read the whaleesque sized mobydick at the age of nine why i had my reasons and they were twofold  i was in the middle of my i love jacques cousteau phase and this book had a picture of a whale on the cover   it was on the bookshelf juuuuust above my reach and so obviously it was good because it was clearly meant to be not for little kids and that made my little but bloated ego very happy  so in retrospect were war and peace and le pre goriot and the great gatsby in retrospect there may have been an underlying pattern behind my childhood reading choices from what i remember i read this book as a sort of encyclopedia a bunch of short articles about whaling and whale taxonomy and many ways to skin a whale and occasional interruptions from little bits of what as i now see it was the plot it was confusing and yet informative  like life itself is to nineyearolds  what do i think about it now having aged a couple of decades well now i bow my head to the brilliance of it the unexpectedly beautiful language the captivating and apt metaphors the strangely progressive for its time views the occasional wistfulness interrupted by cheek the first third of it left me spellbound flying through the pages eager for more  just look at this bit this unbelievable prose that almost makes me weep yes im a dork who can get weepy over literature i blame it on my literatureteacher mother so there whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats off  then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i quietly take to the ship bits like this is what made me stay up at night pouring over the pages i could finally see what my nineyearold past self did not care about and appropriately so in the light of literalmindedness and straightforwardness that children possess  melvilles constant persistent comparison of whaling to life itself using bits and pieces of whaling beliefs and rituals to illuminate the dark nooks and crannies of human souls to show that deep down inside regardless of our differences we all run on the same desires and motives and undercurrents of spirit human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form the elusive white whale is what we are all chasing in one form or another different for all of us different in how we see it and approach it and deal with it its what we all pursue  the difference is how melville gives us one of the extremes the views of a singleminded fanatic of one who puts everything aside sacrifices everything and everyone else for the sake of a dream of a desire of a goal the person who is capable of leading others unified in his focused narrow overwhelmingly alluring vision we can call ahab a madman we can also call him a great leader a visionary of sorts  had he only used the charisma and the drive and the singleminded obsession to reach a goal less absurd less suicidal less selfish had he with this monomaniac singlemindedness led a crusade for something we think is worthwhile would we still call him a madman or would we wordlessly admire his neveraltering determination isnt the true tragedy here in ahab focusing his will on destruction and blind revenge leading those hes responsible for to destruction in the name of folly and pride is that where the madness lies for there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men   mobydick the elusive and largely symbolic whale  until that is the last haunting three chapters where the chased ide fixe becomes terrifyingly real and refuses to humor ahabs life goal  is a force of nature so beautiful so majestic and breathtaking so lovingly described by melville over pages and pages even though in all honesty he breaks up the fascination but trying unsuccessfully to persuade the reader that the amazing whale is just a fish  really the idea of a mere human considering it his right his goal to stand up to the majestic nature force armed with a destructive deadly weapon and bring it to the end after a long chase in the ultimate gesture of triumph  that idea is chilling in its unremarkability humans taming and conquering nature bending it to our will and desires the world being our oyster  all that stuff it is not new it is what helped drive the industrial expansion of the modern society it is what makes us feel that we are masters of our world that our planet is ours to do whatever we humans please but mobydick finally abandoning his run from ahab and standing up to him with such brutal ease is a reminder of the folly of such thinking and the reminder that there are forces we need to reckon with no matter how full of ourselves we may get  why only three stars you ask when clearly i appreciate the greatness of the classic because the metaphors and parallels and meandering narration at times would get to be too much because i quite often found my mind and attention easily wandering away in the last twothirds of the book needing a gargantuan effort to refocus this what took of a star and a half resulting in  seastars grudgingly but yet willingly given to this classic of american romanticism buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last it was the deviouscruising rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found another orphan  a friend of mine told me one day that reading a book in its original language and reading the exact same book but this time in translation is like reading two different books i was so skeptical about this because the translation is supposed to be like a bridge between you and any novel you want to read but alas he was sort of right and no this has nothing to do with the translation i read first though sometimes you can pick up a book with a poor translation and i would agree that that makes a lot of difference in fact that might end up ruining your whole reading experience  as for this particular case i dont believe there was something wrong with the edition i picked up back in  but the other way around i feel like i actually read moby dick the real moby dick and it was partly because of the translation that i ended up loving this book i even sent an email to the translator and thanked him for his great job and somehow making this book one of my alltime favorites literally the number one back then so was melville himself who ruined this second reading experience for me of course not well perhaps just a little bit  i must confess that reading moby dick in its original english was rather hard both language wise and content wise whereas reading the book in translation was complexyes i would agree on thatyet mostly readable understandable and quite enjoyable the content was by no means an obstacle when i read the book the first time though i had to look up some wordsnautical terms sea vocabulary and whatnotthat id never come across before words that i didnt know in spanish and words that perhaps at this point i have even forgotten this second time i was so nave and optimistic i genuinely thought i could read moby dick in english when i just started reading in english two years agoi know such a bad decision since moby dick was our pick in september for our book clubseptember and im finishing it in november holy cowi thought it would be a great idea to read it along so i said to myself you already read it once and you loved it you understood the story you enjoyed the nonfiction chapters the most go warrior and pick it up again what on earth is the worst thing that could happen well it turns out that i ended up hating one of my alltime favorite books nothing much right  honestly my main problem with moby dick was a particular thing that is impossible to translate into spanish therefore i didnt know that the book was written in this way until i picked it up again thou ye thy thee and repeat thou ye thy thee and again yes i had no idea that melvilles writing style in moby dick was like the king james bible or any random shakespeares play here i might be mistaken it works maybe but reading a huge book written in this way was utterly painful and quite overwhelming even when i sort of got used to the language even when i watched a couple of videos to understand how to use those pronouns the verb conjugation and the like i couldnt get the point was it supposed to be symbolic i dont know but this time i found the dialogue very unnatural and somewhat unrealistic but who knows perhaps my impressions happen to be like that only because of my deep disappointment on the other hand the nonfiction chapters were again those that i enjoyed the most this time slightly more to my surprise and mainly again because of the contentthe cetological chapters are still vividly in my head i admit i was unprepared for reading a book like moby dick in my second language but even so i cant help but think that the author and his prose didnt make things easier it was the other way around basically now i just have to live with thisthe fact that moby dick is not anymore what i thought it wasand be prepared for the third time that for the record im pretty sure wont be in the near future by any means  but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou launchest navies of fullfreighted worlds theres that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee  aye aye and ill chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out  captain ahab  stripped of its multitude of digressions mobydick is at heart a fantastic adventure and literary treasure brimming with symbolism and some of the most colorful and memorable characters ever encountered so why only  stars generously rounded up to make a full  well simply because the departures from the main narrative were often mindnumbing and effectively brought the momentum of the plot almost to a standstill for me interspersed at frequent intervals among the compelling fictional aspects of the book are a plethora of nonfictional descriptions of the whaling industry the various species of whales the anatomy of the whale descriptions of whaling lines whale processing gruesome but sometimes interesting whale paintings whale writings and whale ships now dont get me wrong im as interested as the next whale enthusiast insert a bit of sarcasm here in the real nitty gritty details of this magnificent beast and the fundamentals of the trade but i felt like i was reading a textbook half the time  so maybe im not a nonfiction kind of gal and true facts are not my cup of tea well i dont think this is the case what initially prompted me to read mobydick  aside from being able to say i actually accomplished this feat  was my reading of in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex by nathaniel philbrick a little over a year ago i hesitantly picked up this nonfiction book as part of a group read i didnt really think i would make it through that one much less actually enjoy it however i was pleasantly surprised at how engrossed i became in that true account of another fated whaling expedition i learned a lot without ever feeling like i was dozing off in the middle of a grand lecture hall when i realized that herman melville was inspired by that tragic story to write his own mythical tale i was convinced to give it a try  all grumbling aside there is much to admire and even enjoy in mobydick for one when in the moment the chase is one of the most thrilling scenes in all of literature i couldnt get enough of this and it seemed so shortlived compared to how long i waited for it to arrive its not to be missed however as i mentioned from the start the characters are wonderful  so welldrawn and easily identifiable captain ahab queequeg starbuck stubb flask ishmael pip fedallah and the rest wont soon be forgotten then of course theres mobydick it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honourable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood many scenes are comic in nature especially one in the beginning involving a couple of very unlikely bedfellows last but not least is perhaps the whole point of the book  captain ahabs obsession with the white whale his singleminded determination to seek revenge on one of natures creations at the expense of the entire crew is extraordinary like a man possessed ahab is consumed by this destructive purpose despite the vehement forewarnings of the scrupulous first mate starbuck vengeance on a dumb brute that simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous i wont say much more here in case you succumb to your curiosity and venture to pick up this tome i will say that the climax of the novel is stunning and i truly did enjoy the ending  i cant really recommend this book to any particular group of readers if you feel the urge to read this i wont discourage you if you begin and throw in the towel i wont blame you if you perchance reach the last page and proclaim this a masterpiece then id congratulate you my idea of the most rewarding experience would be to read philbricks in the heart of the sea my review combined with the abridged version of this book  i wish i had thought of that before  read this during the time i spent at a science conference in cuba back in the last century  i think if i hadnt been so lacking diversion  isolated in the hotel by the extortionate price of tourist taxis  i would never have made it through the book there are certainly passages written with considerable literary power  he piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it  and the story is certainly not without interest the mad captain hunting his nemesis across the seas his obsession driving his crew into extremis  but none of that can expunge the memory of what felt like literally a hundred pages of dry mechanical exposition about the mechanics of whaling and the minutiae of the whaling industry  it was i have to say a slog that i wouldnt encourage anyone else to undertake without good reason i have read many th century classics that i found far more appealing my expectations were so low that i actually didnt mind mobydick at all the middle is the slowest part with the descriptions of ship life and whaling hurting my head quite a bit but i enjoyed the characters and most of the time being inside ishmaels mind its a denselywritten novel so be prepared i finally finished this behemoth of a book in just under a year i did in fact take around a  month or so break so that is understandable but im so glad i persevered and completed it moby dick although unfuriating and challenging at the best of times is well worth the read  the storyline generally follows a sailor called ishmael who along with new found friend and harpooner queequeg gets a job aboard the peyquod a whaling ship manned by the insane captain ahab the crew think they are just going on a typical whaling expedition but in reality ahab has bigger prizes in mind  killing the famous white whale moby dick who took his leg from him years before  i think the main reason it took me so long to finish this book was that i picked it up at a bad time i picked it up last september when i already had a lot of books quite hefty ones at that which i had challenged myself to read in the year so i got  pages in and had to put it down in favour of others and then the months passed and i was nervous to pick it up again because  this book is dense as hell and  its really long i would even argue too long but thats just my personal opinion  there is a lot to love in moby dick  the action sequences are impeccable you learn a lot about whaling and the actual procedures behind procuring oil spermacetti etc and there are some genuinely hilarious moments the book is littered with innuendo which i found incredibly fun to read although that might just be my immature side coming out however what slowed this read down for me and made me have to knock it down a half star was the amount of telling rather than showing there are a lot of infodump chapters in moby dick and often i felt that they took me out of the flow and rhythm of the story at times they were interesting and at times they were tied in with the actual events taking place with the characters but sometimes i felt like they were just there to bulk up the page count and display melvilles vast knowledge of whales and whaling it definitely was a bit of a road block for me  saying that i would probably read this book again not anytime soon of course but maybe a few years down the line because i think you could get a lot more out of it through subsequent readings i would definitely recommend this book to most people but just be aware that it is a timeconsuming read and it is dense but its definitely worth it in my opinion last night i dreamt i went to manderley again oops wrong book im going to leave it there just to be contrary besides call me ishmael just doesnt really do it for me sorry mr melville you should have named him slartibartfast  moby  dont forget the hyphen  dick is a notoriously difficult read normally i am too lazy to make the effort but something about this book intrigued me why is an old book about a whale a classic literature is this a thrilling high seas adventure the jaws of the th century initially i was surprised how easy the book is to read unfortunately i was lulled into a false sense of security by the deceptively easy to read first dozen or so chapters i was charmed by the beautiful prose the easygoing narrative style and the wonderful characterization of ishmael and queequeg what a great duo they are two very dissimilar people from vastly different backgrounds develop a friendship that overcome all cultural or language barriers without all that whaling shenanigans this would have been a great buddy road trip style adventure herman melville however was more ambitious than that soon after the ship pequod set sail the real epic story starts  unfortunately the pequod sailed one way and my attention often sailed in the opposite direction  this book is possibly the granddaddy of infodumps i read not learned more about whales and whaling in the th century than i bargained for the full title of the book is mobydick or the whale for me it is more like mobydick or tmi or mobydick whaleporn i was reading the book on audio and i am ashamed to say i dozed through many parts of it i did some rewinding but i estimate that at least  of the book slipped by me entirely i think if i want to confidently claim to have read mobydick for the sake of bragging rights i would have to read the print version over a few months only a couple of chapters or so a day in all fairness the numerous expositions about whales and whaling are not all unbearably tedious the tone in which the author narrated these parts is usually informal and quite accessible the difficulty lies in the sheer volume of expositions in spite of the friendly tone the narrative just rambles on and on while the plot grinds to a halt and my mind wandered off never to return  so my apologies to the readers of this review expecting some mention of the symbolism the themes etc i may be able to come up with something after a reread but at present i have zilch to offer in that department i am not even sure about the reread at this point i imagine if the first person narrative was written from the titular moby dicks perspective he would probably think something like what is this ahab guys problem i mean there he was swimming around minding his own business suddenly this old bugger made a beeline for him in his boat and tried to end his life for commercial or bragging purposes so he chomped one of the guys legs off to teach him a lesson and also as a tasty healthy lowcalorie preservativefree snack seems fair then this guy swears vengeance and becomes all monomaniacal about it wtf  i wish i could shoehorn in the phrase a whale of a time somewhere in this review because i seldom have occasions to employ this favorite clich unfortunately my enjoyment of the book is closer to a troutlike dimensions so i will have to save this phrase for some other fishy novels  heres a nice little fan art for you call me ishmael this is one of the most famous first lines of a novel in world literature but its very real significance isnt analyzed much its instructive that unlike chaim potoks asher lev the narrator here doesnt say the obvious my name is ishmael why not why the more circuitous phrasing the most obvious explanation that suggests itself is that ishmael isnt his name its just what he wants to be called and if its a selfdesignation that he picks he picks it for a reason a reason bound up with associations that todays typically bibleilliterate american readers dont recognize but that typical american readers in  would have in the book of genesis ishmael is abrahams oldest son his son by his slave hagar who is subsequently displaced as his heir by the birth of isaac abrahams son by his wife sarah in the new testament the apostle paul in passages like galatians  and romans  uses these two sons to develop a symbolic typology contrasting those who claim gods favor on the basis of natural descent and human law vs those who simply receive it as a miraculous gift but in the history of christian bible interpretation those texts were taken by calvinist expositors as literal prooftexts for the idea that god arbitrarily predestines some humans to be forgiven of sin and given eternal life in paradise while the majority are just as arbitrarily predestined to be fiendishly tortured forever in hell calvinism bulked large for centuries in americas religious consciousness shaping the way many americans understood god and christianity and melville his religious upbringing run by his dutch reformed mother was one of them so his narrators selfdesignation deliberately associating himself with the notchosen one the one arbitrarily predestined for the eternal short end of the stick has significance and lets us know at the outset that were in for a novel that has serious theological concerns more on that below  this is a novel that tries to be several things at one level its a story of seagoing adventure of a lifethreatening sort and parts of it succeed pretty well in being that its also a sociallyconscious novel it brings out the oftenexploitative treatment of sailors by the thcentury whaling industry and through the character of queequeg the cannibal harpooner on the pequod though he may not be the cannibal that the white characters cultural stereotypes make him out to be the author challenges the racist assumptions of his day the narrators conclusion that the mans a human being just as i am cut against the cultural grain then even more than it would now and its a penetrating study of the psychopathology of vengeful obsession personified by the also symbolically named captain ahab less successfully it sets out to educate the reader about whales and whaling a field where melville had vast personal experience and couldnt bear to relegate any of it to the discard pile   that aspect is less successful not because it doesnt convey information it conveys a ton of information and not mainly because some of its wrong in the thenraging dispute over whether whales are fish or mammals melville comes down on the fish side but because its mostly not wellintegrated into the narrative its steamshoveled in via a number of eyeglazing infodumps  finally and in melvilles eyes most importantly its a heavily symbolladen novel which tries to make ambitious philosophical statements about existential questions the whiteness of the whale is of course the central symbolism the decoding of which is something of a cottage industry in melville criticism as is often the case much of this scholarly posturing ignores the fact that melville didnt leave the meaning of the symbolism ambiguous he devoted a chapter to explaining it and states explicitly that it represents existential negation or nothingness at the heart of the universe see especially the last paragraph of that chapter its a statement of philosophical nihilism as grim and comprehensive as anything to be found in the work of thcentury writers like hemingway and lovecraft ahabs selfjustification by appealing to the idea that god made him this way and predestined everything he does is another key philosophical passage it parallels master prynnes godmakesmedoit defense in the scarlet letter but where hawthorne clearly views this as selfserving sophistry from a fiend melville seems to think that its true he just doesnt like the idea that its true his resentment towards calvinisms far from winsome god and towards the disliked theology pounded into his head as truth at his mothers knee colors the many references to religion in the book such as ishmaels gleeful twisting of scripture to stand it on its head and make a supposed case for joining in idol worship and father mapples disparagement of the idea of an afterlife if all that the vast majority of humans can look forward to is a calvinist hell no matter what they think or do the absence of an afterlife begins to seem positively cheery    one point that should probably be addressed in a review for modern readers is the notuncommon contemporary reaction that goes something like eeek this is a novel about whalekillers case closed no thought necessary its politically incorrect and therefore evil evil now im a staunch environmentalist and proud of it im completely opposed to whaling and support efforts to ban it and stamp it out our modern ability to recognize the validity of that position though is based on ecological knowledge people in the th century simply didnt possess for melville and his contemporaries whales were simply animals that existed to be used as a legitimate exercise of humanitys dominion oil lamp technology required their oil and they were a vast inexhaustible resource that would always be there to provide it nobody imagined that we could actually hunt a species to extinction nor imagined what effect it would have on the ocean as an ecosystem if we did we can say that their attitudes were ignorant but its not fair to brand them as morally evil or to judge the literary merits of the book on the basis of modern knowledge that would have been totally alien and unbelievable to the writer and original readers dislike for whalekilling can be a legitimate readerresponse criticism here certainly but it shouldnt be the sum total of our engagement with the novel  imo this novel is overrated by modern critics who like it primarily only because they find much of its theologicalphilosophical content as congenial at least if they only analyze it superficially as i find it uncongenial but theres enough positive content here as indicated above that i felt it earned its three stars melville is among other things a master of characterization and he can sketch scenes both on land and on water with considerable vividness to date besides billy budd sailor this is the only one of his novels ive read ive read a couple of his shorter pieces as well but i definitely do intend to read the others sometime i dont quite know where to start with this one but let me preface it by saying there is no possible way to review this book in k characters or less its a multiple pages sort of thing additionally i read this book essentially in one sitting  as part of my  hour readathon  so it may have been harder for me to digest properly moby dick begins as a moody foreboding and suspenseful tale but ends as a fable as old as time this novel in truth is multiple books in one it is the tale of moby dick and captain ahab it is a scientific foray into the world of whales and it is a mechanical manual for the intricacies of operating a whaling ship these latter two parts of the novel are particularly hard to read and painfully complicated and dense even with all my experience reading classic literature these sections were incredibly challenging for me naturally the plot driven parts of moby dick are easier to get through but i would say they only constitute about  of the novel while i think melvilles understanding was that the technical parts of his novel were necessary to understand the plot fully it makes for an extremely challenging read moby dick does spin an important tale of when obsession goes too far and also manages to curate a mysterious supernatural theme throughout i enjoyed the mysterious and gloomy aspects of this novel and i very frequently found
